Abridged,\nYet wide, the interval opposed advance,\nDaunting those resolute natures; eyes once bold\nWith gloomy hesitation reckoned up\nThe dread equivalent in human lives\nOf cubits and of yards, and hardly hoped\nOne could survive the endless unacquired\nCountry between. But from the Southron wall\nThe muskets did not hesitate, but urged\nRefusal stern; the bullets did not pause,\nNor calculate expense.

Then<span class='page-number' id='s-300' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.300]</span>\nThe heads that planned pushed swiftly to the front\nThe centre yet unhurt, where Rajasthan,\nPlaymate of death, had sent her hero sons.\nThey with a rapid royal reckless pace\nCame striding over the perilous fire-swept ground,\nNor answered uselessly the bullets thick\nNor paused to judge, but o'er the increasing dead\nLeaping and striding, shouting, sword in hand,\nRushed onward with immortal courage high\nIn mortal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, and held the lower slope.\nBut now the higher incline, short but steep,\nBaffled their speed, and as they clambered up,\nCompact and fiery, like the rapid breath\nOf Agra's hot simoom, the sheeted flame\nBelched bullets. Down they fell with huge collapse,\nAnd, rolling, with their shock drove back the few\nWho still attempted. Banned advance, retreat\nThreatening disgrace and slaughter, for a while\nLike a bound sacrifice the Rajputs stood\nDiminishing each moment. Then a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span>\nHigh-crested of the Rathore <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span> stood out\nFrom the perplexed assailants, with his sword\nBeckoning the thousands on against the few.\nAnd him the bullets could not touch; he stood\nDefended for a moment by his lease\nNot yet exhausted.

So was the fatal gorge\nFilled with the clamour of the close-locked fight.\nSword rang on sword, the slogan shout, the cry\nOf guns, the hiss of bullets filled the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span>,\nAnd murderous strife heaped up the scanty space,\nRajput and strong Mahratta <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>breathing</span> hard\nIn desperate battle. But far off the hosts\nOf Agra stood arrested, confident,\nWaiting the end. Far otherwise it came\nThan they expected. For, as in the front\nThe Rathore stood on the disputed verge\nAnd ever threw fresh strength into the scale\nWith that inspiring gesture, Baji came\nTowards him singling out the lofty crest,\nThe princely form: and, as the waves divide\nBefore a driving keel, the battle so\nBefore him parted, till he neared, he slew.\nAvoiding sword, avoiding lifted arm\nThe blade surprised the Rajput's throat, and down\nAs falls an upright poplar, with his hands\nOutspread, dying, he clutched Mahratta ground.\nLoud rose the slogan as he fell. Amazed,\nThe eager hosts of Agra saw reel back\nThe Rajput battle, desperate victory\nTurned suddenly into entire defeat,\nNot headlong, but with strong discouragement,\nSullen, convinced, rejecting the emprise.\nAs they retired, the brilliant Pathan van\nAssumed the attempt. \"Exhaust,\" the generals cried,<span class='page-number' id='s-302' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.302]</span>\n\"Exhaust the stubborn mountaineers; for now\nFatigued with difficult <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and success\nThey hardly stand, weary, unstrung, inert.\nScatter this fringe, and we march on and seize\nRaigurh and Shivaji.\" Meanwhile, they too\nNot idle, covered by the rocks and trees,\nStraining for vantage, pausing on each ledge,\nSeizing each bush, each jutting promontory,\nSome iron muscles, climbing, of the south\nLurked on the gorge's gloomy walls unseen.\nOn came the Pathans running rapidly,\nBut as the nearmost left the rocky curve\nWhere lurked the ambush, loud from stone and tree\nThe silence spoke; sideways, in front, behind\nDeath clamoured, and tall figures strewed the ground\nLike trees in a cyclone. Appalled the rest\nBroke this way and broke that, and some cried, \"On!\"\nSome shouted, \"Back!\" for those who led, fell fast.\nSo the advance dissolved, divided,—the more\nIn haste towards the plains, greeted with death\nEven while they ran; but others forward, full\nOf panic courage, drove towards the foe\nThey could not reach,—so hot a blast and fell\nStayed their unsteady valour, their retreat\nSo swift and obstinate a question galled,\nFew through the hail survived. With gloom their chiefs\nBeheld the rout and drawing back their hosts\nIn dubious council met, whether to leave\nThat gorge of slaughter unredeemed or yet\nDemand the price of so immense a loss.\n\nBut to the Prabhou came with anxious eyes\nThe Captain of the band. \"Baji,\" he cried,\n\"The bullets fail; all the great store we had\nOf shot and powder by unsparing use\nIs spent, is ended.\" And Baji Prabhou turned.\nOne look he cast upon the fallen men<span class='page-number' id='s-303' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.303]</span>\nDiscernible by their attire, and saw\nHis ranks not greatly thinned, one look below\nUpon the hundreds strewing thick the gorge,\nAnd grimly smiled; then where the sun in fire\nDescending stooped, towards the vesper verge\nHe gazed and cried: \"Make iron of your souls.\nYet if Bhavani wills, strength and the sword\nCan stay our nation's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> from o'erthrow\nTill victory with Shivaji return.\"\nAnd so they waited without word or sound,\nAnd over them the silent afternoon\nWaited; the hush terrestrial was profound.\nExcept the mountains and the fallen men\nNo sight, no voice, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was abroad,\nOnly a few black-winged slow-circling birds\nThat wandered in the sky, only the wind\nThat now arose and almost noiselessly\nQuestioned the silence of the wooded sides,\nOnly the occasional groan that marked the pang\nBy some departing spirit on its frame\nInflicted.

From behind the nearest lines\nPressed on to share their fate, and still the sea\nOf men bore onward till with violent strain\nThey reached the perilous crest; there for a while\nA slaughter grim went on and all the verge\nWas heaped and walled and thickly fortified\nWith splendid bodies. But as they were piled,\nThe raging hosts behind tore down their dead\nAnd mounted, till at last the force prevailed\nOf obstinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and upon a crest\nSwarming with foemen fought 'gainst desperate odds\nThe Southron few.

And Baji with a gruesome hand\nWiping the blood from his fierce staring eyes\nSaw round him only fifteen men erect\nOf all his fifty. But in front, behind,\nOn either side the Mogul held the gorge.\nGroaning, once more the grim Mahratta turned\nAnd like a bull with lowered horns that runs,\nCharged the exultant foe behind. With him\nThe desperate survivors hacking ran,\nAnd as a knife cuts instantly its way\nThrough water, so the yielding Mogul wall\nWas cleft and closed behind. Eight men alone\nStood in the gorge's narrow end, not one\nUnwounded. There where hardly three abreast\nHave room to stand, they faced again the foe;\nAnd from this latest hold Baji beheld\nMounting the farther incline, rank on rank,\nA mass of horsemen; galloped far in front\nSome forty horse, and on a turbaned head\nBright in the glory of the sinking sun\nA jewelled aigrette blazed. And Baji looked\nOver the wide and yawning field of space\nAnd seemed to see a fort upon a ridge,\nRaigurh; then turned and sought again the war.\nSo for few minutes desperately they strove.\nMan after man of the Mahrattas fell\nTill only three were left. Then suddenly\nBaji stood still and sank upon the ground.\nQuenched was the fiery gaze, nerveless the arm:\nBaji lay dead in the unconquered gorge.\nBut ere he fell, upon the rocks behind\nThe horse-hooves rang and, as the latest left\nOf the half hundred died, the bullets thronged\nThrough the too narrow mouth and hurled those down\nWho entered.

Sure-footed, swift\nThe hostile strength pursued, Suryaji first\nShouting aloud and singing to the hills\nA song of Ramdas as he smote and slew.\nBut Shivaji by Baji's empty frame\nStood silent and his gaze was motionless\nUpon the dead. Tanaji Malsure\nStood by him and observed the breathless corpse,\nThen slowly said, \"Thirty and three the gates\nBy which thou enterest heaven, thou fortunate soul,\nThou valiant heart. So when my hour arrives,\nMay I too clasp my death, saving the land\nOr winning some great fortress for my lord.\"\nBut Shivaji beside the dead beheld\nA dim and mighty cloud that held a sword\nAnd in its other hand, where once the head\nDepended bleeding, raised the turban bright\nFrom Baji's brows, still glittering with its gems,\nAnd placed it on the chief's.

But those laws are quite alien to the rhythm and sound-structure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> tongue; the attempt to observe them has always ended in deserved and inevitable failure. Another system has been followed here which is in agreement with the native rhythm of English speech. There what determines the metrical length or brevity of syllables is weight, the weight of the voice emphasis or the dwelling of the voice upon the sound. Where there is that emphasis or that dwelling of the voice, the syllable may be considered metrically long; where both are absent there will be, normally, a recognisable shortness which can only be cured by some aid of consonant weight or other lengthening circumstance. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> stressed syllables are metrically long in English and cannot be otherwise, however short the vowel may be, for they dominate the verse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>; this is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> which is ignored in the traditional account of English quantity and which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> experimenters in quantitative verse have chosen to disregard with disastrous consequences,—all their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> or skill in metrical technique could not save them from failure. On the other hand, a long-vowel syllable can be regarded as metrically long even if there is no stress upon it. In the quantitative system used in these poems this possibility is converted into a law: metrical length is obligatory for all such natural syllabic longs, while a short-vowel syllable unstressed is normally short for metrical purposes unless it is very heavily weighted with consonants. But the mere occurrence of two or more consonants after a short vowel does not by itself make the syllable long as it necessarily does in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span>, Latin or Sanskrit.\n\nThe system may then be reduced to the following rules:\n\n1) All stressed syllables are regarded as metrically long, as also all syllables supported on a long vowel.\n\n2) All short-vowel syllables not stressed are regarded as<span class='page-number' id='s-565' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.565]</span> short, unless they are heavily weighted with consonants. But on this last point no fixed rule can be given; in each case the ear must be the judge.\n\n3) There are a great number of sounds in English which can be regarded according to circumstances either as longs or as shorts. Here too the ear must decide in each case.\n\n4) English quantity metres cannot be as rigid as the metres of ancient tongues. The rhythm of the language demands a certain variability, free or sparing, without which monotony sets in; accordingly in all English metres modulation is admitted as possible. Even the most regular rhythms do not altogether shut out the substitution of other feet than those fixed in the normal basic arrangement of the line; they admit at least so much as is needed to give the necessary pliancy or variety to the movement. There is sometimes a very free use of such variations; but they ought not to be allowed to break the basic movement or overburden or overlay it. The same rule must apply in quantitative metres; especially in long poems modulations are indispensable.\n\nThis system is not only not at discord with the sound-structure of the language, it accords closely with its natural rhythm; it only regulates and intensifies into metrical pitch and tone the cadence that is already there even in prose, even in daily speech. If we take passages from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span></span> which were written as prose but with some intensity of rhythm, its movement can be at once detected. E.g.\n\n![Image 8](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-a.jpg)\n\nor again,\n\n![Image 9](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-b.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-566' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.566]</span>\n\nor again, from Shakespeare's prose,\n\n![Image 10](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-c.jpg)\n\nand so on with a constant recurrence of the same quantitative movement all through; or, yet more strikingly,\n\n![Image 11](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-d.jpg)\n\nThis last sentence can be read indeed as a very perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span>. The first of these passages could be easily presented as four lines of free quantitative verse, each independent in its arrangement of feet, but all swaying in a single rhythm. Shakespeare's is most wonderfully balanced in a series of differing four-syllabled, with occasional shorter, feet, as if of deliberate purpose, though it is no intention of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> but the ear of the poet that has constructed this fine design of rhythmic prose. A free quantitative verse in this kind would be perfectly possible.\n\nA more regular quantitative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> can be of two kinds. There could be lines all with the same metrical arrangement following each other without break or else alternating lines with a different arrangement for each, forming a stanza,—as in the practice of accentual metres. But there could also be an arrangement in strophe and antistrophe as in the Greek chorus.\n\nIn \"Thought the Paraclete\" the first rule is followed; all the lines are on the same model. The metre of this poem has a certain rhythmic similarity to the Latin hendecasyllable which runs ![Image 12](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-e.jpg) e.g.\n\nSōlēs | ōccĭdĕr(e) | ēt rĕ|dīrĕ | pōssūnt.\nNōbīs | cūm sĕmĕl | ōccĭd|īt brĕ|vīs lūx,<span class='page-number' id='s-567' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.567]</span>\nNōx ēst | pērpĕtŭ(a) | ūnă | dōrmĭ|ēndă.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Suns may set and come again;\n  For us, when once our brief light has set,\n  There is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> perpetual night to be slept.\n\n  <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>CATULLUS</span>\n\nBut here the metre runs ![Image 13](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/2-poems-note-f.jpg) a trochee is transferred from the closing flow of trochees to the beginning of the line, the spondee and dactyl are pushed into the middle; the last syllable of the closing trochee is most often dropped altogether. Classical metres cannot always with success be taken over just as they are into the English rhythm; often some modifications are needed to make them more malleable.\n\nIn \"Moon of Two Hemispheres\" the strophe antistrophe system has been used: the lines of the stanza differ from each other in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of the feet, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> or approach to identity is imposed; but each line of the antistrophe follows scrupulously the arrangement of the corresponding line of the strophe. An occasional modulation at most is allowed, e.g. the substitution of a trochee for a spondee. The whole poem, how-ever, in spite of its metrical variations, follows a single general rhythmic movement.\n\n\"Rose of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>\", like a previous poem \"In Horis Aeternum\", is written in pure stress metre. As stress and high accentual pitch usually coincide, it is possible to scan accentual metre on the stress principle and stress metre also can be so written that it can be scanned as accentual verse; but pure stress metre depends entirely on stress ictus. In ordinary poetry stress and natural syllabic quantity enter in as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the rhythm, but are not, qua stress and quantity, essential elements of the basic metre: in pure stress metre there is a reversal of these values; quantity and accentual inflexion are subordinate and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to build the rhythm, but stress alone determines the metrical basis. In \"Rose of God\" each line is composed of six stresses, and the whole poem is built of five stanzas, each containing four such lines; the arrangement of feet varies freely to suit the movement of thought and feeling in each line.
