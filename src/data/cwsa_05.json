But what the sons of Pandu with their own hands amassed by conquest crushing the lords of earth that these mighty ones demand, even Kuntie's sons and Madravatie's. But even when they were children, they were sought by various means to be slain of their banded foemen, savage & unrighteous, for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>greed</span> of their kingdom; yea all this is known to you utterly.

The Hall of the Lord of the Matsyas, opulent, curious with workings of pearl and the best of jewels, with seats disposed, and wreathed with garlands and full of fragrance, thither they fared, the Elders of the Kings of men. And of those that took their seats in the Hall, the first place was for both the Princes of the folk, even Virat & Drupad and those that were aged & revered among the Masters of Earth, and Rama and Janardan with their sire. Next to the King of the Panchalas sat the mighty one of the Shinis with the son of Rohinnie and very nigh to the Matsya King both Janardan and Yudhisthere, and all the sons of Drupad the King, and Bhema and Urjoon, and the sons of Madrie, and Pradyumna and Samba mighty in the battle and with the sons of Virata Abhimanyu. And all those heroes equal to their sires in prowess and beauty and strength, the princes, sons of Draupadie, sat on noble thrones curious with gold. High shone that opulent Place of Kings with the warriors there sitting in glittering ornaments and gleaming robes as heaven shines invaded by the clear bright stars. Then when those mighty ones had done with varied talk of general import they tarried in thought a moment, all those Kings gazing towards <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span>; and talk <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> over, spurred by the Madhav for business of the sons of Pandu the lion lords assembled hearkened to his word of import mighty and majestic.\n\nSrikrishna spake. \"Known is it to you all how Yudhisthere here was conquered by Subala's son in the Hall of Dicing, beaten<span class='page-number' id='s-69' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.69]</span> by fraud, and his kingdom wrested from him and compact made of exile in the forest. Though able to win the Earth by violence yet the sons of Pandu stood firmly in the truth, for truth is their chariot, and for years six & seven all the severity of that vow has been kept by these first of men. And hardest to pass this thirteenth year, lo they have passed it undiscovered before your eyes, bearing intolerable ills, even as they had sworn,—that too is known of you all,—appointed to servile office in a house of strangers, mighty, in their own might, O King, they have won through all. Since so it is, ponder now what may be for the good of the King, the son of Righteousness, and the good of Duryodhan and of the Kurus & the Pandavas, and just also and right and for the honour and glory of all. For Yudhisthere the Just would desire not the kingship of the gods itself if with unrighteousness it came. But to lordship of earth he would aspire though even in some hamlet, so it went with justice and prosperous doing. For it is known to the Kings how his father's kingdom was torn from him by the children of Dhritarashtra and how by that false dealing he fell into great peril and very hard to bear; for neither was the son of Pritha overthrown in battle by the children of Dhritarashtra in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of their own might. Yet even so the King and his friends desire that these should not come to hurt; but what the sons of Pandu gathered with their own conquering hands by force done on the lords of land, this these mighty ones seek for, Coonty's sons and the sons of Madry. But all this is known to you aright, how these even when they were children were pursued to slay them with various device by those their foemen, dishonest & fierce and bent to rob them of their realm. Seeing how that greed of theirs is grown and looking to the righteous mind of Yudhisthere and looking also to their kinship form ye your separate minds and an united counsel. For ever have these made truth and honour their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and wholly have they kept the compact, and now if they have dealing from the others otherwise than in truth and honour, they will slay the assembled children of Dhritarashtra. For when 'tis heard that these have been evilly dealt with by their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cousins</span>, the friends of Dhritarashtra's sons will gather to<span class='page-number' id='s-70' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.70]</span> protect the illdoers and they will oppose these with war, and they, opposed with war, will slay them all.

Neither do we know aright the mind of Duryodhan and what it is that he will do, and unknowing the mind of the foe, what can you decide that would be truly right to start upon?

Now if thou wilt not wage this just & righteous battle, then hast thou cast from thee thy glory and the law of thy being, and brought sin upon thy head; yea thy shame shall be eternal in the mouth of all creatures, and for one who has been honoured, shame is worse than death.

In that bright gladness of the soul there cometh to him a waning away of all grief; for when a man's heart is like a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and pure sky, the Thought findeth very quickly its firm foundation.

For the mind that followeth the control and working of the senses when they range abroad, hurleth along with it the Thought in the Spirit as the wind hurleth along a ship upon the waters. Therefore it is, O strong-armed, that his reason is firmly based only whose senses are reined in on all sides from the things of their desire.\n\nIn the night which is darkness to all creatures, the governed soul is awake & liveth; that in which all creatures wake & live, is night to the eyes of the seer. The waters enter into the vast, full & unmoving ocean and the ocean stirs not nor is troubled, and he into whom all desires even in such wise enter, attaineth unto peace and not the lover of passion. That man who casts away all desires and doeth works without craving, not melting to aught because it is his, not seeing in aught his separate self, attaineth his soul's peace. This is that Godstate, O son of Pritha, to which attaining man is not again bewildered but standing fast in it even in the hour of his ending, mounteth to Cessation in the Eternal.<span class='page-number' id='s-84' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.84]</span>","url":"/cwsa/05/the-bhagavad-gita-chapter-ii","volt":"Translations","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"05","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Translations","u":"/cwsa/05"},{"t":"Translations from Sanskrit"},{"t":"The Mahabharata"}],"nxtt":"The Bhagavad Gita - Chapter III","nxtu":"/cwsa/05/the-bhagavad-gita-chapter-iii","prvt":"The Bhagavad Gita - Chapter I","prvu":"/cwsa/05/the-bhagavad-gita-chapter-i","subt":"The First Six Chapters","yr":1902,"items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-bhagavad-gita-chapter-iii"],"t":"The Bhagavad Gita - Chapter III","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"URJOONA\nIf indeed to thy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, Thought is mightier than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, O Janardan, vexer of the host, wherefore then dost thou yoke me to a deed dire & fearful?

From food all creatures are born and from rain is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of food; but rain ariseth from the sacrifice and Sacrifice hath its root in works; works know to be born of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>, for by the imperishable word of the Eternal they were brought into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. Therefore is the Eternal everywhere and in all things; yea He hath His home for ever in the heart of the Sacrifice. This is the Wheel that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> hath set going and who goeth not with it, whose days are a wickedness, whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> & ease are in the senses, O son of Pritha, liveth his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in vain. But for the man whose whole pleasure is in the Self and who satisfies his longing with the Self, yea who is content utterly with the Self, for him there is no needful action. For indeed he hath no end at all to gain by doing neither any by not doing, he hath no dependence for end or aim on any or even this whole world of creatures. Therefore without attachment do ever the work before thee, since by doing works without attachment man reacheth the Highest. 'Twas by works alone that the men of old reached to utter perfection even Junac and the rest. Moreover even if thou lookest to the right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> of the world, thou shouldest be doing. What they see their Greatest do, even that the rest of the folk will practise, and the standard that the Best setteth up, the world will surely follow. Behold, O Partha, there is nought at all in the three worlds that I must do, there is nothing I have not or that I yet need to win, and still I move in the path of works. For verily were I not to move sleeplessly in the path of works, lo men follow utterly the way wherein I tread, O son of Pritha, then would all these worlds sink and perish, were I not to do works and I should become the creator of bastard confusion and the slayer of all these creatures. That which the ignorant do with attachment to the work, O Bharata, the wise man should do without attachment, wishing only to keep the world in its traces.

Most men are deceived by the modes of Nature, cling to the workings of these modes; these dull brains, these imperfect knowers, let not the perfect knower cause to swerve and stumble. Repose all thy works upon Me and with thy heart spiritually inclined be desireless, be selfless; then arise, fight, O Urjoona, let the fever of thy soul pass from thee. For men who with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> & without carping follow ever this my Word are released, they also, from bondage to their works, but they who carp at and follow not this my word, know of them that all their knowledge is a delusion; their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> is nought; they are lost men, Urjoona. Lo even the wise man who knoweth can but act according to his own essential nature; for to their nature all creatures come at last and what shall coercing it avail? Only in the field of each & every sense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and hate are there & ever they lie in ambush; let not the Spirit of man fall into their clutches for they are his adversaries in his great journey.

This Wisdom thou must learn by prostration and questioning and service, then shall the Knowers, they who have seen the Truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Existence</span> initiate thee in the Knowledge which when thou hast learnt thou shalt not again fall into delusion, O son of Pandou; by the knowledge thou shalt see all creatures even to the meanest in the Self, therefore in Me. Yea wert thou the vilest and most lewd in sin of all sinners, yet shouldest thou pass over to the other shore of Perversity in the ship of the Knowledge. As a fire when it hath been kindled, O Urjoona, burneth to ashes the fuel of it, even so doth the Fire of the Knowledge burn all a man's works to nothingness. In all the world there is nought that is so great and pure as Wisdom and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> who hath been made perfect by Yoga findeth Wisdom in his Self naturally and by the mere lapse of time.

The Yogin sees the reality of things and thinks \"Truly I do nothing at all\"; yea when he sees or hears or touches, when he smells and when he tastes, in his going and in his sleeping and in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>breathing</span>, whether he talk, whether he put out or take in, whether he close his eyes or open them, still he holds to it, \"Lo, 'tis but the senses that move in the fields of the senses.\" When a man doeth, reposing all his works on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> and abandoning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span>, sin cannot stay on his soul even as water on the leaf of a lotus.

The Brahmin endowed with learning and modest culture, the cow & the elephant and the very dog and the Pariah, all these the wise regard with equal eyes. Even in this human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> they have conquered this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> whose minds have taken root in that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> equality, for the Eternal also is without a defect and He looketh on all his creatures with equal eyes; therefore in the Eternal they have their root. He is not overjoyed when he getteth what is pleasant, he groweth not troubled when he tasteth bitterness, whose reason is firm & steadfast and he subjecteth not himself to delusion but knoweth the Eternal and in him abideth. His soul clings not to the touches of outward things but what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> he finds, he finds in the Self, therefore his Self is made one in Yoga with Eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> & the happiness he tastes, does not cease or diminish. For the enjoyments that are born of touch and contact are very wombs of misery, they begin and they end; the wise man taketh no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in these. For he who even on this earth and before his release from this mortal body hath strength to stand up in the speed and rush of wrath and lust, he hath Yoga, he is the happy man. That man is the Yogin whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> is within and his delight & ease are inward and an inner light illumines him & not this outer sun; he goeth to cessation<span class='page-number' id='s-94' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.94]</span> in Eternal Brahman, for he becometh Brahman.

Let a man deliver his soul by its own strength & let him not afflict his spirit to weaken it; for a man's self is its own & only friend and its own & only enemy. To that man his self is a friend who has conquered self by the Self, but when he is not in touch with his self, it worketh enmity against him like an outward foe. Now when he has mastered self and is at peace, then the Self of him is utterly at its ease, unaffected by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> & cold, pleasure or pain, imperturbable in honour & disgrace. The Yogi whose soul is satisfied with wisdom and discernment, the immovable sitter on his hilltop and victor over his senses, is called the Yogin who hath the Yoga; and gold and gravel, sand or stone is all to him <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> substance.

Even as the flame of a lamp in a windless place moveth not at all, such is the image men have handed down of a Yogin when he practiseth Yoga with his heart under rein.

The style of the original is terse, brief, packed and allusive, sometimes knotted into a pregnant obscurity by the drastic economy of word and phrase. It would have been impossible to preserve effectively in English such a style; a looser fullness of expression has been preferred sacrificing the letter to the spirit.

The Avachuri takes singularly जयाविजयाप्रत्यक्षं, i.e. before Jaya & Vijaya, her friends. The point would then be that the humiliation of her beauty was rendered still more poignant by occurring before witnesses. In this case, however, the obscurity caused by the omission of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> would be the grossest of rhetorical faults. समक्षं by itself can mean nothing but \"before her (Parvati's) very eyes\" अक्ष्णोः समीपं as Mallinatha rightly renders it.\n\nनिनिन्द found fault with, censured as defective.\n\nहि.

To translate this word \"penances\", as is frequently done, is altogether improper. The idea of self-imposed or priest-imposed penalty for sin which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> word contains does not enter even in the slightest degree into the idea of तपः which implies no more than a fierce and strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of all the human powers towards any given end.

The sense will then be \"Thou desirest a God in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>marriage</span>; well, there are gods in our home whom thou canst win by easy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span>, while Siva must be wooed by harsh asceticism in the woods.\" Or it may signify \"desired generally, desired by others\", when it will have the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of desirable. This is supported by the later इयं महेन्द्रप्रभृतिनाधिश्रियश्रुतुर्दिगीशानवमत्य & Siva Purana. I prefer therefore the latter interpretation.\n\nगृहेषु. The plural may here be used in the sense of a great mansion. The old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aryan</span> house seems to have [been] many-storied, each storey consisting of several flats; and in the palaces of princes and great nobles, it was composed of several wings and even separate piles of building. The female apartments especially formed a piece apart. Cf. the Siva Purana where Mena says\n\nकुत्र यासि तपः कर्तुं देवाः सन्ति गृहे मम ।\nतीर्थानि च विचित्राणि सन्ति किं न पितुर्गृहे ।।<span class='page-number' id='s-296' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.296]</span>\n\n\"Wherefore goest thou forth to practise austerities; gods are there in my house and wondrous holinesses, and are there none in thy father's mansion?\" A similar rendering is also favoured by another passage of the same Purana.\n\nइति स्वतनयावाक्यं श्रुत्वा तु पितरौ मुने ।\nऊचतुर्दुःखितौ भृत्वा वाष्पगद्गदया गिरा ।।\nतस्मात् त्वं भक्तियुक्तेन पूजयस्व गृहे शिवं ।\nउ मा गच्छ वनं घोरं सर्वविघ्नास्पदं सदा ।।\n\nIt is perhaps a reminiscence of these lines that induces the Avachuri & Deshpande to render \"Worship the gods in the house to gain Siva for husband\"; but this is incompatible with. मनीषिताः. If the Siva Purana then were Kalidasa's authority, we should have no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> as to our interpretation, but I have tried to show that the Siva Purana and not Kalidasa was the borrower. It is possible therefore that the former may in borrowing have misinterpreted गृहेषु and that the word has a strictly plural sense. \"There are gods desired that dwell in homes,\" i.e. not like the undesirable & homeless Siva, who must be sought by austerity in wild woods and desolate mountains. The only objection to this rendering which certainly gives the best & most poetic sense, is that the contrast with Siva is implied and not expressed, while तपः immediately following seems to be opposed to household worship. But Mena under the circumstances would not venture openly to dispraise Siva; implied dispraise therefore is what we should naturally expect. Such suppression of the implied contrast, one term expressed & the other left to be gathered is not in itself unpoetic and might be expected in a work written under the strong influence of the elliptical & suggestive style of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span>.\n\nThe reading गृहेऽपि would of course leave no doubt; it confines us to our first rendering.\n\nक्व ... क्व . Again the characteristic Sanscrit idiom implying मह्दन्तर \"a far cry\". It is a far cry from your tender body to the harshness of ascetic austerities. Notice again the fine precision, the netteté of Kalidasa's style; there are no epithets with तपः & वपुः, these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> sufficiently implied in the contrasting क्व ... क्व and in the simile that follows.<span class='page-number' id='s-297' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.297]</span>\n\nशिरिषपुष्पं Cf. the Parvati-Parinaya परुषस्तपोविशेषस्तव पुनरङ्ग शिररीषसुकुमारम् | व्यवसितमेतत्कठिनं पार्वति तद् दुष्करमिति प्रतिभाति, a fine Vyasian couplet. \"Harsh is this austerity of thy choosing; thy body again is tender as a Sirisha flower; yet iron firm is thy resolve, O Parvati; a hard thing truly this seemeth.\" Who is here the borrower, if loan there has been?\n\nपेलवं. The other readings कोमलं & पेशलं are less commendable & not supported by Mallinatha.\n\nपुनः on the other hand, however.\n\n---\n\nइति ध्रुवेच्छामनुशासती सुतां शशाक मेना न नियन्तुमुद्यमात् ।\nक ईप्सितार्थस्थिरनिश्चयं मनः पयश्च निम्नाभिमुखं प्रतीपयेत् ।।५।।\n\n5) Thus though she urged her, yet could not Mena rein in her daughter's fixed purpose from action; for who can resist a mind steadfastly resolved on the object of its desire or a downward-moving stream?\n\nध्रुवेच्छाम्. The reading व्रतेच्छाम् is weak & श्रुतेच्छाम् absolutely without force. Neither is noticed by Mallinatha. The point of course is the unspeakable fixity of her resolve and not its object.\n\nनियन्तुमुद्यमात्. The delicate etymological assonance is a fine survival of one of Kalidasa's favourite rhetorical artifices.\n\nउद्यमात्. This word is variously taken in various contexts. S here renders by उत्साह, Apte by \"fixed resolve\" and Deshpande by \"undertaking\", whereas Mallinatha consistently renders by उद्योग. It is as well therefore to fix its exact meaning. The root यम् meaning to put under a strain with उद् \"up\" in an intensive, implies the strain put on the faculties in preparing for or making a great effort. It means therefore \"active effort or endeavour\" or else \"active preparation\". In this latter sense Apte quotes गन्तुमुद्यमो विहितः = Preparations to go were taken <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> for. In sloka 3 the dative तपसे having the same force as an infinitive leads us to prefer this meaning; \"effort towards austerity\" has no meaning [in] the context. I think in this sloka, it has as Mallinatha perceived, the same sense; Uma is still in the stage of preparation, & is not yet even ready to ask her father's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span>. Effort or endeavour would therefore be obviously out of place.<span class='page-number' id='s-298' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.298]</span> Now these are the only two ascertained senses of उद्यम. The sense of उत्साह or undertaking cannot be established and is not recognised by Apte. That of \"perseverance\", \"fixed resolve\" given to it by Kv in sloka 3 and by Apte here, seems to me equally without authority; I believe there is no passage in which उद्यमः occurs where it cannot be rendered by \"effort, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span>\" or preparation. Here moreover Mr Apte is obviously wrong, for the sense of \"fixed resolve\" has already been given by ध्रुवेच्छाम् and Kalidasa is never tautologous, never expresses the same thing twice over in a line. Perhaps he intends us to take his next quotation, from the Punchatuntra, in this sense उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः | But the opposite to मनोरथाः <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> is obviously not \"perseverance\" but \"effort\". \"It is by active effort and not by mere desires that accomplishment is reached.\" For a more detailed discussion of this subject see Excursus.[^2]\n\n[^2]: *This Excursus was not written or has not survived.—Ed.*\n\nपयश्च निम्नाभिमुखं water which has set its face towards descent पयः the general is here obviously used for प्रवाह the particular.\n\nप्रतीपयेत्. The commentaries take in the sense of \"turn back\", most definitely expressed by S, पश्चात्कश्चालयेत्. Mallinatha recognising that प्रतीपयेत् primarily means प्रतिकूलयेत् oppose, gives that sense & deduces from it प्रतिनिवर्तयेत् . Apte also quotes this passage to establish this sense of प्रतीपय. This of course is taking प्रतीपय = प्रतीपं कृ, प्रतीप being \"reverse, inverted\", e.g. 2.25 अम्भसामोघसंरोधः प्रतीपगमनादिव (अनुमीयते) | But प्रतीप also & primarily means adverse, hostile, so प्रतीपयति = प्रतीपः भवति be hostile to, oppose. It might possibly be taken in this sense here, without Mallinatha's deduction of \"turn back\"; the general <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the proposition justifying the more general sense.\n\n---\n\nकदाचिदासन्नसखीमुखेन सा मनोरथज्ञं पितरं मनस्विनी ।\nअयाचतारण्यनिवासमात्मनः फलोदयान्ताय तपःसमाधये ।।६।।\n\n6) Once she, the clear-minded, by the mouth of her personal friend begged of her father not ignorant of her longing that<span class='page-number' id='s-299' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.299]</span> she might dwell in the forests there to practise austerity and meditation until she saw fruit of her desire.\n\nकदाचिद् ... मनस्विनी once, at a certain time. कस्मिंश्चित्काले गते सति says V [*Vatsavyasa*]. It certainly means that; but that is not the precise shade of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> used by Kalidasa. कदाचिद् means \"at a certain time\", and its full force is brought out by मनस्विनी. The commentators are all astray in their rendering of this word, even Mallinatha rendering स्थिरचिता while Avachuri & C give मानिनी & साभिमाना, meaning proud, ambitious which is ludicrously wrong. मनस्वी can mean nothing but wise, intellectual, a thinker. The wisdom of Parvati lay in her choice of a time, hence Kalidasa's use of कदाचिद् which at first seems awkward & vague, but in relation to मनस्विनी takes force & body. The wisdom is farther specified by मनोरथज्ञं. The commentators take this as meaning \"knowing of her desire to marry Hara\", but this was very old news to Himalaya & there would be no point in recording his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> here; V's explanation \"for he who does not know the desire, does not give his consent\", is inexpressibly feeble. मनोरथ means here not her desire for Siva, but her desire to practise austerity as a means of winning Siva. Parvati wisely waited till the news of this intention had travelled to her father and he had had time to get accustomed to it and think it over. If she had hastily sprung it on him, his tenderness for her might have led him to join Mena in forbidding the step, which would have been fatal to her plans.\n\nआसन्नसखी . The Avachuri absurdly says तटस्थ, a mediating friend. Mallinatha is obviously right आप्तसखी . A friend who is always near one, i.e. a personal or intimate friend. Cf. आसन्नपरिचारिका.\n\nमुख. Mallinatha takes = उपाय by means of her friend & quotes Vishwa मुखं निःसरणे वक्त्रे प्रारम्भोपाययोरपि i.e. मुख means \"issue\", \"face, mouth\", also \"beginning\" and \"means, expedient\". I do not see why we should not take the ordinary sense here.\n\nतपःसमाधये. Mallinatha says तपोनियमार्थम्, and the commentators generally follow him. Apte also takes समाधि = penance<span class='page-number' id='s-300' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.300]</span> (meaning, of course, austerity), religious obligation (?), <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> to penance. I fail to see why we should foist this sense on समाधिः. There is none of the passages quoted by Apte in support of it which cannot be as well or better translated by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span>. Here we may take as a dwandwa compound \"austerity & concentration\" or even better in accordance with sloka 2 तपोभिः समाधये concentration to be gained by austerities. See Excursus.\n\nअयाचत only Atmane having the middle sense \"to ask for oneself\". Notice the skilful use of compounds in this verse getting its full value out of this element of the language, without overdoing it like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhavabhuti</span> & other late writers.\n\n---\n\nअथानुरुपाभिनिवेशतोषिणा कृताभ्यनुज्ञा गुरुणा गरीयसा ।\nप्रजासु पश्चात्प्रथितं तदाख्यया जगाम गौरीशिखरं शिखण्डिमत् ।।७।।\n\n7) Then by her graver parent permitted, for pleased was he at a passion so worthy of her, she went to the peacock-haunted peak of the White Mother, famed afterwards among the peoples by her name.\n\nअभिनिवेश is anything that takes possession of the mind or the nature, \"passion\", \"engrossing resolve\". The first seems to me more appropriate here.\n\nशिखण्डिमत्. V considers this merely an ornamental epithet, expressing the beauty of the hill; but ornamental epithets find little place in the कुमारसंभव . Mallinatha explains \"not full of wild beasts of prey\", which is forced & difficult to reconcile with विरोधिसत्वोज्झितपूर्वमत्सरं in sloka 17. The Avachuri is characteristically inane; it says \"Peacocks are without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> (सङ्ग = attachment to worldly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>), the sight of attachment breaks समाधि\"; I have reared peacocks myself and I can assure the reader that they have as much \"attachment\" as any other creature.\n\nI believe that this is a very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and delicate allusion to the destined fruit of Uma's journey & consummation of the poem, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of the कुमार, Skanda being always associated with the peacock. Kalidasa thus skilfully introduces a beautifying epithet without allowing it to be otiose.<span class='page-number' id='s-301' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.301]</span>\n\n---\n\nविमुच्य सा हारमहार्यनिश्चया विलोलयष्टिप्रविलुप्तचन्दनम् ।\nबबन्ध बालारुणबभ्रु बल्कलं पयोधरोत्सेधविशीर्णसंहति ।।८।।\n\n8) In her irremovable resolve she put off the necklace whose restless string had rubbed off the sandal smeared and fastened on the bark tawny red like the young dawn though ever her high-swelling breasts rent its firm compactness.\n\nविलोलयष्टि etc. The meaning conveyed is that the movements of the necklace had already rubbed off the sandal paste from her breasts which otherwise she would have had to refuse herself as being a piece of luxury incompatible with तपः. Some of the commentators take यष्टि as meaning \"her slender figure\"; \"the necklace which owing to the restlessness of her slender body had rubbed off the sandal-paste.\" But to take विलोलयष्टि = यष्टिविलोलता (चन्चलाङ्ग्तया A) is very awkward and in any case it is extremely doubtful whether यष्टिः by itself could mean अङ्गयष्टिः . I should therefore reject this rendering which as far as significance goes one might perhaps prefer. If we take यष्टि in this sense, it is better to adopt the reading अहार्यनिश्चयाविलोलयष्टिः, understand not विलोलयष्टिः with J [*Jinasamudrasuri*] for that would be merely an ornamental epithet, but अविलोलयष्टिः \"She put off her necklace, having rubbed off the sandal-paste, and her slender body forgot its swayings\" i.e. the amorous beauty of motion attributed by the Kalidasian poets to beautiful women. प्रविलुप्तचन्दनं will be in this rendering an adverbial compound. The reading however has little authority.\n\nबालारुणब्रभू . Mallinatha curiously translates अरुण by अर्क sun; but अरुण means \"dawn\" and not \"sun\"; moreover the young sun is not tawny red unless seen through mist.\n\nपयोधर [etc.] lit. \"whose compactness is rent by the loftiness of her breasts\". The Avachuri is even more amazingly foolish than usual on this line. It construes अहार्यनिश्चया by आहारं त्यक्त्वा \"abandoning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span>\", a rendering which makes one suspect the sanity of the commentator, and पयोधरोत्सेधविशीर्णसंति by मेघोदयेन विस्तारितः समवायो यस्य, the close composition of which is spread out by the rising of the clouds; perhaps an unequalled instance of perverted scholastic ingenuity, though Mallinatha's<span class='page-number' id='s-302' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.302]</span> interpretation of the Dingnagian stanza in the Meghadut runs & will not bear it close. It is needless to say that उत्सेध & विशीर्ण the strained meanings put on them and that even if they could, Kalidasa's fine taste in the choice of words would never have employed such out-of-the-way expressions; he would have said plainly उदय and विस्तीर्ण. The sense arrived at by these unnecessary violences is the most prosaic, pointless and inept possible.\n\n---\n\nयथा प्रसिद्धैर्मधुरं शिरोरुहैर्जटाभिरप्येबमभृत्तदाननम् ।\nन षट्पदश्रेणिभिरेव पङ्कजं सशैवलासङ्गमपि प्रकाशते ।।९।।\n\n9) Even as her face was sweet with its fair-adorned tresses, so was it even with the ascetic's tangled crown; not set with lines of bees alone the lotus has splendour but also coated with moss.\n\nप्रसिध्धैः.

The meaning of course is \"dressed & adorned\" as opposed to the neglected जटा. प्रसिध्धौ ख्यातभूषितौ (Amara) \" प्रसिद्ध means famous' or adorned'.\"\n\nन शट्पदश्रेणिभिरेव. एव = alone, in its limiting sense.\n\nNote the implied comparison, a favourite form in Sanscrit classic poetry.\n\n---\n\nप्रतिक्षणं सा कृतरोमविक्रियां व्रताय मौञ्जीं त्रिगुणां बभार याम् ।\nअकारि तत्पूर्वनिबद्धया तथा सरागमस्या रसनागुणास्पदम् ।।१०।।\n\n10) The triple-plaited girdle of rough grass she wore—for her vow she wore it though every moment it caused discomfort, now first tied on reddened the seat of her zone.\n\nकृतरोमविक्रिया . The turning of the hair on the body is used by the concrete Sanscrit for the sense of discomfort caused by the contact of anything rough & uncomfortable. The same symptom also denotes in other circumstances great sensuous delight.\n\nव्रताय, here व्रतार्थम् with a view to her vow, for the sake of her vow.\n\nअकारि the Passive aorist; notice this tendency of later Sanscrit towards passive constructions in past time, prevalent in prose (see the Punchatuntra passim) & breaking its way occasionally<span class='page-number' id='s-303' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.303]</span> into poetry.

Deshpande singularly supposes that this may mean formerly, i.e. always kept away from. Such a rendering, if possible, would be wholly out of place & meaningless. The difficulty as regards the first line is avoided by supposing it meant that her lip was naturally too red to need artificial colouring or that her maidens did the colouring for her. This is most jejune and artificial, nor has such a detail the slightest appropriateness in the context. As regards the ball it is explained that her hand was too tender to play with it!! This is not only jejune, it is laughable. Kalidasa could never have perpetrated such an absurd conceit. Even if there were no other objections the absence of a word indicating past time would dispose of the rendering; for निवर्तितः is the causal of वृत् with नि. Now the simple निवृतः means \"cessation from प्रवृति, i.e. from any habit of mind, practice or course of action; turning away from something it had been turned to\". निवर्तितः therefore obviously means \"caused to cease from, turned from\". It cannot possibly have the sense of \"never busied with\"; but means \"ceasing to be busy with\".

And to interpret \"She never used to colour her lips or play at ball and she now plucked kusha-grass and counted a rosary\" introduces such foreign matter, substitutes non-sequence for sequence and ruins the balanced Kalidasian structure of these stanzas. Such commenting falls well under<span class='page-number' id='s-304' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.304]</span> Mallinatha's vigorous censure that the Muse of Kalidasa swoons to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> under the weight of bad commentaries.\n\nThe poet's meaning is plain. Her hand no longer as before was employed in colouring her lip, she had put that away from her; neither did it play with the ball all reddened with the vermilion of her breast; for both the vermilion was banished from her breast and the ball from her hand; it was only used now to pluck kusha grass & count the rosary.\n\nस्तनाङ्गरागाद् .

It is obvious that she could not at the same time sleep sitting & sleep with her arm as a pillow; if we are to render निषेदुषी = उपविष्टा we must take with D following Mallinatha \"slept pillowed on her arm and sat on the bare ground\"; but this is not justified by the Sanscrit, the word being a participle & not as it then should be a finite tense like अशेत with or without च. Moreover the idea of sitting is foreign to the contrast between her former bed and her present, & therefore would not be introduced by Kalidasa. We must take निषद् in its primary sense of \"sink down\", \"recline\"; it implies entire recumbence & is opposed to परिवर्तन in the first line. \"She who was formerly restless on softest couches, now lay restfully on the hard bare ground.\"\n\nस्थण्डिले ... केवले . केवले means without any covering, not merely of grass as some have it, but of either grass or any sheet or coverlet.

In a striking but quite superficial manner these brief stanzas remind us of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> epigram in the most masterly hands: Mimnermus, Simonides; but their spirit and the law of their internal structure relate them rather to a type of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> peculiarly Asiatic.\n\nClassical Sanscrit literature, as a whole, is governed by an inner stress of spirit which urges it to a sort of lucid density of literary structure; in style a careful blending of curious richness with concentrated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and directness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, in thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> a crowded vividness and pregnant lucidity.

If a picture, it might be crowded with felicitous detail; if a thought, with pregnant suggestion; if a sentiment, with happy shades<span class='page-number' id='s-368' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.368]</span> of feeling; but the whole must be perfectly lucid and firm in its unity. If these qualities were successfully achieved, the result was a Subhashita, a thing well said and therefore memorable. Sometimes the Subhashita clarified into a simple epigram, sometimes it overcharged itself with curious felicities, but the true type lay between the extremes. Similar tendencies are noticeable in the best Indian artwork in ivory, wood and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metal</span>, and even enter its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span> with that spirit which passed into the Moguls and informing new shapes of loveliness created the Taj. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> a small Hindu temple is a visible Subhashita in stone. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> of the classical times the tendency was so strong that poems of considerable magnitude like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kalidasa</span>'s Race of Raghou or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Magha</span>'s Slaying of Shishupala are for the most part built up of stanzas on this model; in others there are whole passages which are merely a succession of Subhashitas, so that the account of a battle or a city scene affects us like a picture gallery and a great speech moves past in a pomp of high-crested armoured thoughts. A successful Subhashita of the highest type is for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the world as if some great ironclad sailing solitary on the limitless ocean were to turn its arc-light on a passing object; in the brilliant concentrated flood of lustre a small vessel is revealed; we see the masts, funnel, rails, decks, the guns in their positions, men standing on the deck, an officer on the bridge, every detail clear in the strange artificial lustre; next moment the light is shut off and the scene, relapsing into darkness, is yet left bitten in on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>. There is the same instantaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of vision, the same carefully-created luminousness and crowded lucidity of separate detail in the clear-cut unity of the picture.\n\nBut the Subhashita is not peculiar to India, it pervades <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span>. The most characteristic verse of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> is confined to this style; it seems to have overmastered Arabian poetry; that it is common in Persian the Rubaiyat of Omar and the writings of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hafiz</span> and Sadi would appear to indicate. In India itself we find the basis of the style in some of the Upanishads, although the structure there is more flexible and flowing, not yet trained to the armoured compactness of classic diction. Subsequently the only class of writing which the spirit of the Subhashita did<span class='page-number' id='s-369' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.369]</span> not invade, was that great mass of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> and religious literature which made its appeal to the many and not to the cultured few. In the Mahabharat, Ramayan and the Puranas we have the grand natural stream of Hindu poetry flowing abundantly through plain and valley, not embanked and bunded by the engineer.\n\nKalidasa and Bhartrihari are the two mightiest masters of the characteristic classical style as it was at its best, before it degenerated into over-curiosity. Tradition tells us they were contemporaries. It is even said that Bhartrihari was an elder brother of Vikramaditya, Kalidasa's patron,—not of course Harsha of the sixth century to whom <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European scholarship</span> has transferred the distinction, but the half-mythical founder of Malava power in the first century before <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span>. To account for the succession of a younger brother, the old and common story of the fruit that changed hands till it returned disastrously to the first giver, is saddled on the great moralist. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> Bhartrihari understood that his beloved wife was unfaithful to him, and, overwhelmed by the shock, fell wholly under the influence of Vairagya, abandoned his crown to Vikrama and sought the forest in the garb of an anchorite. The second stanza of the Century of Morals commemorates the unhappy discovery. But the epigram has no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> in that place and it is doubtful whether it has a personal application; the story itself is an evident <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span>. On the other hand the notion of some European scholars that Bhartrihari was a mere compiler of other people's Subhashitas, is not much better inspired. Undoubtedly, spurious verses were introduced and a few bear the mark of their extraneous origin; but I think no one who has acquired a feeling for Sanscrit style or is readily responsive to the subtle spirit in poetry can fail to perceive that the majority are by one master-craftsman. The question is for those to decide who have learned to feel the shades of beauty and peculiarities of tinge in words (a quite different thing from shades of meaning and peculiarities of use) and to regard them not as verbal counters or grammatical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> but as living things. Without this subtle taste for words the finer personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of style, those which do not depend on general principles of structure, cannot be well-appreciated. There are collections<span class='page-number' id='s-370' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.370]</span> of Subhashitas in plenty, but the style of Bhartrihari is a distinct style and the personality of Bhartrihari is a distinct personality. There is nothing of that infinite variety of tone, note, personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span>—I do not refer to mere shiftings of standpoint and inconsistencies of opinion—which stamp a collection; there is one characteristic tone, a note strong and unmistakeable, the persistent self-repetition of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> manner. All is mint of a single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>.\n\nBhartrihari's Centuries are important to us as the finished expression of a thoroughly typical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aryan</span> personality in the most splendid epoch of Indian culture. The most splendid, not the best; for the vigorous culture mirrored in the epics has been left behind; the nobly pure, strong and humane <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> which produced Buddha gives way to a civilisation a little less humane, much less masculine, infinitely less pure, yet richer, more variously coloured, more delightful to the taste and senses; the millennium of philosophy and heroism yields to the millennium of luxury and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>. Of the new civilisation Kalidasa is the perfect and many-sided representative; he had the receptive, alchemistic imagination of the great world-poets, Shakespeare, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> and Valmekie, and everything that was in his world he received into that alembic with a deep creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and transmuted into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and sounds of magical beauty. Bhartrihari's was a narrower mind and intenser personality. He represents his age in those aspects which powerfully touched his own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, but to others, not having catholicity of moral temper, he could not respond. He was evidently a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span>; for all his poetry breathes that proud, grandiose, arrogantly noble spirit of the old magnanimous Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span>, extreme in its self-assertion, equally extreme in its self-abnegation, which made the ancient Hindu people one of the three or four great peoples of antiquity. The savour of the Kshatriya spirit in Bhartrihari is of the most personal, intimate kind, not the purely poetic and appreciative delight of Kalidasa. It is with him grain of character, not mere mental impression. It expresses itself even in his Vairagya by the fiery and ardent, almost fierce spirit which inspires his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>asceticism</span>,—how different from the fine quietism of the Brahmin!<span class='page-number' id='s-371' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.371]</span> But the Century of World-disgust, although it contains some of his best poetry, is not to us his most characteristic and interesting work; we find that rather in the Century of Morals.\n\nThis Century is an admirable, if incomplete poetic rendering of the great stock of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span> which our old writers summarised in the one word Arya,—Aryan, noble. The word Arya has been thought to correspond very closely to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> idea of a gentleman,—inaccurately, for its conception is larger and more profound in moral content. Arya and Anarya correspond in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of ideas partly to the totality indicated by the word, *gentleman*, and its opposite, partly to the conceptions knightly and unknightly, partly to the qualities suggested in an English mind by the expressions English and unEnglish as applied to conduct. The Aryan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is he who observes in spirit and letter the received code of a national morality which included the higher niceties of etiquette, the bold and chivalrous temper of a knightly and martial aristocracy, the general obligations of truth, honour and high feeling, and, crowning all, such great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> of the Vedic and Buddhistic religion,—sweetness, forbearance, forgiveness, charity, self-conquest, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, self-forgetfulness, self-immolation—as had entered deeply into the national imagination.\n\nThe ideas of the Century of Morals are not in themselves extraordinary, nor does Bhartrihari, though he had a full share of the fine culture of his age, appear to have risen in intellectual originality <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the average level; it is the personality which appears in the Centuries that is striking. Bhartrihari is, as Matthew <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arnold</span> would have said, in the grand style. He has the true heroic turn of mind and turn of speech; he breathes a large and puissant atmosphere. High-spirited, high-minded, high of temper, keen in his sympathies, admiring courage, firmness and daring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> above all things, thrilling to impulses of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, kindliness and self-sacrifice in spite of his rugged strength, dowered with a trenchant power of scorn and sombre irony, and occasionally of stern invective, but sweetening this masculine severity of character with varied culture and the old high Indian worship of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, goodness and wisdom, such is the man who emerges from the one hundred and odd verses of<span class='page-number' id='s-372' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.372]</span> the Shataka. The milder and more feminine shades of the Aryan ideal he does not so clearly typify. We have often occasion to ask ourselves, What manner of men did the old Aryan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span>, uniting with the new Helleno-Asiatic culture, succeed in producing? Bhartrihari is at least one type of its products.\n\nAnd yet in the end a doubt breaks in. Was he altogether of his age? Was he not born in an alien time and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> day? He would have been better at home, one fancies, with the more masculine temper depicted in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span>. Certainly he ended in disgust and fled for refuge to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> not wholly characteristic of his time. He had lived the life of courts, was perhaps an official of high standing and seems to have experienced fully the affronts, uncertainties, distastes to which such a career has always been exposed. From the beginning stray utterances point to a growing dissatisfaction and in the end there comes the poignant cry of a thwarted life. When we read the Century of Passion, we seem to come near the root of his malady. As in the earlier Century he has subdued to the law of poetical form the ethical aspects of life, so now will he deal with the delight of the senses; but how little of real delight there is in this misnamed Century of Passion! Bhartrihari is no real lover, certainly; but neither is he a genuine voluptuary. Of that keen-edged honey-laden delight in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of the senses and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> which thrills through every line of Kalidasa's Cloud, there is no faintest trace. Urged into voluptuous experience by fashion and habit, this high and stern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> had no real vocation for the life of the senses; in this respect, and who shall say in how many others, he was out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with the moral atmosphere of his times, and at last turned from it all to cry aloud the holy name of Shiva by the waters of the pure and ancient river, the river Ganges, while he waited impatiently for the great release.... But this too was not his vocation. He had too much defiance, fire, self-will for the ascetic. To have fallen in the forefront of ancient heroic battle or to have consummated himself in some grandiose act of self-sacrifice, this would have been his life's fitting fulfilment, the true end of Bhartrihari.<span class='page-number' id='s-373' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.373]</span> The edition followed in the main is that of Mr. Telang in the Bombay Sanscrit Series. The accepted order of the verses, although it admits a few gross <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> and misplacements, has nevertheless been preserved. All the Miscellaneous Epigrams at the end have been omitted from the rendering;[^1] and three others, the 90th which has crept in from the Shakuntala of Kalidasa, the 104th which is an inferior version of an earlier epigram and the 18th which has come down to us in a hopelessly corrupt condition. The 27th epigram occurs in the Mudrarakshasa but has been admitted as it is entirely in Bhartrihari's spirit and manner and may have been copied into the play. Some other verses which do not bear internal evidence of Bhartrihari's authorship in their style and spirit, have yet been given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n[^1]: *Sri Aurobindo included a series of \"Miscellaneous Verses\" in the final translation.—Ed.*\n\nThe principle of translation followed has been to preserve faithfully the thought, spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> of the original, but otherwise to take the full licence of a poetical rendering. In translation from one European tongue into another a careful literalness may not be out of place, for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>, sentence structure and turns of thought of European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> are not very dissimilar; they belong to one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span>. But the gulf between Sanscrit and English in these respects is very wide, and any attempt at close verbal rendering would be disastrous. I have made no attempt to render the distinctive features of Bhartrihari's style; on the contrary I have accepted the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of substituting for the severity & compact massiveness of Sanscrit diction which must necessarily vanish in translation, the greater richness & colour preferred by the English tongue. Nor have I attempted to preserve the peculiar qualities of the Subhashita; Bhartrihari's often crowded couplets and quatrains have been perforce dissolved into a looser and freer style and in the process have sometimes expanded to considerable dimensions. Lines of cunningly wrought gold have had to be beaten out into some tenuity. Otherwise the finer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> & suggestions of the<span class='page-number' id='s-374' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.374]</span> original would have been lost or blurred. I hold it more pardonable in poetical translation to unstring the language than to dwarf the spirit and mutilate the thought. For in poetry it is not the verbal substance that we seek from the report or rendering of foreign masterpieces; we desire rather the spiritual substance, the soul of the poet & the soul of his poetry. We cannot hear the sounds & rhythms loved & admired by his countrymen and contemporaries; but we ask for as many as we can recover of the responses & echoes which that ancient <span class='underline'

their midst he sat.<span class='page-number' id='s-380' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.380]</span>\n\n6) By thee, O pure of blemish,

What thou, O long of life, hast distinguished decisively in this book and in that to be utterly the best for men, we would have thee announce to us.\n\n10) For thou knowest, O cultured soul, that

first touch, but the waters of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> stream only after the soul has

Being, for at every step sweetness is added to sweetness for those who can feel its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223)

leisure vast have we to hear of the Lord.\n\n22) It is Providence then that has shown thee to us who desire to cross safe over the difficult Kali, destroyer of the purer <span class='underline'

Underneath, thick darkness; even at midday the light is dim and uncertain; a seat of terrific gloom. There the foot of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> never treads; there except the illimitable rustle of the leaves and the cry of wild beasts and birds, no sound is heard.\n\nIn this interminable, impenetrable wilderness of blind gloom, it is night.

The glare and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> of the sun lay very heavy on the village of Padchinha. The village was crowded with houses, yet there was not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> to be seen. Line upon line of shops in the bazaar, row upon row of booths in the mart, hundreds of earthen houses interspersed with stone mansions high and low in every quarter. But today <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> was silent. In the bazaar the shops are closed, and where the shopkeeper has fled no man can tell. It is market day today, but in the mart there is no buying and selling. It is the beggars' day but the beggars are not out. The weaver has shut up his loom and lies weeping in his house; the trader has forgotten his traffic and weeps with his infant in his lap; the givers have left <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> and the teachers closed their schools; the very infant, it would seem, has no longer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> to cry aloud.

In that crowded desolation of houses <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> huge building whose great fluted pillars could be seen from afar, rose glorious as the peak of a hill. And yet where was the glory? The doors were shut, the house empty of the concourse of men, hushed and voiceless, difficult even to the entry of the wind. In a room within this dwelling where even noon was a darkness, in that darkness, like a pair of lilies flowering in the midnight, a wedded couple sat in thought. Straight in front of them stood Famine.\n\nThe harvest of the year 1174 had been poor, consequently in the year 1175 rice was a little dear; the people suffered, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> exacted its revenues to the last fraction of a farthing.

Suddenly in the month of Aswin Heaven turned away its face. In Aswin and Kartik not a drop of rain fell; the grain in the fields withered and turned to straw as it stood. Wherever an ear or two flourished, the officials bought it for the troops. The people no longer had anything to eat. First they stinted themselves of one meal in the day, then even from their single meal they rose with half-filled stomachs, next the two meal-times became two fasts. The little harvest reaped in Chaitra was not enough to fill the hungry mouths. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomed</span> Reza Khan, who was in charge of the revenues, thought fit to show himself off as a loyal servant and immediately enhanced the taxes by ten per cent.

They began to fast. Next they fell into the clutch of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span>. The cow was sold, plough and yoke were sold, the seed-rice was eaten, hearth and home were sold, land and goods were sold. Next they began to sell their girls. After that they began to sell their boys. After that they began to sell their wives. Next girl, boy, or wife,—who would buy? Purchasers there were none, only sellers. For want of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> men began to eat the leaves of trees, they began to eat grass, they began to eat weeds.

The virulence of smallpox was especially great. In every house men began to perish of the disease. There was none to give water to his fellow, none who would touch him, none to treat the sick.

In this time of crowding afflictions his relatives, friends, servants, maidservants had all been seized by disease and gone from him. Some had died, some had fled. In that once peopled household there was only himself, his wife and one infant girl. This was the couple of whom I spoke.\n\nThe wife, Kalyani, gave up thinking and went to the cowshed to milk the cow; then she warmed the milk, fed her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> and went again to give the cow its grass and water. When she returned from her task Mohendra said, \"How long can we go on in this way?\"\n\n\"Not long;\" answered Kalyani, \"as long as we can. So long as possible I will keep things going, afterwards you and the girl can go to the town.\"\n\n*Mohendra*. \"If we have to go to the town at the end, why should I inflict all this trouble on you at all? Come, let us go at once.\"\n\nAfter much arguing and contention between husband and wife, Kalyani said, \"Will there be any particular advantage in going to the town?\"\n\n*Mohendra*. \"Very possibly that place too is as empty of men and empty of means of subsistence as we are here.\"\n\n*Kalyani*. \"If you go to Murshidabad, Cassimbazar or Calcutta, you may save your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. It is in every way best to leave this place.\"\n\nMohendra answered, \"This house has been full for many years of the gathered wealth of generations. All this will be looted by thieves!\"\n\n*Kalyani*. \"If thieves come to loot it, shall we two be able to protect the treasure? If life is not saved who will be there to enjoy? Come, let us shut up the whole place this moment and go. If we survive, we can come back and enjoy what remains.\"\n\n\"Will you be able to do the journey on foot?\" asked Mohendra. \"The palanquin-bearers are all dead. As for cart or carriage, where there are bullocks there is no driver and where there is a driver there are no bullocks.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-475' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.475]</span>\n\n*Kalyani*. \"Oh, I shall be able to walk, do not fear.\"\n\nIn her heart she thought, even if she fell and died on the way, these two at least would be saved.\n\nThe next day at dawn the two took some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> with them, locked up room and door, let loose the cattle, took the child in their arms and set out for the capital. At the time of starting Mohendra said, \"The road is very difficult, at every step dacoits and highwaymen are hovering about, it is not well to go empty-handed.\" So saying Mohendra returned to the house and took from it musket, shot, and powder.\n\nWhen she saw the weapon, Kalyani said, \"Since you have remembered to take arms with you, hold Sukumari for a moment and I too will bring a weapon with me.\" With the words she put her daughter into Mohendra's arms and in her turn entered the house.\n\nMohendra called after her, \"Why, what weapon can you take with you?\"\n\nAs she came, Kalyani hid a small casket of poison in her dress. Fearing what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> might befall her in these days of misfortune, she had already procured and kept the poison with her.\n\nIt was the month of Jyaistha, a savage heat, the earth as if aflame, the wind scattering fire, the sky like a canopy of heated copper, the dust of the road like sparks of fire. Kalyani began to perspire profusely. Now resting under the shade of a babla-tree, now sitting in the shelter of a date-palm, drinking the muddy water of dried ponds, with great difficulty she journeyed forward. The girl was in Mohendra's arms and sometimes he fanned her with his robe. Once the two refreshed themselves, seated under the boughs of a creeper-covered tree flowering with odorous blooms and dark-hued with dense shade-giving foliage. Mohendra wondered to see Kalyani's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span> under <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span>. He drenched his robe with water from a neighbouring pool and sprinkled it on his and Kalyani's face, forehead, hands and feet.\n\nKalyani was a little cooled and refreshed, but both of them were distressed with great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span>. That could be borne, but the hunger and thirst of their child could not be endured, so they<span class='page-number' id='s-476' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.476]</span> resumed their march. Swimming through those waves of fire they arrived before evening at an inn. Mohendra had cherished a great hope that on reaching the inn he would be able to give cool water to his wife and child to drink and food to save their lives. But he met with a great disappointment. There was not a man in the inn. Big rooms were lying empty, the men had all fled. Mohendra after looking about the place made his wife and daughter lie down in one of the rooms. He began to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> from outside in a loud voice, but got no answer. Then Mohendra said to Kalyani, \"Will you have a little courage and stay here alone?

She thought of shutting all the doors and sitting in the security of the closed house. But not a single door had either panel or bolt. As she was thus gazing in every direction suddenly something in the doorway that faced her caught her eye, something like a shadow. It seemed to her to have the shape of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and yet not to be human. Something utterly dried up and withered, something like a very black, a naked and terrifying human shape had come and was standing at the door. After a little while the shadow seemed to lift a hand,—with the long withered finger of a long withered hand, all skin and bone, it seemed to make a motion of summons to someone outside. Kalyani's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> dried up in her with fear. Then just such another shadow, withered, black, tall, naked, came and stood by the side of the first.

Then they began to debate what to do with them, for what ornaments Kalyani had with her were already in their possession. One <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> was very busy with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> of this booty. But when the ornaments had been divided, one of the robbers said, \"What are we to do with gold and silver?

Gradually high words began to be exchanged, abuse flowed freely, a fight became imminent. Everyone in a rage pelted the leader with his whole allotment of ornaments. He also struck one or two and this brought all of them upon him striking at him in a general assault. The robber captain was emaciated and ill with starvation, one or two blows laid him prostrate and lifeless. Then one in that hungry, wrathful, excited, maddened troop of plunderers cried out, \"We have eaten the flesh of dogs and jackals and now we are racked with hunger; come, friends, let us feast today on this rascal.\" Then all began to shout aloud \"Glory to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kali</span>!

One of them set about lighting a fire to roast the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of the leader. He gathered dried creepers, wood and grass, struck flint and iron and set light to the collected fuel. As the fire burned up a little, the dark green foliage of the trees that were neighbours to the spot, mango, lemon, jackfruit and palm, tamarind and date, were lit up faintly with the flames. Here the leaves seemed ablaze, there the grass brightened in the light; in some places the darkness only became more crass and deep. When the fire was ready, one began to drag the corpse by the leg and was about to throw it on the fire, but another intervened and said \"Drop it! stop, stop! if it is on the grand meat that we must keep ourselves alive today, then why the tough and juiceless flesh of this old fellow? We shall eat what we have looted and brought with us today. Come along, there is that tender girl, let us roast and eat her.\" Another said \"Roast anything you like, my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> fellow, but roast it; I can stand this hunger no longer.\" Then all gazed greedily towards the place where Kalyani and her daughter had lain. They saw the place empty; neither child nor mother was there. Kalyani had seen her opportunity when the robbers were disputing, taken her daughter into her arms, put the child's mouth to her breast and fled into the wood. Aware of the escape of their prey, the ghostlike ruffian crew ran in every direction with a cry of \"Kill, kill\". In certain conditions man is no better than a ferocious wild beast.<span class='page-number' id='s-481' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.481]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter IV","txt":"The darkness of the wood was very deep and Kalyani could not find her way. In the thickly-woven entanglement of trees, creepers and thorns there was no path at the best of times and on that there came this impenetrable darkness.

The thorns pierced the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>'s skin and she cried from time to time; and at that the shouts of the pursuing robbers rose higher. In this way with torn and bleeding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, Kalyani made far progress into the woodland. After a little while the moon rose.

The moon, as it mounted into the sky, shed its light on the woodland tops and the darkness within was suffused with it. The darkness brightened, and here and there, through gaps, the outer luminousness found its way inside and peeped into the thickets.

Kalyani too with her child hid herself farther and farther in where the shadows retreated. And now the robbers shouted higher and began to come running from all sides, and the child in her terror wept louder. Kalyani then gave up the struggle and made no farther attempt to escape. She sat down with the girl on her lap on a grassy thornless spot at the foot of a great tree and called repeatedly \"Where <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> Thou?

In the half-lustrous moonbeams suffused and shadowed with the darkness of the forest, she saw in front of her that white-bodied, white-haired, white-bearded, white-robed image of a sage. Dreamily all her consciousness centred on the vision. Kalyani thought to bow down to it, but she could not perform the salutation; even as she bent her head, all consciousness left her and she lay fallen supine on the ground.<span class='page-number' id='s-483' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.483]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter V","txt":"In A huge tract of ground in the forest there was a great monastery engirt with ruined masses of stone.

He replied with a blessing and brought out from another room a sweet-smelling earthen pot in which he warmed some milk at the blazing fire. When the milk was warm he gave it to Kalyani and said, \"My child, give some to your daughter to drink and then drink some yourself, afterwards you can talk.\" Kalyani, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> in her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, began to administer the milk to her daughter.

Kalyani did not indeed utter her husband's name,—she could not; but the other information the ascetic received about him was sufficient for him to understand. He asked her, \"Then you are Mohendra Singha's wife?\" Kalyani, in silence and with bowed head, began to heap wood on the fire at which the milk had been warmed. Then the ascetic said, \"Do what I tell you, drink the milk; I am bringing you news of your husband. Unless you drink the milk, I will not go.\" Kalyani asked, \"Is there a little water anywhere here?\" The ascetic pointed to a jar of water. Kalyani made a cup of her hands, the ascetic filled it with water; then Kalyani, approaching her hands with the water in them to the ascetic's feet, said \"Please put the dust of your feet<span class='page-number' id='s-485' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.485]</span> in the water.\" When the ascetic had touched the water with his foot, Kalyani drank it and said, \"I have drunk nectar of the gods, do not tell me to eat or drink anything else; until I have news of my husband I will take nothing else.\" The ascetic answered, \"Abide without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> in this temple.

It was not the full moon and its brilliance was not so keen. An uncertain light, confused with shadowy hints of darkness, lay over an open common of immense extent, the two extremities of which could not be seen in that pale lustre. This plain affected the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> like something illimitable and desert, a very abode of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>. Through it there ran the road between Murshidabad and Calcutta.\n\nOn the road-side was a small hill which bore upon it a goodly number of mango-trees. The tree-tops glimmered and trembled with a sibilant rustle in the moonlight, and their shadows too, black upon the blackness of the rocks, shook and quivered. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> climbed to the top of the hill and there in rigid silence listened, but for what he listened, it is not easy to say; for, in that great plain that seemed as vast as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span>, there was not a sound except the murmurous rustle of the trees. At <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> spot there is a great jungle near the foot of the hill,—the hill above, the high road below, the jungle between. I do not know what sound met his ear from the jungle, but it was in that direction the ascetic went. Entering into the denseness of the growth he saw in the forest, under the darkness of the branches at the foot of long rows of trees, men sitting,—men tall of stature, black of hue, armed; their burnished weapons glittered fierily in the moonlight where it fell through gaps in the woodland leafage. Two hundred such armed men were sitting there, not one uttering a single word. The ascetic went slowly into their midst and made some signal, but not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> rose, none spoke, none made a sound. He passed in front of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, looking at each as he went, scanning every face in the gloom, as if he were seeking someone he could not find.

The ascetic took him to a distance and they stood and talked apart. The man was young; his handsome face wore a thick black moustache and beard; his frame was full of strength; his whole presence <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and attractive. He wore an ochre-coloured robe and on all his limbs the fairness and sweetness of sandal was smeared. The Brahmacharin said to him, \"Bhavananda, have you any news of Mohendra Singha?\"\n\nBhavananda answered, \"Mohendra Singha and his wife and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> left their house today; on the way, at the inn—\"\n\nAt this point the ascetic interrupted him, \"I know what happened at the inn.

And who is not a dacoit nowadays? Today we also have looted and eaten. Two maunds of rice belonging to the Chief of Police were on its way; we took and consecrated it to a devotee's dinner.\"\n\nThe ascetic laughed and said, \"I have rescued his wife and child from the thieves.

After journeying for some distance he saw in the road a number of bullock-carts surrounded by a great company of sepoys.\n\nIn the Bengali year 1175 the province of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> had not become subject to British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> were then the revenue officials of Bengal. They collected the taxes due to the treasury, but up to that time they had not taken upon themselves the burden of protecting the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and property of the Bengali people. The burden they had accepted was to take the country's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span>; the responsibility of protecting life and property lay upon that despicable traitor and disgrace to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, Mirzafar. Mirzafar was incapable of protecting even himself; it was not likely that he would or could protect the people of Bengal. Mirzafar took opium and slept; the English raked in the rupees and wrote despatches; as for the people of Bengal they wept and went to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span>.\n\nThe taxes of the province were therefore the due of the English, but the burden of administration was on the Nawab. Wherever the English themselves collected the taxes due to them, they had appointed a collector, but the revenue collected went to Calcutta. People might die of starvation, but the collection of their monies did not stop for a moment. However, very much could not be collected: for if Mother Earth does not yield wealth, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> can create wealth out of nothing. Be that as it may, the little that could be collected, had been made into cartloads and was on its way to the Company's treasury at Calcutta in charge of a military escort. At this time there was great danger from dacoits,<span class='page-number' id='s-489' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.489]</span> so fifty armed sepoys marched with fixed bayonets, ranked before and behind the carts. Their captain was an English soldier who went on horseback in the rear of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. On account of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> the sepoys did not march by day but only by night. As they marched, Mohendra's progress was stopped by the treasure carts and this military array. Mohendra, seeing his way barred by sepoys and carts, stood at the side of the road; but as the sepoys still jostled him in passing, holding this to be no fit time for debate, he went and stood at the edge of the jungle by the road.\n\nThen a sepoy said in Hindustani, \"See, there's a dacoit making off.\" The sight of the gun in Mohendra's hand confirmed this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>. He went for Mohendra, caught hold of his neck and, with the salutation \"Rogue! thief!\" suddenly gave him a blow of the fist and wrested the gun from his hand. Mohendra, empty-handed, merely returned the blow. Needless to say, Mohendra was something more than a little angry, and the worthy sepoy reeled with the blow and went down stunned on the road. Upon that, three or four sepoys came up, took hold of Mohendra and, dragging him forcibly to the commander, told the Saheb, \"This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> has killed one of the sepoys.\" The Saheb was smoking and a little bewildered with strong drink; he replied, \"Catch hold of the rogue and marry him.\" The soldiers did not understand how they were to marry an armed highwayman, but in the hope that, with the passing of the intoxication, the Saheb would change his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>marriage</span> would not be forced on them, three or four sepoys bound Mohendra hand and foot with the halters of the cart bullocks and lifted him into the cart. Mohendra saw that it would be vain to use force against so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span>, and, even if he could effect his escape by force, what was the use? Mohendra was depressed and sorrowful with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> for his wife and child and had no desire for life. The sepoys bound Mohendra securely to the wheel of the cart. Then with a slow and heavy stride the escort proceeded on its march.<span class='page-number' id='s-490' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.490]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter VIII","txt":"Possessed of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>'s command, Bhavananda, softly crying the name of Hari, went in the direction of the inn where Mohendra had been sitting; for he thought it likely that there he would get a clue to Mohendra's whereabouts.\n\nAt that time the present roads made by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> were not in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to come to Calcutta from the district towns, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> had to travel by the marvellous roads laid down by the Mogul emperors. On his way from Padchinha to the town, Mohendra had been travelling from south to north, and it was therefore that he met the soldiers on the way. The direction Bhavananda had to take from the Hill of Palms towards the inn, was also from south to north; necessarily, he too on his way fell in with the sepoys in charge of the treasure. Like Mohendra, he stood aside to let them pass. Now, for one thing, the soldiers naturally believed that the dacoits would be sure to attempt the plunder of this despatch of treasure, and on that apprehension came the arrest of a dacoit in the very highway. When they saw Bhavananda too standing aside in the night-time, they inevitably concluded that here was another dacoit. Accordingly, they seized him on the spot.\n\nBhavananda smiled softly and said, \"Why so, my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> fellow?\"\n\n\"Rogue!\" answered a sepoy, \"you are a robber.\"\n\n\"You can very well see I am an ascetic wearing the yellow robe. Is this the appearance of a robber?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of rascally ascetics and Sannyasins who rob,\" retorted the sepoy, and he began to push and drag Bhavananda. Bhavananda's eyes flashed in the darkness, but he only said very humbly, \"Good <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>, let me know your commands.\"\n\nThe sepoy was pleased at Bhavananda's politeness and said, \"Here, rascal, take this load and carry it,\" and he clapped a<span class='page-number' id='s-491' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.491]</span> bundle on Bhavananda's head. Then another of the sepoys said to the first, \"No, he will run away; tie up the rascal on the cart where the other rogue is bound.\" Bhavananda grew curious to know who was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> they had bound; he threw away the bundle on his head and administered a slap on the cheek to the soldier who had put it there. In consequence, the sepoys bound Bhavananda, lifted him on to the cart and flung him down near Mohendra. Bhavananda at once recognised Mohendra Singha.\n\nThe sepoys again marched on, carelessly and with noise, and the creaking of the cartwheels recommenced. Then, softly and in a voice audible only to Mohendra, Bhavananda said, \"Mohendra Singha, I know you and am here to give you <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span>. There is no need for you to know just at present who I am. Do very carefully what I tell you. Put the rope that ties your hands on the wheel of the cart.\"\n\nMohendra, though astonished, carried out Bhavananda's suggestion without a word. Moving a little towards the cartwheel under cover of darkness, he placed the rope that tied his hands so as to just touch the wheel. The rope was gradually cut through by the friction of the wheel. Then he cut the rope on his feet by the same means. As soon as he was free of his bonds, by Bhavananda's advice he lay inert on the cart. Bhavananda also severed his bonds by the same device. Both lay utterly still and motionless.\n\nThe path of the soldiers took them precisely by the road where the Brahmacharin had stood in the highway near the jungle and gazed round him. As soon as they arrived near the hill, they saw under it, on the top of a mound, a man standing. Catching sight of his dark figure silhouetted against the moonlit azure sky, the havildar said, \"There is another of the rogues; catch him and bring here: he shall carry a load.\"\n\nAt that a soldier went to catch the man, but, though he saw the fellow coming to lay hold on him, the watcher stood firm; he did not stir. When the soldier laid hands on him, he said nothing. When he was brought as a prisoner to the havildar, even then he said nothing. The havildar ordered a load to be put on his head; a soldier put the load in place, he took it on his<span class='page-number' id='s-492' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.492]</span> head. Then the havildar turned away and started marching with the cart. At this moment a pistol shot rang suddenly out and the havildar, pierced through the head, fell on the road and breathed his last. A soldier shouted, \"This rascal has shot the havildar,\" and seized the luggage-bearer's hand. The bearer had still the pistol in his grasp. He threw the load from him and struck the soldier on the head with the butt of his pistol; the man's head broke and he dropped farther proceedings. Then with a cry of \"Hari! Hari! Hari!\" two hundred armed men surrounded the soldiery. The men were at that moment awaiting the arrival of their English captain, who, thinking the dacoits were on him, came swiftly up to the cart and gave the order to form a square; for an Englishman's intoxication vanishes at the touch of danger. The sepoys immediately formed into a square facing four ways and at a farther command of their captain lifted their guns in act to fire. At this critical moment someone wrested suddenly the Englishman's sword from his belt and with one blow severed his head from his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. With the rolling of the Englishman's head from his shoulders the unspoken command to fire was silenced for ever. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> looked and saw a man standing on the cart, sword in hand, shouting loud the cry of \"Hari, Hari\" and calling \"Kill, kill the soldiers.\" It was Bhavananda.\n\nThe sudden sight of their captain headless and the failure of any officer to give the command for defensive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> kept the soldiers for a few moments passive and appalled. The daring assailants took advantage of this opportunity to slay and wound <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span>, reach the carts and take possession of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> chests. The soldiers lost courage, accepted defeat and took to flight.\n\nThen the man who had stood on the mound and afterwards assumed the chief leadership of the attack, came to Bhavananda. After a mutual embrace Bhavananda said, \"Brother Jivananda, it was to good purpose that you took the vow of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span>.\" \"Bhavananda,\" replied Jivananda, \"justified be your name.\" Jivananda was charged with the office of arranging for the removal of the plundered treasure to its proper place and he swiftly departed with his following. Bhavananda alone remained standing on the field of action.<span class='page-number' id='s-493' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.493]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter IX","txt":"Mohendra had descended from the cart, wrested a weapon from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the sepoys and made ready to join in the fight. But at this moment it came home clearly to him that these men were robbers and the plunder of the treasure the object of their attack on the soldiery.

Then Bhavananda, having no other resource, began to sing to himself.\n\n>\"Mother, I bow to thee!\nRich with thy hurrying streams,\nBright with thy orchard gleams,\nCool with thy winds of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>,\nDark fields waving, Mother of might,\nMother free!\"\n\nThe song astonished Mohendra and he could understand nothing of it. Who might be this richly watered, richly fruited Mother, cool with delightful winds and dark with the harvests? \"What Mother?\" he asked.\n\nBhavananda without any answer continued his song.\n\n>\"Glory of moonlight <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>\nOver thy beaches and lordly streams;<span class='page-number' id='s-496' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.496]</span>\nClad in thy blossoming trees,\nMother, giver of ease,\nLaughing low and sweet!\nMother, I kiss thy feet,\nSpeaker sweet and low!\nMother, to thee I bow.\"\n\nMohendra said, \"That is the country, it is not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>.\"\n\nBhavananda replied, \"We recognize no other Mother. Mother and Motherland is more than heaven itself.' We say the motherland is our mother. We have neither mother nor father nor brother nor friend, wife nor son nor house nor home. We have her alone, the richly-watered, richly- fruited, cool with delightful winds, rich with harvests—\"\n\nThen Mohendra understood and said, \"Sing it again.\" Bhavananda sang once more.\n\n>Mother, I bow to thee!\nRich with thy hurrying streams,\nBright with thy orchard gleams,\nCool with thy winds of delight,\nDark fields waving, Mother of might,\nMother free.\nGlory of moonlight dreams\nOver thy beaches and lordly streams;\nClad in thy blossoming trees,\nMother, giver of ease,\nLaughing low and sweet!\nMother, I kiss thy feet,\nSpeaker sweet and low!\nMother, to thee I bow.\n\n>Who hath said thou <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> weak in thy lands,\nWhen the swords flash out in seventy million hands\nAnd seventy million voices roar\nThy dreadful name from shore to shore?\nWith many strengths who art mighty and stored,\nTo thee I <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span>, Mother and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>!<span class='page-number' id='s-497' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.497]</span>\nThou who savest, arise and save!\nTo her I cry who ever her foemen drave\nBack from plain and sea\nAnd shook herself free.\n\n>Thou art wisdom, thou art law,\nThou our heart, our soul, our breath,\nThou the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span>, the awe\nIn our hearts that conquers <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>.\nThine the strength that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> the arm,\nThine the beauty, thine the charm.\nEvery image made divine\nIn our temples is but thine.\nThou art <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Durga</span>, Lady and Queen,\nWith her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,\nThou art Lakshmi lotus-throned,\nAnd the Muse a hundred-toned.\n\n>Pure and perfect, without peer,\nMother, lend thine ear.\nRich with thy hurrying streams,\nBright with thy orchard gleams,\nDark of hue, O candid-fair\nIn thy soul, with jewelled hair\nAnd thy glorious smile divine,\nLoveliest of all earthly lands,\nShowering wealth from well-stored hands!\nMother, mother mine!\nMother sweet, I bow to thee,\nMother great and free!\n\nMohendra saw the robber as he sang shedding tears.

Look you, the snake crawls on the ground and is the lowest of living things, but put your foot on the snake's neck and even he will rise with lifted hood. Can nothing overthrow your patience then?

Unless we drive out these vice-besodden long-beards, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hinduism</span> of the Hindu is doomed.\"\n\n\"How will you drive them out?\" asked Mohendra.\n\n\"By blows.\"\n\n\"You will drive them out single-handed? With one slap, I suppose.\"\n\nThe robber sang:\n\n>\"Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,\nWhen the swords flash out in seventy million hands\nAnd seventy million voices roar\nThy dreadful name from shore to shore?\"\n\n\"But\" said Mohendra, \"I see you are alone.\"\n\n\"Why, just now you saw two hundred men.\"\n\n\"Are they all Children?\"\n\n\"They are all Children.\"\n\n\"How many more are there of them?\"\n\n\"Thousands like these, and by degrees there will be yet more!\"\n\n\"Even if there were ten or twenty thousand, will you be able with that number to take the throne from the Mussulman?\"\n\n\"What army had the English at Plassey?\"\n\n\"Can Englishmen and Bengalis be compared?\"\n\n\"Why not?

Greater physical strength will not make the bullet fly farther.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asked Mohendra, \"why is there such a difference between an Englishman and a Mussulman?\"\n\n\"Take this first;\" said Bhavananda, \"an Englishman will not run away even from the certainty of death. A Mussulman runs as soon as he perspires and roams in search of a glass of sherbet. Next take this, that the Englishman has tenacity; if he takes up a thing, he carries it through. \"Don't care\" is a Mussulman's motto.

You have to practise them.\"\n\n\"Do you practise them?\"\n\n\"Do you not see we are sannyasins? It is for this practice that we have made renunciation. When our work is done, when our training is complete, we shall again become householders. We also have wives and daughters.\"\n\n\"You have abandoned all those ties, but have you been able to overcome <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>?\"\n\n\"The Children are not allowed to speak falsely and I will not make a lying boast to you. Who has the strength to conquer Maya? When a man says, I have conquered Maya', either he never had any feeling or he is making a vain boast. We have not conquered Maya, we are only keeping our vow. Will you be one of the Children?\"\n\n\"Until I get news of my wife and daughter, I cannot say anything.\"\n\n\"Come then, you shall see your wife and child.\"\n\nThe two went on their way; and Bhavananda began again to sing Bande Mataram.\n\nMohendra had a good voice and was a little proficient in singing and fond of it; therefore he joined in the song, and found that as he sang the tears came into his eyes. Then Mohendra said, \"If I have not to abandon my wife and daughter, then initiate me into this vow.\"\n\n\"Whoever\" answered Bhavananda, \"takes this vow, must abandon wife and child. If you take this vow, you cannot be allowed to meet your wife and daughter. Suitable arrangements will be made for their protection, but until the vow is crowned with success, to look upon their faces is forbidden.\"\n\n\"I will not take your vow,\" answered Mohendra.<span class='page-number' id='s-501' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.501]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter XI","txt":"The day had dawned.

In that delightful dawn, that joyous forest, that \"Monastery of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span>\" Satyananda, seated on a deerskin, was performing his morning devotions. Jivananda sat near. It was at such a time that Bhavananda appeared with Mohendra Singha behind. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> without a word continued his devotions and no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> ventured to utter a sound.

Then Satyananda beckoned to Bhavananda and took him outside. What conversation took place between them, we do not know, but on the return of the two into the temple the ascetic, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> and laughter in his countenance, said to Mohendra, \"My son, I have been greatly distressed by your misfortune; it was only by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of the Friend of the poor and miserable that I was able to rescue your wife and daughter last night.\" The ascetic then told Mohendra the story of Kalyani's rescue and said at the end, \"Come, let me take you where they are.\"\n\nThe ascetic in front, Mohendra behind entered into the inner precincts of the temple. Mohendra beheld a wide and lofty hall. Even in this cheerful dawn, glad with the youth of the morning, when the neighbouring groves glittered in the sunshine as if set and studded with diamonds, in this great room there was almost a gloom as of night. Mohendra could not at first see what was in the room, but by gazing and gazing and still gazing he was able to distinguish a huge image of the four-armed Vishnu, bearing the shell, the discus, the club, the lotus-blossom, adorned with the jewel Coustoobh on his breast; in front the discus called Sudarshan, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beautiful</span>, seemed visibly to be whirling round.<span class='page-number' id='s-502' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.502]</span>\n\nTwo huge headless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> representing Madhu and Kaitabh were painted before the figure, as if bathed in their own blood. On the left stood Lakshmi with flowing locks garlanded with wreaths of hundred-petalled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lotuses</span>, as if distressed with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>. On the right stood Saraswati surrounded by books, musical instruments, the incarnate strains and symphonies of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>. On Vishnu's lap sat an image of enchanting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, lovelier than Lakshmi and Saraswati, more splendid with opulence and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> ship. The Gandharva and Kinnara and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and elf and giant paid her homage. The ascetic asked Mohendra in a voice of deep solemnity and awe, \"Can you see <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>?\" \"Yes\" replied Mohendra.\n\n\"Have you seen what is in the lap of Vishnu?\" asked the ascetic.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mohendra, \"who is she?\"\n\n\"It is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>.\"\n\n\"What mother?\"\n\n\"She whose children we are,\" replied the ascetic.\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"In time you will recognise her. Cry Hail to the Mother!' Now come, you shall see.\"\n\nThe ascetic took Mohendra into another room. There he saw an image of Jagaddhatri, Protectress of the world, wonderful, perfect, rich with every ornament. \"Who is she?\" asked Mohendra.\n\nThe Brahmacharin replied, \"The Mother as she was.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Mohendra.\n\n\"She trampled underfoot the elephants of the forest and all wild beasts and in the haunt of the wild beasts she erected her lotus throne. She was covered with every ornament, full of laughter and beauty. She was in hue like the young sun, splendid with all opulence and empire. Bow down to the Mother.\"\n\nMohendra saluted reverently the image of the Motherland as the protectress of the world. The Brahmacharin then showed him a dark underground passage and said, \"Come by this way.\" Mohendra with some alarm followed him. In a dark room in the bowels of the earth an insufficient light entered from some unperceived outlet. By that faint light he saw an image of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kali</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-503' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.503]</span>\n\nThe Brahmacharin said, \"Look on the Mother as she now is.\"\n\nMohendra said in fear, \"It is Kali.\"\n\n\"Yes, Kali enveloped in darkness, full of blackness and gloom. She is stripped of all, therefore naked. Today the whole country is a burial ground, therefore is the Mother garlanded with skulls. Her own God she tramples under her feet. Alas, my Mother!\"\n\nThe tears began to stream from the ascetic's eyes.\n\n\"Why,\" asked Mohendra, \"has she in her hands the club and the skull?\"\n\n\"We are the Children, we have only just given weapons into our Mother's hands. Cry Hail to the Mother!'\"\n\nMohendra said \"Bande Mataram\" and bowed down to Kali.\n\nThe ascetic said \"Come by this way\", and began to ascend another underground passage. Suddenly the rays of the morning sun shone in their eyes and from every side the sweet-voiced <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span> of birds shrilled in song. In a wide temple built in stone of marble they saw a beautifully fashioned image of the Ten-armed Goddess made in gold, laughing and radiant in the light of the early sun. The ascetic saluted the image and said, \"This is the Mother as she shall be. Her ten arms are extended towards the ten regions and they bear <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> imaged in her manifold weapons; her enemies are trampled under her feet and the lion on which her foot rests, is busy destroying the foe.

Yet in this time of famine, what other place can I find?\"\n\n\"Go out of the temple,\" said the ascetic, \"by the way by which you came here. At the door of the temple you will see your wife and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>.

Mohendra went forth by the way pointed out to him and saw Kalyani with her daughter sitting in the court of meeting.\n\nSatyananda on his side descended by another underground passage into a secret cellar under the earth. There Jivananda and Bhavananda sat counting rupees and arranging them in piles. In that room gold, silver, copper, diamonds, coral, pearls were arrayed in heaps. It was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> looted on the previous night they were arranging. Satyananda, as he entered the room, said, \"Jivananda, Mohendra will come to us.

That forest was inaccessible to ordinary men. Wherever there was a tree with fruit upon it, famishing men stripped it of what it bore, but none other than the Children had access to the fruit of the trees in this impenetrable wilderness. For this reason the ascetic's followers had been able to bring for Kalyani plenty of forest fruits and some milk. In the property of the Sannyasin were included a number of cows. At Kalyani's request, Mohendra first took some food, afterwards Kalyani sat apart and ate something of what he had left. She gave some of the milk to her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> and kept the rest to feed her with again. Then both of them, overcome with sleep, took rest for a while. When they woke, they began to discuss where they should go next. \"We left home\" said Kalyani \"in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of danger and misfortune, but I now see there are greater dangers and misfortunes abroad than at home. Come then, let us return to our own house.\" That also was Mohendra's intention. It was his wish to keep Kalyani at home under the care of some suitable guardian and take upon himself this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span>, pure and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> vow of service to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>. Therefore he gave his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> very readily. The husband and wife, rested from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span>, took their daughter in their arms and set forth in the direction of Padchinha.<span class='page-number' id='s-507' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.507]</span>\n\nBut what way led to Padchinha, they could not at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> make out in that thick and difficult forest. They had thought that once they could find the way out of the wood, they would be able to find the road. But now they could not find the way out of the wood itself. After long wandering in the thickets, their circlings began to bring them round to the monastery once more, no way of exit could be found. In front of them they saw an unknown ascetic in the dress of a Vaishnav Gosain, who stood in the path and laughed at them. Mohendra, in some irritation, said to him, \"What are you laughing at, Gosain?\"\n\n\"How did you enter the forest?\" asked the Gosain.\n\n\"Well, we have entered it, it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> how.\"\n\n\"Then, when you have entered, how is it you cannot get out again?\" So saying, the ascetic resumed his laughter.\n\n\"Since you laugh,\" said Mohendra, much provoked, \"I presume you can yourself get out?\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said the Vaishnav, \"I will show you the way. You must undoubtedly have entered the forest in the company of some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the ascetics. No one else knows the way either into or out of the forest.\"\n\nOn this Mohendra asked, \"Are you one of the Children?\"\n\n\"I am\" answered the Vaishnav. \"Come with me. It is to show you the way that I am standing here.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked Mohendra.\n\n\"My name\" replied the Vaishnav \"is Dhirananda Go swami.\"\n\nDhirananda proceeded in front, Mohendra and Kalyani followed. Dhirananda took them out of the forest by a very difficult path and again plunged back among the trees.\n\nOn leaving the forest one came after a little to a common with trees. To one side of it there was the highway running along the forest, and in one place a little river flowed out of the woodland with a murmuring sound. Its water was very clear, but dark like a thick cloud. On either bank beautiful dark-green trees of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> kinds threw their shadow over the river and in their branches birds of different families sat and gave forth their various notes. Those notes too were sweet and mingled with the<span class='page-number' id='s-508' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.508]</span> sweet cadence of the stream. With a similar <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> the shadow of the trees agreed and mingled with the colour of the stream. Kalyani sat under a tree on the bank and bade her husband sit near. Mohendra sat down, and she took her child from her husband's lap into her own. Kalyani held her husband's hand in hers and for some time sat in silence, then she asked, \"Today I see that you are very melancholy. The calamity that was on us, we have escaped; why then are you so sad?\"\n\nMohendra answered with a deep sigh, \"I am no longer my own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, and what I am to do, I cannot understand.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Kalyani.\n\n\"Hear what happened to me after I lost you,\" said Mohendra, and he gave a detailed account of all that had happened to him.\n\nKalyani said, \"I too have suffered greatly and gone through many misadventures. It will be of no advantage to you to hear it. I cannot say how I managed to sleep in such exceeding misadventure, but today in the early hours of the morning I fell asleep, and in my sleep I saw a dream. I saw—I cannot say by what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of previous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> works I went there,—but I saw myself in a region of wonder, where there was no solid Earth, but only light, a very soft sweet light as if of a cool lustre broken by clouds. There was no human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> there, only luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, no noise, only a sound as if of sweet song and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> at a great distance. Myriads of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span> seemed to be ever newly in bloom, for the scent of them was there, jasmines of many kinds and other sweet-smelling blossoms. There in a place high over all, the cynosure of all, one seemed to be sitting, like a dark blue hill that has grown bright as fire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>burns</span> softly from within. A great fiery crown was on his head, his arms seemed to be four. Those who sat at either side of him, I could not recognize, but I think they were women in their forms, but so full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, light and fragrance that every time I gazed in that direction, my senses were perplexed, I could not fix my gaze nor see who they were. In front of the Four-Armed another woman's form seemed to be standing. She too was luminous, but surrounded by clouds so that the light could not well manifest itself; it could<span class='page-number' id='s-509' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.509]</span> only be dimly realised that one in the form of a woman wept, one full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>'s distress, one worn and thin, but beautiful exceedingly. It seemed to me that a soft fragrant wind carried me along, pushing me as with waves, till it brought me to the foot of the Four-Armed's throne. It seemed to me that the worn and cloud-besieged woman pointed to me and said, This is she, for whose sake Mohendra will not come to my bosom.' Then there was a sound like the sweet clear music of a flute; it seemed that the Four-Armed said to me, Leave your husband and come to Me. This is your Mother, your husband will serve her; but if you stay at your husband's side, that service cannot be given. Come away to Me.' I wept and said, How shall I come, leaving my husband?' Then the flutelike voice came again, I am husband, father, mother, son, daughter; come to Me.' I do not remember what I said. Then I woke.\" Kalyani spoke and was again silent.\n\nMohendra also, astonished, amazed, alarmed, kept silence. Overhead the doyel began its clamour, the papia flooded heaven with its voice, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> of the cuckoo set the regions echoing, the bhringaraj made the grove quiver with its sweet cry. At their feet the stream murmured softly between its banks. The wind carried to them the soft fragrance of the woodland flowers. In places bits of sunlight glittered on the waves of the rivulet. Somewhere palm-leaves rustled in the slow wind. Far off a blue range of mountains met the eye. For a long time they remained silent in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>. Then Kalyani again asked, \"What are you thinking?\"\n\n\"I am thinking what I should do. The dream is nothing but a thought of fear, it is born of itself in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and of itself it disappears,—a bubble from the waking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. Come, let us go home.\"\n\n\"Go where <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> bids you,\" said Kalyani and put her child in her husband's lap.\n\nMohendra took his daughter in his lap and said, \"And you,—where will you go?\"\n\nKalyani, covering her eyes with her hands and pressing her forehead between them, answered, \"I too will go where God has bid me.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-510' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.510]</span>\n\nMohendra started and said, \"Where is that? How will you go?\"\n\nKalyani showed him the small box of poison.\n\nMohendra said in astonishment, \"What, you will take poi son?\"\n\n\"I meant to take it, but—\" Kalyani became silent and began to think. Mohendra kept his gaze on her face and every moment seemed to him a year, but when he saw that she did not complete her unfinished words, he asked, \"But what? What were you going to say?\"\n\n\"I meant to take it, but leaving you behind, leaving Sukumari behind, I have no wish to go to Paradise itself. I will not die.\"\n\nWith the words Kalyani set down the box on the earth. Then the two began to talk of the past and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and became absorbed in their talk. Taking advantage of their absorption the child in her play took up the box of poison. Neither of them observed it.\n\nSukumari thought, \"This is a very fine toy.\" She held it in her left hand and slapped it well with her right, put it in her right, and slapped it with her left. Then she began pulling at it with both hands. As a result the box opened and the pill fell out.\n\nSukumari saw the little pill fall on her father's cloth and took it for another toy. She threw the box away and pounced on the pill.\n\nHow it was that Sukumari had not put the box into her mouth, it is hard to say, but she made no delay in respect of the pill. \"Eat it as soon as you get it;\"—Sukumari crammed the pill into her mouth. At that moment her mother's attention was attracted to her.\n\n\"What has she eaten? What has she eaten?\" cried Kalyani, and she thrust her finger into the child's mouth. Then both saw that the box of poison was lying empty. Then Sukumari, thinking that here was another game, clenched her teeth,—only a few had just come out,—and smiled in her mother's face. By this time the taste of the poison-pill must have begun to feel bitter in<span class='page-number' id='s-511' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.511]</span> the mouth, for a little after she loosened the clench of her teeth of herself and Kalyani took out the pill and threw it away. The child began to cry.\n\nThe pill fell on the ground. Kalyani dipped the loose end of her robe in the stream and poured the water into her daughter's mouth. In a tone of pitiful anxiety she asked Mohendra, \"Has a little of it gone down her throat?\"\n\nIt is the worst that comes first to a parent's mind,—the greater the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, the greater the fear. Mohendra had not seen how large the pill was before, but now, after taking the pill into his hand and scrutinising it for some time, he said, \"I think she has sucked in a good deal of it.\"\n\nNecessarily, Kalyani adopted Mohendra's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>. For a long time she too held the pill in her hand and examined it. Mean while the child, owing to the little she had swallowed, became a little indisposed; she grew restless, cried, at last grew a little dull and feeble. Then Kalyani said to her husband, \"What more? Sukumari has gone the way God called me to go. I too must follow her.\"\n\nAnd with the words Kalyani put the pill into her mouth and in a moment had swallowed it.\n\nMohendra cried out, \"What have you done, Kalyani, what have you done?\"\n\nKalyani returned no answer, but taking the dust of her husband's feet on her head, only said, \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span>, words will only multiply words. I take farewell.\"\n\nBut Mohendra cried out again, \"Kalyani, what have you done?\" and began to weep aloud. Then Kalyani said in a very soft voice, \"I have done well. You might otherwise neglect the work given you by Heaven for the sake of so worthless a thing as a woman. See, I was transgressing a divine command, therefore my child has been taken from me. If I disregarded it farther, you too might go.\"\n\nMohendra replied with tears, \"I could have kept you some where and come back,—when our work had been accomplished, I could have again been happy with you. Kalyani, my all! Why have you done this thing? You have cut from me the<span class='page-number' id='s-512' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.512]</span> hand by whose strength I could have held the sword. What am I without you?\"\n\n\"Where could you have taken me? Where is there any place? Mother, father, friends, all in this terrible time of calamity have perished. In whose house is there any place for us, where is the road we can travel, where will you take me? I am a burden hanging on your neck. I have done well to die. Give me this blessing that when I have gone to that luminous world, I may again see you.\" With the words Kalyani again took the dust of her husband's feet and placed it on her head. Mohendra made no reply, but once more began to weep. Kalyani again spoke;—her voice was very soft, very sweet, very tender, as she again said, \"Consider who has the strength to transgress what God has willed. He has laid his command on me to go; could I stay, if I would? If I had not died of my own will, inevitably someone else would have slain me. I do well to die. Perform with your whole strength the vow you have undertaken, it will create a force of well-doing by which I shall attain heaven and both of us together will enjoy celestial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> to all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span>.\"\n\nMeanwhile the little girl threw up the milk she had drunk and recovered,—the small amount of poison that she had swallowed, was not fatal. But at that time Mohendra's mind was not turned in that direction. He put his daughter in Kalyani's lap and closely embracing both of them began to weep incessantly. Then it seemed that in the midst of the forest a soft yet thunder-deep sound arose,—\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\nO Gopal, O Govinda, O Mukunda, O Shauri!\"\n\nBy that time the poison had begun to act on Kalyani, her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> was being somewhat taken from her; in her half unconscious condition she seemed to herself to hear the words ringing out in the marvellous flutelike voice she had heard in the Vaikuntha of her dream.\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\nO Gopal, O Govinda, O Mukunda, O Shauri!\"<span class='page-number' id='s-513' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.513]</span>\n\nThen Kalyani in her semi-unconsciousness began to sing in a voice sweeter than any Apsara's,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nShe cried to Mohendra, \"Say,\n\n>'O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!'\"\n\nDeeply moved by the sweet voice that rose from the forest and the sweet voice of Kalyani and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> of his heart thinking \"God is my only helper,\" Mohendra called aloud,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nThen from all sides the sound arose,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nThen it seemed as if the very birds in the trees were singing,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nIt seemed as if the murmurs of the river repeated,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nThen Mohendra, forgetting his grief and affliction and full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>, sang in one voice with Kalyani,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nFrom the forest the cry seemed to rise in chorus with their song,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nKalyani's voice became fainter and fainter, but still she cried,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nThen by degrees her voice grew hushed, no sound came from her lips, her eyes closed, her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> grew cold, and Mohendra understood that Kalyani had departed to Vaikuntha with the cry of \"O Hari, O Murari\" on her lips. Then Mohendra began to call out loudly like one frantic, making the forest quiver,<span class='page-number' id='s-514' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.514]</span> startling the birds and beasts,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nAt that time one came and, embracing him closely, began to call with him in a voice as loud as his,\n\n>\"O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!\"\n\nThen in that glory of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, in that boundless forest, before the body of her who now travelled the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> way, the two sang the name of Eternal God. The birds and beasts were voiceless, the earth full of a miraculous beauty,—the fit ting temple for this highest anthem. Satyananda sat down with Mohendra in his arms.<span class='page-number' id='s-515' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.515]</span>"},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter XIII","txt":"Meanwhile there was a great commotion in the high road in the capital. The noise went abroad that Sannyasins had plundered the revenue that was <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> despatched from the royal treasury to Calcutta. Then by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> sepoys and spearmen sped on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> sides to seize Sannyasins. Now at that time in that famine-stricken country there was no great number of real Sannyasins; for these ascetics live upon alms, and when people themselves get nothing to eat, there is not likely to be anyone to give alms to the mendicant. Therefore all the genuine ascetics had fled from the pinch of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span> to the country about Benares and Prayag. Only the Children wore the robe of the Sannyasin when they willed, abandoned it when abandonment was needed. Now too, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span>, seeing trouble abroad, left the dress of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>. For this reason the hungry retainers of power, unable to find a Sannyasin any where, could only break the water-jars and cooking-pots of the householders and return with their empty bellies only half-filled. Satyananda alone would at no time leave his saffron robe.\n\nAt the moment when on the bank of that dark and murmurous rivulet, on the borders of the high road, at the foot of the tree on the water's verge, Kalyani lay still and Mohendra and Satyananda in each other's embrace were calling on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> with streaming eyes, Jamadar Nazir-ud-din and his sepoys arrived at the spot. Forthwith he put his hand on Satyananda's throat and said, \"Here is a rascal of a Sannyasin.\" Immediately another seized Mohendra; for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who consorts with Sannyasins, must necessarily be a Sannyasin. A third hero was about to arrest the dead <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of Kalyani where it lay at length on the grass. Then he saw that it was the corpse of a woman and very possibly might not be a Sannyasin, and did not proceed with the arrest. On the same reasoning they left the little girl alone. Then without<span class='page-number' id='s-516' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.516]</span> colloquy of any kind they bound the two prisoners and marched them off. The corpse of Kalyani and her little daughter remained lying unprotected at the foot of the tree.\n\nMohendra was at first almost senseless with the oppression of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and the frenzy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>; he could not understand what was toward or what had happened and made no objection to being bound; but when they had gone a few paces, he awoke to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that they were being led away in bonds. Immediately it occurred to him that Kalyani's corpse was left lying without funeral rites, that his little daughter was left lying, and that even now wild beasts might devour them, he wrenched his hands apart by sheer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> wrench tore his bonds apart. With one kick he sent the Jamadar sprawling to the ground and fell upon one of the sepoys; but the other three seized him from three sides and once more overpowered and rendered him helpless. Then Mohendra in the wretchedness of his grief said to the Brahmacharin Satyananda, \"If only you had helped me a little, I would have slain these five miscreants.\" \"What strength is there\" answered Satyananda, \"in this aged body of mine,—except Him on whom I was calling, I have no other strength.

The village of Podchinha lay oppressed under a tyrannous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> of the mid summer sun. The village was packed with houses, but people were nowhere to be seen. Rows of shops in the bazaar, rows of booths in the market place, hundreds of clay houses in every quarter with here and there high and low terraced mansions; but today <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> was silent. In the bazaar the shops were shut; the shopkeepers had fled, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> knows not where. It was market-day, but the market was not in swing,—begging-day, but the beggars were not out. The weaver had stopped his loom and lay weeping to one side of his cottage; the trader had ceased to ply his trade and sat weeping with his infant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> in his lap; the giver had ceased to give; the teacher had shut up his school; even the little children had no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> or courage left to cry. No passers-by were to be seen in the highway, no bathers in the lake, no human figures at the house-doors; there was not a bird in the trees, not a cow in the pasture; only in the burning-ground the dog and the jackal were abroad. One huge building whose great fluted pillars could be seen from far off bore a brave appearance as of a mountain peak arising out of this wilderness of houses. But today its splendour was a void thing, its doors shut, its rooms empty of human concourse, all its voices hushed, entry difficult even to the breezes. In a room within this building there was darkness at midday and in the darkness like twin <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span> blooming in the night a young couple, husband and wife, were sitting plunged in thought. And in front of them sat the spectre of Famine.\n\nThe harvest of 1174 had not been <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>; so in 1175 rice was dear and the people suffered, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> exacted the taxes to the last fraction of a farthing.

But in 1175 there was good rain and the people thought that Heaven had taken pity on them. The herds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> began again to sing in his gladness in the meadow, and the peasant's wife to tease her husband for a silver armlet. But suddenly in the month of Aswin Heaven turned away its face. Not a drop of rain fell through all Aswin and Kartik. In the fields the stalks dried up and became mere straw and wherever a field or two had borne its crop the officials bought it up for the troops. The people had nothing to eat. At first they fasted at one of their two meal-times, then they began to eat one half meal a day, then to fast both morning & evening. Whatever little crop there was in the month of Chaitra never reached their mouths. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomed</span> Reza Khan, who controlled the collection of the Revenues and thought that he could now show himself a very Sarafraz, increased at one leap the taxes by ten percent.

They began to fast; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> attacked them. They sold their cows, they sold plough and tool, they sold their seed, sold their houses, sold their plots of land. Then they began to sell their girls, then their boys, then their wives. In the end there was no one to buy wife, boy or girl. All were sellers; buyer there was none. For want of other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span>, men began to eat the leaves of trees, to eat grass, to eat weeds. The low <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> & the wild people devoured dogs, rats and cats. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> fled the country. Those who fled perished of starvation in other lands; those who remained living upon uneatable things or not eating at all, began to fall ill and die of various maladies.\n\nDisease had its high day; fever, cholera, consumption, small pox raged. Small-pox was especially prevalent; there were deaths in almost every house. No one would give water to the sick, no one would touch, no one would treat the disease or tend the sufferer; when he died there was no one to dispose of the corpse; the bodies of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> lay rotting uncared-for in their terraced mansions. For into whatever house the small-pox made its entry the inhabitants fled from it in terror abandoning the sick to their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-520' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.520]</span>\n\nMahendra Singh was one of the richest men in the village of Podchinha, but today rich and poor were on one & the same level. In this time of misery and disease his relatives and dependants, his serving-men, his serving-women, all were gone. Some had perished, others had fled. In all that populous household there was now left only his wife and himself and an infant daughter. It was they who were sitting in the darkened chamber.\n\nThe wife Kalyani rose from her reflections, went into the cowshed and herself milked the cow. Then she warmed the milk, gave her child to drink and went again to give grass & water to the cow. When she came back, Mahendra said, \"How long can this go on?\"\n\nShe answered \"Not long, but let us continue as long as we can. Till then I will manage to keep things going; afterwards do you take the child to the town.\"\n\n\"If we must go in the end, why should I put you through all this trouble? Let us rather go now.\"\n\nThe two debated the question for a long time.\n\nKalyani asked, \"Is there anything really to be gained by going?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Perhaps the town is as solitary as this village and as empty of all means of subsistence.\"\n\n\"If we go to Murshidabad, Cassimbazaar or Calcutta, we may live. No, there is every reason why we should leave this place.\"\n\nMahendra replied, \"This house has long been full of the stored up wealth of generations. All will be plundered by thieves.\"\n\n\"If they came to plunder now, could we two prevent them? Unless we live, who will there be to make use of this wealth? Come, let us at once shut up everything and go. If we live, then we can return and again enjoy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and riches.\"\n\nMahendra asked her, \"Will you be able to walk all that way? The palanquin bearers are dead; where there are bullocks, there is no cartman; where there is a cartman, bullocks are not to be had.\"\n\n\"That need not trouble you; I shall walk.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-521' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.521]</span>\n\nIn her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> she had resolved that if need be, she would fall down and die by the wayside, but these two must live.\n\nNext day at dawn they took some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> with them, locked all the doors, loosed the cows, took their child in their arms and started for the capital. At the time of starting Mahendra said \"It is a difficult road and at every step of it robbers are wandering in search of their prey; it is well to go armed.\" He returned into the house and came back with gun, powder and bullets.\n\nKalyani, when she saw the gun, said to her husband, \"Since you have thought of it, take Sukumari for a moment. I too will have a weapon with me.\" With this she put her daughter into Mahendra's arms and entered the house, Mahendra calling after her in surprise, \"Why, what weapon can you carry?\"\n\nIt was a little box of poison that Kalyani hid in her dress as she came. She had been provided for some time with this arm against any ill fate that might befall her in these days of adversity.\n\nIt was the month of Jyestha, and the heat was fierce & pitiless; the earth burned as with fire, the wind scattered its flaming breath, the sky was like a canopy of heated bronze, the dust of the road like sparks of flame. Kalyani began to perspire and walked on with difficulty and suffering; she sat down some times under a babul tree, sometimes in the shade of a date palm, sometimes she drank the muddy water of a dried-up pond. Mahendra carried the child in his arms and fanned it from time to time. Once they rested in the shade of a creeper-hung tree richly coloured with dark green leaves and fragrant with sweet-scented flowers. Mahendra wondered at Kalyani's power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span>. He wet his robe and sprinkled water from a neighbouring pool on his own & Kalyani's face, feet and forehead.\n\nKalyani was a little refreshed, but both husband & wife were tortured with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span>. Their own hunger could be borne, but not the hunger & thirst of their child, so they began again to travel forward and making their way through the waves of fire arrived before evening at a hamlet. Mahendra was full of hope, for he expected that here he would find cool water to unparch the throats of his wife and daughter and food to sustain their<span class='page-number' id='s-522' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.522]</span> lives. But no, there was not a man in the place. Large houses lay empty; all the inhabitants had fled. After searching here & there for a while Mahendra made his wife and child lie down in a room while he himself went out and began to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> loudly. There was no answer. Then he said to Kalyani, \"Be brave and remain here alone by yourself, I will go and if there is a cow in the place, if Srikrishna takes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> on us, bring some milk for us to drink.\" So saying, he took up an earthen water-pot in his hand,—there were a great many lying there,—and sallied out."},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","t":"Chapter II","txt":"When Mahendra had gone, Kalyani, left alone with her little girl, in that solitary place, in that gloomy cottage, began to gaze around her and a growing terror took hold of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>.

As she was thus gazing fearfully around her, she saw something like a shadow in the doorway opposite. It looked like a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>'s form but hardly seemed to be human. Yet it was something like a man, withered, wasted, black, terrible that had come & stood in the doorway. A little while and the shadow seemed to raise an arm; a very long withered arm, all skin and bone, appeared to be beckoning to someone with its long withered fingers.

Slowly, silently they began to enter the room, the gloom-haunted cottage grew terrible as a midnight burning-ground.

But none of them has it pursued, embraced, sung with a more exultant passion of intimate realisation than the yearning for God the Lover, God the Beloved. It would seem as if this passionate human symbol were the natural culminating-point for the mounting flame of the soul's devotion: for it is found wherever that devotion has entered into the most secret shrine of the inner temple. We meet it in Islamic poetry; certain experiences of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystics</span></span> repeat the forms and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> with which we are familiar in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span>, but usually with a certain timorousness foreign to the Eastern temperament. For the devotee who has once had this intense experience it is that which admits to the most profound and hidden mystery of the universe; for him the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> has the key of the last secret.\n\nThe work of a great Bengali poet has recently reintroduced this idea to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European mind</span>, which has so much lost the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of its old religious traditions as to welcome and wonder at it as a novel form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> self-expression.

And in the Vaishnavism of the far South, in the songs of the Tamil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Alwars</span> we find it again in another form, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> a powerful and original turn to the images of our old classic poetry; for there it has been sung out by the rapt heart of a woman to the Heart of the Universe.\n\nThe Tamil word, Alwar, means <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> who has drowned, lost himself in the sea of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. Among these canonised saints of Southern Vaishnavism ranks Vishnuchitta, Yogin and poet, of Villipattan in the land of the Pandyas. He is termed *Perialwar*, the great Alwar. A tradition, which we need not believe, places him in the ninety-eighth year of the Kaliyuga. But these divine singers are ancient enough, since they precede the great saint and philosopher Ramanuja whose personality and teaching were the last flower of the long-growing Vaishnava tradition. Since his time Southern Vaishnavism has been a fixed creed and a system rather than a creator of new spiritual greatnesses.\n\nThe poetess <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Andal</span> was the foster-daughter of Vishnuchitta, found by him, it is said, a new-born child under the sacred tulsi-plant. We know little of Andal except what we can gather from a few legends, some of them richly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and symbolic. Most of Vishnuchitta's poems have the infancy and boyhood of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span> for their subject. Andal, brought up in that atmosphere, cast into the mould of her life what her foster-father had sung in inspired hymns.

His father, Kari, was a petty prince who paid tribute to the Pandyan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> of Madura. We have no means of ascertaining the date of the Alwar's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, as the traditional account is untrustworthy and full of inconsistencies. We are told that the infant was mute for several years after his birth. Nammalwar renounced the world early in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and spent his time singing and meditating on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> under the shade of a tamarind tree by the side of the village temple.\n\nIt was under this tree that he was first seen by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disciple</span>, the Alwar Madhura-kavi,—for the latter also is numbered among the great Twelve, \"lost in the sea of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>\". Tradition says that while Madhura-kavi was wandering in North <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> as a pilgrim, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> night a strange light appeared to him in the sky and travelled towards the South. Doubtful at first what significance this phenomenon might have for him, its repetition during three consecutive nights convinced him that it was a divine summons and where this luminous sign led he must follow. Night after night he journeyed southwards till the guiding light came to Kuruhur and there disappeared. Learning of Nammalwar's spiritual greatness he thought that it was to him that the light had been leading him. But when he came to him, he found him absorbed in deep <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> with his eyes fast closed and although he waited for hours the Samadhi did not break until he took up a large stone and struck it against the ground violently. At the noise Nammalwar opened his eyes, but still remained<span class='page-number' id='s-585' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.585]</span> silent. Madhura-kavi then put to him the following enigmatical question, \"If the little one (the soul) is born into the dead thing (<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span>)[^1] what will the little one eat and where will the little one lie?\" to which Nammalwar replied in an equally enigmatic style, \"That will it eat and there will it lie.\"\n\n[^1]: The form of the question reminds one of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Epictetus</span>' definition of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, \"Thou <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> a little soul carrying about a corpse.\" Some of our readers may be familiar with Swinburne's adaptation of the saying, \"A little soul for a little bears up the corpse which is man.\"\n\nSubsequently Nammalwar permitted his disciple to live with him and it was Madhura-kavi who wrote down his songs as they were composed. Nammalwar died in his thirty-fifth year, but he has achieved so great a reputation that the Vaishnavas account him an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incarnation</span> of Vishnu himself, while others are only the mace, discus, conch etc. of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Deity</span>.\n\nFrom the philosophical and spiritual point of view, his poetry ranks among the highest in Tamil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>. But in point of literary excellence, there is a great inequality; for while some songs touch the level of the loftiest world-poets, others, even though rich in rhythm and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, fall much below the poet's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>. In his great work known as the Tiru-vay-moli (the Sacred Utterance) which contains more than a thousand stanzas, he has touched <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the phases of the life divine and given expression to all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of spiritual experience. The pure and passionless Reason, the direct perception in the high solar realm of Truth itself, the ecstatic and sometimes poignant love that leaps into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> at the vision of the \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beauty</span> of God's face\", the final Triumph where unity is achieved and \"I and my Father are one\"—all these are uttered in his simple and flowing lines with a strength that is full of tenderness and truth.\n\nThe lines which we translate below are a fair specimen of the great Alwar's poetry; but it has suffered considerably in the translation,—indeed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of the Tamil tongue hardly permits of an effective rendering, so utterly divergent is it from that of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language.<span class='page-number' id='s-586' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.586]</span>","url":"/cwsa/05/nammalwar-the-supreme-vaishnava-saint-and-poet","volt":"Translations","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"05","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Translations","u":"/cwsa/05"},{"t":"Translations from Tamil"},{"t":"Nammalwar"}],"nxtt":"Nammalwar's Hymn of the Golden Age","nxtu":"/cwsa/05/nammalwars-hymn-of-the-golden-age","prvt":"Ye Others","prvu":"/cwsa/05/ye-others","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["nammalwars-hymn-of-the-golden-age"],"t":"Nammalwar's Hymn of the Golden Age","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"(1) 'Tis glory, glory, glory!
