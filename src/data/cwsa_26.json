It raises thought which goes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the strict limits of the author's subject and suggests the whole question of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> of poetry in the age which is coming upon us, the higher functions open to it—as yet very imperfectly fulfilled,—and the part which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English literature</span> on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> side and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span></span> and temperament on the other are likely to take in determining the new trend. The author is himself a poet, a writer of considerable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Irish <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span></span> which has given contemporary English literature its two greatest poets, and the book on every page attracts and satisfies by its living force of style, its almost perfect measure, its delicacy of touch, its fineness and depth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> and insight, its just sympathy and appreciation.\n\nFor the purpose for which these essays have been, not indeed written, but put together, the criticism, fine and helpful as it is, suffers from one great fault,—there is too little of it. Mr. Cousins is satisfied with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> us the essential, just what is necessary for a trained mind to seize intimately the spirit and manner and poetic quality of the writers whose work he brings before us. This is done sometimes in such a masterly manner that even one touch more might well have been a touch in excess. The essay on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Emerson</span> is a masterpiece in this kind; it gives perfectly in a few pages <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> that should be said about Emerson's poetry and nothing that need not be said. But some of the essays, admirable in themselves, are too slight for our need. The book is not indeed intended to be exhaustive in its range. Mr. Cousins<span class='page-number' id='s-3' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.3]</span> wisely takes for the most part,—there is one notable exception,—writers with whom he is in close poetical sympathy or for whom he has a strong appreciation; certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> which have come over to our ears with some flourish of the trumpets of renown, Thompson, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Masefield</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hardy</span>, do not occur at all or only in a passing allusion. But still the book deals among contemporary poets with Tagore, A. E. and Yeats, among recent poets with Stephen Phillips, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Meredith</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span>, great names all of them, not to speak of lesser writers. This little book with its 135 short pages is almost too small a pedestal for the figures it has to support, not, be it understood, for the purposes of the English reader interested in poetry, but for ours in India who have on this subject a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and, most of us, a very poorly trained critical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. We need something a little more ample to enchain our attention and fix in us a permanent interest; a fingerpost by the way is not enough for the Indian reader, you will have to carry him some miles on the road if you would have him follow it.\n\nBut Mr. Cousins has done a great service to the Indian mind by giving it at all a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> to follow this direction with such a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> to point out the way. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span> and literature is practically the only window the Indian mind, with the narrow and meagre and yet burdensome <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> given to it, possesses into the world of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> and culture; but at least as possessed at present, it is a painfully small and insufficient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> for all but a few of us stops short with Tennyson and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span>, when it does not stop with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> and Shelley. A few have heard of some of the recent, fewer of some of the contemporary poets; their readers are hardly enough to make a number. In this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of culture this huge peninsula, once one of the greatest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, has been for long the most provincial of provinces; it has been a patch of tilled fields round a lawyer's office and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> cutcherry, a cross between a little district town and the most rural of villages, at its largest a dried-up bank far away from the great stream of the world's living thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, visited with no great force by occasional and belated waves, but for the rest a bare field for<span class='page-number' id='s-4' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.4]</span> sluggish activities, the falsest possible education, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> always twenty-five or fifty years behind the time. The awakening brought by the opening years of the twentieth century has chiefly taken the form of a revival of cultural patriotism, highly necessary for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> which has a distinctive contribution to make to the human spirit in its future development, some new and great thing which it must evolve out of a magnificent past for the opening splendours of the future; but in order that this may evolve rapidly and surely, it needs a wide and sound information, a richer stuff to work upon, a more vital touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> tendencies of the world around it. Such books as this will be of invaluable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> in creating what is now deficient.\n\nThe helpfulness of this suggestive work comes more home to me personally because I have shared to the full the state of mere blank which is the ordinary condition of the Indian mind with regard to its subject. Such touch as in the intellectual remoteness of India I have been able to keep up with the times, had been with contemporary continental rather than contemporary English literature. With the latter all vital connection came to a dead stop with my departure from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> a quarter of a century ago; it had for its last events the discovery of Meredith as a poet, in his *Modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>*, and the perusal of *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hades</span>*,—some years before its publication,—the latter an unforgettable date. I had long heard, standing aloof in giant ignorance, the great name of Yeats, but with no more than a fragmentary and mostly indirect acquaintance with some of his work; A. E. only lives for me in Mr. Cousins' pages; other poets of the day are still represented in my mind by scattered citations. In the things of culture such a state of ignorance is certainly an unholy state of sin; but in this immoral and imperfect world even sin has sometimes its rewards, and I get that now in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and light of a new world opening to me all in one view while I stand, Cortez-like, on the peak of the large impression created for me by Mr. Cousins' book. For the light we get from a vital and illuminative criticism from within by another mind can sometimes almost take the place of a direct knowledge.\n\nThere disengages itself from these essays not so much a<span class='page-number' id='s-5' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.5]</span> special point of view as a distinctive critical and literary temperament, which may be perhaps not so much the whole mind of the critic as the response to his subject in a mind naturally in sympathy with it. Mr. Cousins is a little nervous about this in his preface; he is apprehensive of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> labelled as an idealist. The cut and dried distinction between idealism and realism in literature has always seemed to me to be a little arbitrary and unreal, and whatever its value in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span>, it has no legitimate place in poetry. What we find here is a self-identification with what is best and most characteristic of a new spirit in the age, a new developing aesthetic temper and outlook,—or should we rather say, inlook? Its mark is a greater (not exclusive) tendency to the spiritual rather than the merely earthly, to the inward and subjective than the outward and objective, to the life within and behind than to the life in front, and in its purest, which seems to be its Irish form, a preference of the lyrical to the dramatic and of the inwardly suggestive to the concrete method of poetical presentation. Every distinctive temperament has naturally the defect of an insufficient sympathy, often a pronounced and intolerant antipathy towards all that departs from its own motives. Moreover contemporary criticism is beset with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> dangers; there is the charm of new thought and feeling and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of tendency which blinds us to the defects and misplaces or mis-proportions to our view the real merits of the expression itself; there are powerful cross-currents of immediate attraction and repulsion which carry us from the true track; especially, there is the inevitable want of perspective which prevents us from getting a right vision of things too near us in time. And if in addition one is oneself part of a creative movement with powerful tendencies and a pronounced ideal, it becomes difficult to get away from the standpoint it creates to a larger critical outlook. From these reefs and shallows Mr. Cousins' sense of measure and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> of appreciation largely, generally indeed, preserve him, though not, I think, quite invariably. But still it is not a passionless, quite disinterested criticism which we get or want from this book, but a much more helpful thing, an interpretation of work which embodies the creative tendencies of the time by one who has<span class='page-number' id='s-6' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.6]</span> himself lived in them and helped both to direct and to form.\n\nMr. Cousins' positive criticism is almost always fine, just and inspired by a warm glow of sympathy and understanding tempered by discernment, restraint and measure; whatever the future critic, using his scales and balance, may have to take away from it, will be, one would imagine, only by way of a slight alteration of stress here and there. His depreciations, though generally sound enough, are not, I think, invariably as just as his appreciations. Thus his essay on the work of J. M. Synge, \"The Realist on the Stage\", is, in sharp distinction from the rest of the book, an almost entirely negative and destructive criticism, strong and interesting, but written from the point of view of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of the Irish literary movement against a principle of work which seemed entirely to depart from them; yet we are allowed to get some glimpse of a positive side of dramatic power which the critic does not show us, but leaves us rather to guess at. Mr. Cousins seems to me to take the dramatist's theory of his own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> more seriously than it should be taken; for the creator can seldom be accepted—there may of course be exceptions, rare instances of clairvoyant self-sight—as a sound exponent of his own creative impulse. He is in his central <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of a light and power not his own, and his account of it is usually vitiated, out of focus, an attempt to explain the workings of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> power by motives which were the contribution of his own personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, but which are often quite subordinate or even accidental side-lights of the lower brain-mind, not the central moving force.\n\nMr. Cousins has pointed out clearly enough that art can never be a copy of life. But it is also true, I think, that that is not the secret object of most realism, whatever it may say about itself; realism is in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> a sort of nether idealism, or, perhaps more correctly, sometimes an inverse, sometimes a perverse romanticism which tries to get a revelation of creative truth by an effective force of presentation, by an intensity, often an exaggeration at the opposite side of the complex phenomenon of life. All art starts from the sensuous and sensible, or takes it as a continual point of reference or, at the lowest, uses it as a<span class='page-number' id='s-7' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.7]</span> symbol and a fount of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span>; even when it soars into invisible worlds, it is from the earth that it soars; but equally all art worth the name must go beyond the visible, must reveal, must show us something that is hidden, and in its total effect not reproduce but create. We may say that the artist creates an ideal world of his own, not necessarily in the sense of ideal perfection, but a world that exists in the idea, the imagination and vision of the creator. More truly, he throws into significant form a truth he has seen, which may be truth of hell or truth of heaven or an immediate truth behind things terrestrial or any other, but is never merely the external truth of earth. By that ideative truth and the power, the perfection and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of his presentation and utterance of it his work must be judged.\n\nSome occasional utterances in this book seem to spring from very pronounced idiosyncrasies of its distinctive literary temperament or standpoint and cannot always be accepted without reservation. I do not myself share its rather disparaging <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> towards the dramatic form and motive or its comparative coldness towards the architectural faculty and impulse in poetry. When Mr. Cousins tells us that \"its poetry and not its drama, will prove to be the thing of life\" in Shakespeare's work, I feel that the distinction is not sound all through, that there is a truth behind it, but it is overstated. Or when still more vivaciously he dismisses Shakespeare the dramatist to \"a dusty and reverent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> in the libraries\" or speaks of the \"monstrous net of his life's work\" which but for certain buoys of line and speech \"might sink in the ocean of forgetfulness,\" I cannot help feeling that this can only be at most the mood of the hour born of the effort to get rid of the burden of its past and move more freely towards its future, and not the definitive verdict of the poetic and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span> on what has been so long the object of its sincere admiration and a powerful presence and influence. Perhaps I am wrong, I may be too much influenced by my own settled idiosyncrasies of an aesthetic temperament and being impregnated with an early cult for the work of the great builders in Sanskrit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span>, Italian and English poetry. At any rate, this is true that whatever relation we may keep with the great<span class='page-number' id='s-8' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.8]</span> masters of the past, our present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> is to go beyond and not to repeat them, and it must always be the lyrical motive and spirit which find a new secret and begin a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>; for the lyrical is the primary poetical motive and spirit and the dramatic and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> must wait for it to open for them their new heaven and new earth.\n\nI have referred to these points which are only side issues or occasional touches in Mr. Cousins' book, because they are germane to the question which it most strongly raises, the future of English poetry and of the world's poetry. It is still uncertain how that future will deal with the old quarrel between idealism and realism, for the two tendencies these names roughly represent are still present in the tendencies of recent work. More generally, poetry always sways between two opposite trends, towards predominance of subjective vision and towards an emphasis on objective presentation, and it can rise too beyond these to a spiritual plane where the distinction is exceeded, the divergence reconciled. Again, it is not likely that the poetic imagination will ever give up the narrative and dramatic form of its creative impulse; a new spirit in poetry, even though primarily lyrical, is moved always to seize upon and do what it can with them,—as we see in the impulsion which has driven <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maeterlinck</span>, Yeats, Rabindranath to take hold of the dramatic form for self-expression as well as the lyrical in spite of their dominant subjectivity. We may perhaps think that this was not the proper form for their spirit, that they cannot get there a full or a flawless success; but who shall lay down rules for creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> or say what it shall or shall not attempt? It follows its own course and makes its own shaping experiments. And it is interesting to speculate whether the new spirit in poetry will take and use with modifications the old dramatic and narrative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, as did Rabindranath in his earlier dramatic attempts, or quite transform them to its own ends, as he has attempted in his later work. But after all these are subordinate issues.\n\nIt will be more fruitful to take the main substance of the matter for which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of Mr. Cousins' criticism gives a<span class='page-number' id='s-9' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.9]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>. Taking the impression it creates for a starting-point and the trend of English poetry for our main text, but casting our view farther back into the past, we may try to sound what the future has to give us through the medium of the poetic mind and its power for creation and interpretation. The issues of recent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> are still doubtful and it would be rash to make any confident prediction; but there is one possibility which this book strongly suggests and which it is at least interesting and may be fruitful to search and consider. That possibility is the discovery of a closer approximation to what we might <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the *mantra* in poetry, that rhythmic speech which, as the Veda puts it, rises at once from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the seer and from the distant home of the Truth,—the discovery of the word, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> movement, the form of thought proper to the reality which, as Mr. Cousins excellently says, \"lies in the apprehension of a something stable behind the instability of word and deed, something that is a reflection of the fundamental passion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> for something beyond itself, something that is a dim shadowing of the divine urge which is prompting all creation to unfold itself and to rise out of its limitations towards its Godlike possibilities.\" Poetry in the past has done that in moments of supreme elevation; in the future there seems to be some chance of its making it a more conscious aim and steadfast endeavour.<span class='page-number' id='s-10' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.10]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-mantra","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Essence of Poetry","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-essence-of-poetry","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-essence-of-poetry"],"t":"The Essence of Poetry","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"What then is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of poetry, its essential law? what is the highest power we can demand from it, what the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> that the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, reaching up and in and out to its own widest breadths, deepest depths and topmost summits, can extract from this self-expressive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>? and how out of that does there arise the possibility of its use as the *mantra* of the Real?

But we stand in need of some guiding intuitions, some helpful descriptions which will serve to enlighten our search; to fix in that way, not by definition, but by description, the essential things in poetry is neither an impossible, nor an unprofitable endeavour.\n\nWe meet here two common enough <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span>, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of which the ordinary uninstructed mind is most liable, to the other the too instructed critic or the too intellectually conscientious artist or craftsman. To the ordinary mind, judging poetry without really entering into it, it looks as if it were nothing more than an aesthetic pleasure of the imagination, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and the ear, a sort of elevated pastime. If that were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, we need not have wasted time in seeking for its spirit, its inner aim, its deeper law. Anything pretty, pleasant and melodious with a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> idea in it would serve our turn; a song of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anacreon</span> or a plaint of Mimnermus would be as satisfying to the poetic sense as the Oedipus, Agamemnon or Odyssey, for from this point of view they might well strike us as equally and even, one might contend, more perfect in their light but exquisite unity and brevity. Pleasure, certainly, we expect from poetry as from all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>; but the external sensible and even the inner imaginative pleasure<span class='page-number' id='s-11' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.11]</span> are only first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>. For these must not only be refined in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to meet the highest requirements of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, the imagination and the ear; but afterwards they have to be still farther heightened and in their nature raised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> even their own noblest levels, so that they may become the support for something greater beyond them; otherwise they cannot lead to the height on which lives the Mantra.\n\nFor neither the intelligence, the imagination nor the ear are the true or at least the deepest or highest recipients of the poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>, even as they are not its true or highest creators; they are only its channels and instruments: the true creator, the true hearer is the soul. The more rapidly and transparently the rest do their work of transmission, the less they make of their separate claim to satisfaction, the more directly the word reaches and sinks deep into the soul, the greater the poetry. Therefore poetry has not really done its work, at least its highest work, until it has raised the pleasure of the instrument and transmuted it into the deeper delight of the soul. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>,[^1] a delight interpretative, creative, revealing, formative,—one might almost say, an inverse reflection of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> which the universal Soul felt in its great release of energy when it rang out into the rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of the universe the spiritual truth, the large interpretative idea, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, the power, the emotion of things packed into an original creative vision,—such spiritual joy is that which the soul of the poet feels and which, when he can conquer the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> of his task, he succeeds in pouring also into all those who are prepared to receive it. This delight is not merely a godlike pastime; it is a great formative and illuminative power.\n\n[^1]: Ananda, in the language of Indian spiritual experience, is the essential delight which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span> feels in itself and in its creation. By the infinite Self's Ananda all exists, for the Self's Ananda all was made.\n\nThe critic—of a certain type—or the intellectually conscientious artist will, on the other hand, often talk as if poetry were mainly a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of a faultlessly correct or at most an exquisite technique. Certainly, in all art <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> technique is the first step towards perfection; but there are so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> other steps, there is<span class='page-number' id='s-12' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.12]</span> a whole world beyond before you can get near to what you seek; so much so that even a deficient correctness of execution will not prevent an intense and gifted soul from creating great poetry which keeps its hold on the centuries. Moreover, technique, however indispensable, occupies a smaller field perhaps in poetry than in any other art,—first, because its instrument, the rhythmic word, is fuller of subtle and immaterial elements; then because, the most complex, flexible, variously suggestive of all the instruments of the artistic creator, it has more—almost infinite—possibilities in many directions than any other. The rhythmic word has a subtly sensible element, its sound value, a quite immaterial element, its significance or thought value, and both of these again, its sound and its sense, have separately and together a soul value, a direct spiritual power, which is infinitely the most important thing about them. And though this comes to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> with a small element subject to the laws of technique, yet almost immediately, almost at the beginning of its flight, its power soars up beyond the province of any laws of mechanical construction: and this form of speech carries in it on its summits an element which draws close to the empire of the ineffable.\n\nPoetry rather determines its own form; the form is not imposed on it by any law mechanical or external to it. The poet least of all artists needs to create with his eye fixed anxiously on the technique of his art. He has to possess it, no doubt; but in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> of creation the intellectual sense of it becomes a subordinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> or even a mere undertone in his mind, and in his best moments he is permitted, in a way, to forget it altogether. For then the perfection of his sound-movement and style come entirely as the spontaneous form of his soul: that utters itself in an inspired rhythm and an innate, a revealed word, even as the universal Soul created the harmonies of the universe out of the power of the word secret and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> within him, leaving the mechanical work to be done in a surge of hidden spiritual excitement by the subconscient part of his Nature. It is this highest speech which is the supreme poetic utterance, the immortal element in his poetry, and a little of it is enough to save the rest of his work from oblivion. *Svalpam apyasya dharmasya!*<span class='page-number' id='s-13' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.13]</span>\n\nThis power makes the rhythmic word of the poet the highest form of speech available to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> whether of his self-vision or of his world-vision. It is noticeable that even the deepest experience, the pure spiritual which enters into things that can never be wholly expressed, still, when it does try to express them and not merely to explain them intellectually, tends instinctively to use, often the rhythmic forms, almost always the manner of speech characteristic of poetry. But poetry attempts to extend this manner of vision and utterance to all experience, even the most objective, and therefore it has a natural urge towards the expression of something in the object beyond its mere appearances, even when these seem outwardly to be all that it is enjoying.\n\nWe may usefully cast a glance, not at the last inexpressible secret, but at the first elements of this heightening and intensity peculiar to poetic utterance. Ordinary speech uses language mostly for a limited practical utility of communication; it uses it for life and for the expression of ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> necessary or useful to life. In doing so, we treat words as conventional signs for ideas with nothing but a perfunctory attention to their natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, much as we use any kind of common machine or simple implement; we treat them as if, though useful for life, they were themselves without life. When we wish to put a more vital power into them, we have to lend it to them out of ourselves, by marked intonations of the voice, by the emotional force or vital energy we throw into the sound so as to infuse into the conventional word-sign something which is not inherent in itself. But if we go back earlier in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of language and still more if we look into its origins, we shall, I think, find that it was not always so with human speech. Words had not only a real and vivid life of their own, but the speaker was more conscious of it than we can possibly be with our mechanised and sophisticated intellects. This arose from the primitive nature of language which, probably, in its first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was not intended,—or shall we say, did not intend,—so much to stand for distinct ideas of the intelligence as for feelings, sensations, broad indefinite mental impressions with minute shades of quality in them which we do<span class='page-number' id='s-14' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.14]</span> not now care to pursue. The intellectual sense in its precision must have been a secondary element which grew more dominant as language evolved along with the evolving intelligence.\n\nFor the reason why sound came to express fixed ideas, lies not in any natural and inherent equivalence between the sound and its intellectual sense, for there is none,—intellectually any sound might express any sense, if men were agreed on a conventional equivalence between them; it started from an indefinable quality or property in the sound to raise certain vibrations in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> of the human creature, in his sensational, his emotional, his crude mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. An example may indicate more clearly what I mean. The word wolf, the origin of which is no longer present to our minds, denotes to our intelligence a certain living object and that is all, the rest we have to do for ourselves: the Sanskrit word *vṛka*, \"tearer\", came in the end to do the same thing, but originally it expressed the sensational relation between the wolf and man which most affected the man's life, and it did so by a certain quality in the sound which readily associated it with the sensation of tearing. This must have given early language a powerful life, a concrete vigour, in one direction a natural poetic force which it has lost, however greatly it has gained in precision, clarity, utility.\n\nNow, poetry goes back in a way and recovers, though in another fashion, as much as it can of this original element. It does this partly by a stress on the image replacing the old sensational concreteness, partly by a greater attention to the suggestive force of the sound, its life, its power, the mental impression it carries. It associates this with the definitive thought value contributed by the intelligence and increases both by each other. In that way it succeeds at the same time in carrying up the power of speech to the direct expression of a higher reach of experience than the intellectual or vital. For it brings out not only the definitive intellectual value of the word, not only its power of emotion and sensation, its vital suggestion, but through and beyond these aids its soul-suggestion, its spirit. So poetry arrives at the indication of infinite meanings beyond the finite intellectual meaning the word carries. It expresses not only the life-soul of man as did<span class='page-number' id='s-15' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.15]</span> the primitive word, not only the ideas of his intelligence for which speech now usually serves, but the experience, the vision, the ideas, as we may say, of the higher and wider soul in him. Making them real to our life-soul as well as present to our intellect, it opens to us by the word the doors of the Spirit.\n\nProse style carries speech to a much higher power than its ordinary use, but it differs from poetry in not making this yet greater attempt. For it takes its stand firmly on the intellectual value of the word. It uses rhythms which ordinary speech neglects, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> at a general fluid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of movement. It seeks to associate words agreeably and luminously so as at once to please and to clarify the intelligence. It strives after a more accurate, subtle, flexible and satisfying expression than the rough methods of ordinary speech care to compass. A higher adequacy of speech is its first object. Beyond this adequacy it may aim at a greater forcefulness and effectiveness by various devices of speech, by many rhetorical means for heightening the stress of its intellectual appeal. Passing beyond this first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span>, this just or strong, but always restrained measure, it may admit a more emphatic rhythm, more directly and powerfully stimulate the emotion, appeal to a more vivid aesthetic sense. It may even make such a free or rich use of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> as to suggest an outward approximation to the manner of poetry; but it employs them decoratively, as ornaments, *alaṅkāra*, or for their effective value in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> a stronger intellectual vision of the thing or the thought it describes or defines; it does not use the image for that profounder and more living vision for which the poet is always seeking. And always it has its eye on its chief hearer and judge, the intelligence, and calls in other powers only as important aids to capture his suffrage. Reason and taste, two powers of the intelligence, are rightly the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> of the prose stylist, while to the poet they are only minor deities.\n\nIf it goes beyond these limits, approaches in its measures a more striking rhythmic balance, uses images for sheer vision, opens itself to a mightier breath of speech, prose style passes beyond its normal province and approaches or even enters the confines of poetry. It becomes poetical prose or even poetry<span class='page-number' id='s-16' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.16]</span> itself using the apparent forms of prose as a disguise or a loose apparel. A high or a fine adequacy, effectivity, intellectual illuminativeness and a carefully tempered aesthetic satisfaction are the natural and proper powers of its speech. But the privilege of the poet is to go beyond and discover that more intense illumination of speech, that inspired word and supreme inevitable utterance, in which there meets the unity of a divine rhythmic movement with a depth of sense and a power of infinite suggestion welling up directly from the fountain-heads of the spirit within us. He may not always or often find it, but to seek for it is the law or at least the highest trend of his utterance, and when he can not only find it, but cast into it some deeply revealed truth of the spirit itself, he utters the *mantra*.\n\nBut always, whether in the search or the finding, the whole style and rhythm of poetry are the expression and movement which come from us out of a certain spiritual excitement caused by a vision in the soul of which it is eager to deliver itself. The vision may be of anything in Nature or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> or man or the life of creatures or the life of things; it may be a vision of force and action, or of sensible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, or of truth of thought, or of emotion and pleasure and pain, of this life or the life beyond. It is sufficient that it is the soul which sees and the eye, sense, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and thought-mind become the passive instruments of the soul. Then we get the real, the high poetry. But if what acts is too much an excitement of the intellect, the imagination, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, the vital activities seeking rhythmical and forceful expression, without that greater spiritual excitement embracing them, or if all these are not sufficiently sunk into the soul, steeped in it, fused in it, and the expression does not come out purified and uplifted by a sort of spiritual transmutation, then we fall to lower levels of poetry and get work of a much more doubtful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. And when the appeal is altogether to the lower things in us, to the mere mind, we arrive outside the true domain of poetry; we approach the confines of prose or get prose itself masking in the apparent forms of poetry, and the work is distinguished from prose style only or mainly by its mechanical elements, a good verse form and perhaps a more compact, catching or energetic<span class='page-number' id='s-17' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.17]</span> expression than the prose writer will ordinarily permit to the easier and looser balance of his speech. It will not have at all or not sufficiently the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of poetry.\n\nFor in all things that speech can express there are two elements, the outward or instrumental and the real or spiritual. In thought, for instance, there is the intellectual idea, that which the intelligence makes precise and definite to us, and the soul-idea, that which exceeds the intellectual and brings us into nearness or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> with the whole reality of the thing expressed. Equally in emotion, it is not the mere emotion itself the poet seeks, but the soul of emotion, that in it for the delight of which the soul in us and the world <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> or accepts emotional experience. So too with the poetical sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, the poet's attempt to embody in his speech truth of life or truth of Nature. It is this greater truth and its delight and beauty for which he is seeking, beauty which is truth and truth beauty and therefore a joy for ever, because it brings us the delight of the soul in the discovery of its own deeper realities. This greater element the more timid and temperate speech of prose can sometimes shadow out to us, but the heightened and fearless style of poetry makes it close and living and the higher cadences of poetry carry in on their wings what the style by itself could not bring. This is the source of that intensity which is the stamp of poetical speech and of the poetical movement. It comes from the stress of the soul-vision behind the word; it is the spiritual excitement of a rhythmic voyage of self-discovery among the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> islands of form and name in these inner and outer worlds.<span class='page-number' id='s-18' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.18]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-essence-of-poetry","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Rhythm and Movement","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/rhythm-and-movement","prvt":"The Mantra","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-mantra","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["rhythm-and-movement"],"t":"Rhythm and Movement","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The mantra, poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the deepest spiritual reality, is only possible when three highest intensities of poetic speech meet and become indissolubly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>, a highest intensity of rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, a highest intensity of interwoven verbal form and thought-substance, of style, and a highest intensity of the soul's vision of truth. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> great poetry comes about by a unison of these three <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>; it is the insufficiency of one or another which makes the inequalities in the work of even the greatest poets, and it is the failure of some one element which is the cause of their lapses, of the scoriae in their work, the spots in the sun.

But it is not merely metrical rhythm, even in a perfect technical excellence, which we mean when we speak of poetic movement; that perfection is only a first step, a physical basis. There must be a deeper and more subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, a rhythmical soul-movement entering into the metrical form and often overflooding it before the real poetic achievement begins. A mere metrical excellence, however subtle, rich or varied, however perfectly it satisfies the outer ear, does not meet the deeper <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of the creative spirit; for there is an inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> which makes its greater claim, and to reach and satisfy it is the true aim of the creator of melody and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span>.\n\nNevertheless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span>, by which we mean a fixed and balanced system of the measures of sound, *mātrā*, is not only the<span class='page-number' id='s-19' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.19]</span> traditional, but also surely the right physical basis for the poetic movement. A recent modern tendency—that which has given us the poetry of Whitman and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span> and the experimentalists in *vers libre* in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span>,—denies this tradition and sets aside metre as a limiting bondage, perhaps even a frivolous artificiality or a falsification of true, free and natural poetic rhythm. That is, it seems to me, a point of view which cannot eventually prevail, because it does not deserve to prevail. It certainly cannot triumph, unless it justifies itself by supreme rhythmical achievements beside which the highest work of the great masters of poetic harmony in the past shall sink into a clear inferiority. That has not yet been done. On the contrary, *vers libre* has done its best when it has either limited its aim in rhythm to a kind of chanting poetical prose or else based itself on a sort of irregular and complex metrical movement which in its inner law, though not in its form, recalls the idea of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> choric poetry.\n\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> disparaging rhyme, which he had himself used with so much skill in his earlier, less sublime, but more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> poetry, forgot or ignored the spiritual value of rhyme, its power to enforce and clinch the appeal of melodic or harmonic recurrence which is a principal element in the measured movement of poetry, its habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> sealed doors to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to suggest and reveal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> to that supra-intellectual something in us which music is missioned to awake. The Whit manic technique falls into a similar, but wider error. When <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> found out the power of thought and feeling thrown into fixed and recurring measures of sound to move and take possession of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and soul, they were not discovering a mere artistic device, but a subtle truth of psychology, of which the conscious theory is preserved in the Vedic tradition. And when the ancient Indians chose more often than not to throw whatever they wished to endure, even philosophy, science and law, into metrical form, it was not merely to aid the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span>,—they were able to memorise huge prose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahmanas</span> quite as accurately as the Vedic hymnal or the metrical Upanishads,—but because they perceived that metrical speech has in itself not only an easier durability, but a greater natural power than<span class='page-number' id='s-20' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.20]</span> unmetrical, not only an intenser value of sound, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> to compel language and sense to heighten themselves in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to fall fitly into this stricter mould. There is perhaps a truth in the Vedic idea that the Spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> framed all the movements of the world by *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chandas</span>*, in certain fixed rhythms of the formative Word, and it is because they are faithful to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> metres that the basic world-movements unchangingly endure. A balanced harmony maintained by a system of subtle recurrences is the foundation of immortality in created things, and metrical movement is nothing else than creative sound grown conscious of this secret of its own powers.\n\nStill there are all sorts of heights and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> in the use of this power. General <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> seems indeed to have sanctioned the name of poetry for any kind of effective language set in a vigorous or catching metrical form, and although the wideness of this definition is such that it has enabled even the Macaulays and Kiplings to mount their queer poetic thrones, I will not object: catholicity is always a virtue. Nevertheless, mere force of language tacked on to the trick of the metrical beat does not answer the higher description of poetry; it may have the form or its shadow, it has not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>. There is a whole mass of poetry,—the French metrical romances and most of the mediaeval ballad poetry may be taken as examples,—which relies simply on the metrical beat for its rhythm and on an even level of just tolerable expression for its style; there is hardly a line whose rhythm floats home or where the expression strikes deep. Even in later <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European poetry</span>, though the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of verse and language has been better learned, essentially the same method persists, and poets who use it have earned not only the popular suffrage, but the praise of the critical mind. Still the definitive verdict on their verse is that it is nothing more than an effective jog-trot of Pegasus, a pleasing canter or a showy gallop. It has great staying-power,—indeed there seems no reason why, once begun, it should not go on for ever,—it carries the poet easily over his ground, but it does nothing more. Certainly, no real soul-movement can get easily into this mould. It has its merits and its powers; it is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> for metrical romances of a sort, for<span class='page-number' id='s-21' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.21]</span> war poetry and popular patriotic poetry, or perhaps any poetry which wants to be an \"echo of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>\"; it may stir, not the soul, but the vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> in us like a trumpet or excite it like a drum. But after all the drum and the trumpet do not carry us far in the way of music.\n\nBut even high above this level we still do not get at once the greater sound-movement of which we are speaking. Poets of considerable power, sometimes even the greatest in their less exalted moments, are satisfied ordinarily with a set harmony or a set melody, which is very satisfying to the outward ear and carries the aesthetic sense along with it in a sort of even, indistinctive pleasure, and into this mould of easy melody or harmony they throw their teeming or flowing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> without difficulty or check, without any need of an intenser heightening, a deeper appeal. It is beautiful poetry; it satisfies the aesthetic sense, the imagination and the ear; but there the charm ends. Once we have heard its rhythm, we have nothing new to expect, no surprise for the inner ear, no danger of the soul being suddenly seized and carried away into unknown depths. It is sure of being floated along evenly as if upon a flowing stream. Or sometimes it is not so much a flowing stream as a steady march or other even movement: this comes oftenest in poets who appeal more to the thought than to the ear; they are concerned chiefly with the thing they have to say and satisfied to have found an adequate rhythmic mould into which they can throw it without any farther preoccupation.\n\nBut even a great attention and skill in the use of metrical possibilities, in the invention of rhythmical turns, devices, modulations, variations, strong to satisfy the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, to seize the ear, to maintain its vigilant interest, will not bring us yet to the higher point we have in view. There are periods of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> in which this kind of skill is carried very far. The rhythms of Victorian poetry seem to me to be of this kind; they show sometimes the skill of the artist, sometimes of the classical or romantic technician, of the prestigious melodist or harmonist, sometimes the power of the vigorous craftsman or even the performer of robust metrical feats. All kinds of instrumental faculties have<span class='page-number' id='s-22' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.22]</span> been active; but the one thing that is lacking, except in moments or brief periods of inspiration, is the soul behind creating and listening to its own greater movements.\n\nPoetic rhythm begins to reach its highest levels, the greater poetic movements become possible when, using any of these powers but rising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> them, the soul begins to make its direct demand and yearn for a profounder satisfaction: they awake when the inner ear begins to listen. Technically, we may say that this comes in when the poet becomes, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>' phrase, a miser of sound and syllable, economical of his means, not in the sense of a niggardly sparing, but of making the most of all its possibilities of sound. It is then that poetry gets farthest away from the method of prose-rhythm. Proserhythm aims characteristically at a general harmony in which the parts are subdued to get the tone of a total effect; even the sounds which give the support or the relief, yet to a great extent seem to be trying to efface themselves in order not to disturb by a too striking particular effect the general harmony which is the whole aim. Poetry on the contrary makes much of its beats and measures; it seeks for a very definite and insistent rhythm. But still, where the greater rhythmical intensities are not pursued, it is only some total effect that predominates and the rest is subdued to it. But in these highest, intensest rhythms every sound is made the most of, whether in its suppression or in its swelling expansion, its narrowness or its open wideness, in order to get in the combined effect something which the ordinary harmonic flow of poetry cannot give us.\n\nBut this is only the technical side, the physical means by which the effect is produced. It is not the artistic intelligence or the listening physical ear that is most at work, but something within that is trying to bring out the echo of a hidden harmony, to discover a secret of rhythmic infinities within us. It is not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of the devising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> or the aesthetic sense which the poet has achieved, but a labour of the spirit within itself to cast something out of the surge of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> depths. The other faculties are there in their place, but the conductor of the<span class='page-number' id='s-23' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.23]</span> orchestral movement is the soul suddenly and potently coming forward to get its own work done by its own higher and unanalysable methods. The result is something as near to wordless music as word-music can get, and with the same power of soul-life, of soul-emotion, of profound supra-intellectual significance. In these higher harmonies and melodies the metrical rhythm is taken up by the spiritual; it is filled with or sometimes it seems rolled away and lost in a music that has really another unseizable and spiritual secret of movement.\n\nThis is the intensity of poetic movement out of which the greatest possibility of poetic expression arises. It is where the metrical movement remains as a base, but either enshrines and contains or is itself contained and floats in an element of greater music which exceeds it and yet brings out all its possibilities, that the music fit for the Mantra makes itself audible. It is the triumph of the embodied spirit over the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> and limitations of the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>. And the listener seems to be that other vaster and yet <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> eternal spirit whom the Upanishad speaks of as the ear of the ear, he who listens to all hearings; \"behind the instabilities of word and speech\" it is the profound inevitable harmonies of his own thought and vision for which he is listening.<span class='page-number' id='s-24' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.24]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/rhythm-and-movement","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Style and Substance","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/style-and-substance","prvt":"The Essence of Poetry","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-essence-of-poetry","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["style-and-substance"],"t":"Style and Substance","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Rhythm is the premier <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of poetical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> because it is the sound-movement which carries on its wave the thought-movement in the word; and it is the musical sound-image which most helps to fill in, to extend, subtilise and deepen the thought impression or the emotional or vital impression and to carry the sense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> itself into an expression of the intellectually inexpressible,—always the peculiar power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>. This truth was better understood on the whole or at least more consistently felt by the ancients than by the modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and ear, perhaps because they were more in the habit of singing, chanting or intoning their poetry while we are content to read ours, a habit which brings out the intellectual and emotional element, but unduly depresses the rhythmic value. On the other hand modern poetry has achieved a far greater subtlety, minute fineness and curious depth of suggestion in style and thought than was possible to the ancients,—at the price perhaps of some loss in power, height and simple largeness. The ancients would not so easily as the moderns have admitted into the rank of great poets writers of poor rhythmic faculty or condoned, ignored or praised in really great poets rhythmic lapses, roughnesses and crudities for the sake of their power of style and substance.\n\nIn regard to poetic style we have to make, for the purpose of the idea we have in view, the starting-point of the Mantra, precisely the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> as in regard to poetic rhythm,—since here too we find actually everything admitted as poetry which has some power of style and is cast into some kind of rhythmical form. But the question is, what kind of power and in that kind what intensity of achievement? There is plenty of poetry signed by poets of present reputation or lasting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> is obliged to consign to a border region of half-poetry,<span class='page-number' id='s-25' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.25]</span> because its principle of expression has not got far enough away from the principle of prose expression. It seems to forget that while the first aim of prose style is to define and fix an object, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, feeling, thought before the appreciating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> with whatever clearness, power, richness or other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of presentation may be added to that essential aim, the first aim of poetic style is to make the thing presented living to the imaginative vision, the responsive inner emotion, the spiritual sense, the soul-feeling and soul-sight. Where the failure is to express at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> with any sufficient power, to get home in any way, the distinction becomes palpable enough, and we readily say of such writings that this is verse but not poetry. But where there is some thought-power or other worth of substance attended with some power of expression, false values more easily become current and even a whole literary age may dwell on this borderland or be misled into an undue exaltation and cult for this half-poetry.\n\nPoetry, like the kindred arts of painting, sculpture, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span>, appeals to the spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> through significant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span>, and it makes no essential difference that in this case the image is mental and verbal and not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>. The essential power of the poetic word is to make us see, not to make us think or feel; thought and feeling[^1] must arise out of the sight or be included in it, but sight is the primary consequence and power of poetic speech. For the poet has to make us live in the soul and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner mind</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> what is ordinarily lived in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer mind</span> and the senses, and for that he must first make us see by the soul, in its light and with its deeper vision, what we ordinarily see in a more limited and halting fashion by the senses and the intelligence. He is, as the ancients knew, a seer and not merely a maker of rhymes, not merely a jongleur, rhapsodist or troubadour, and not merely a thinker in lines and stanzas. He sees beyond the sight of the surface mind and finds the revealing word, not merely the adequate and effective, but the illumined and illuminating, the<span class='page-number' id='s-26' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.26]</span> inspired and inevitable word, which compels us to see also. To arrive at that word is the whole endeavour of poetic style.\n\n[^1]: I speak here of the outer emotional or sensational feeling, not of the spiritual sense and soul-stir which is the invariable concomitant of the soul's sight.\n\nThe modern distinction is that the poet appeals to the imagination and not to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>. But there are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> kinds of imagination; the objective imagination which visualises strongly the outward aspects of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and things; the subjective imagination which visualises strongly the mental and emotional impressions they have the power to start in the mind; the imagination which deals in the play of mental fictions and to which we give the name of poetic fancy; the aesthetic imagination which delights in the beauty of words and images for their own sake and sees no farther. All these have their place in poetry, but they only give the poet his materials, they are only the first instruments in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of poetic style. The essential poetic imagination does not stop short with even the most subtle reproductions of things external or internal, with the richest or delicatest play of fancy or with the most <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> colouring of word or image. It is creative, not of either the actual or the fictitious, but of the more and the most real; it sees the spiritual truth of things,—of this truth too there are many <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span>,—which may take either the actual or the ideal for its starting-point. The aim of poetry, as of all true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, is neither a photographic or otherwise realistic imitation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, nor a romantic furbishing and painting or idealistic improvement of her image, but an interpretation by the images she herself affords us, not on one but on many planes of her creation, of that which she conceals from us, but is ready, when rightly approached, to reveal.\n\nThis is the true, because the highest and essential aim of poetry; but the human mind arrives at it only by a succession of steps, the first of which seems far enough from its object. It begins by stringing its most obvious and external ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and sensations of things on a thread of verse in a sufficient language of no very high quality. But even when it gets to a greater adequacy and effectiveness, it is often no more than a vital, an emotional or an intellectual adequacy and effectiveness. There is a strong vital poetry which powerfully appeals to our sensations and our sense of life, like much of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> or the less inspired<span class='page-number' id='s-27' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.27]</span> mass of the Elizabethan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span>; a strong emotional poetry which stirs our feelings and gives us the sense and active image of the passions; a strong intellectual poetry which satisfies our curiosity about life and its mechanism, or deals with its psychological and other \"problems\", or shapes for us our thoughts in an effective, striking and often quite resistlessly quotable fashion. All this has its pleasures for the mind and the surface soul in us, and it is certainly quite legitimate to enjoy them and to enjoy them strongly and vividly on our way upward; but if we rest content with these only, we shall never get very high up the hill of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Muses</span>.\n\nThe style of such poetry corresponds usually to its substance; for between the word and the vision there tends to be, though there is not by any means perfectly or invariably, a certain equation. There is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of vital style, a force of emotional style, a force of intellectual style which we meet constantly in poetry and which it is essential to distinguish from the language of the higher spiritual imagination. The forceful expression of thought and sentiment is not enough for this higher language. To take some examples, it is not enough for it to express its sense of world-sorrow in a line of cheap sentimental force like Byron's\n\n>There's not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> the world can give like that it takes away,\n\nor to voice an opposite truth in the sprightly-forcible manner of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span>'s\n\n><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s in his heaven,\nAll's right with the world,\n\nor to strike the balance in a sense of equality with the pointed and ever quotable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> of Pope's\n\n>God sees with equal eyes as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of all\nA hero perish or a sparrow fall.\n\nThis may be the poetical or half-poetical language of thought and sentiment; it is not the language of real poetic vision. Note that all three brush the skirts of ideas whose deeper expression from the vision of a great poet might touch the very<span class='page-number' id='s-28' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.28]</span> heights of poetic revelation. Byron's line is the starting-point in the emotional sensations for that high world-pessimism and its spiritual release which finds expression in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>'s\n\n>*Anityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām;[^2]*\n\n[^2]: \"Thou who hast come to this transient and unhappy world, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and turn to Me.\"\n\nand one has only to compare the manner of the two in style and rhythm, even leaving the substance aside, to see the difference between the lesser and the greater poetry. Browning's language rises from a robust <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cheerfulness</span> of temperament, it does not touch the deeper fountain-heads of truth in us; an opposite temperament may well smile at it as vigorous optimistic fustian. Pope's actually falsifies by its poetical inadequacy that great truth of the Gita's teaching, the truth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> equality, because he has not seen and therefore cannot make us see; his significant images of the truth are, like his perception of it, intellectual and rhetorical, not poetic figures.\n\nThere is a higher style of poetry than this which yet falls below the level to which we have to climb. It is no longer poetical language of a merely intellectual, vital or emotional force, but instead or in addition a genuinely imaginative style, with a certain, often a great beauty of vision in it, whether objective or subjective, or with a certain, often a great but indefinite soul-power bearing up its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of word and rhythm. It varies in intensity: for the lower intensity we can get plenty of examples from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span>, when he is indulging his imagination rather than his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span>, and at a higher pitch from Spenser; for the loftier intensity we can cite at will for one kind from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>'s early poetry, for another from poets who have a real spiritual vision like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> and Shelley. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry runs, indeed, ordinarily in this mould. But this too is not that highest intensity of the revelatory poetic word from which the Mantra starts. It has a certain power of revelation in it, but the deeper vision is still coated up in something more external; sometimes the poetic intention of decorative beauty, sometimes some other deliberate intention of the poetic mind overlays with the more outward<span class='page-number' id='s-29' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.29]</span> beauty, beauty of image, beauty of thought, beauty of emotion, the deeper intention of the spirit within, so that we have still to look for that beyond the image rather than are seized by it through the image. A high pleasure is there, not unspiritual in its nature, but still it is not that point where pleasure passes into or is rather drowned in the pure spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of the creative, poetic revelation.\n\nThat intensity comes where everything else may be present, but all is powerfully carried on the surge of a spiritual vision which has found its inspired and inevitable speech. All or any of the other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> may be there, but they are at once subordinated and transfigured to their highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> for poetic light and rapture. This intensity belongs to no particular style, depends on no conceivable formula of diction. It may be the height of the decorative imaged style as often we find it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kalidasa</span> or Shakespeare; it may be that height of bare and direct expression where language seems to be used as a scarcely felt vaulting board for a leap into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>; it may be the packed intensity of language which uses either the bare or the imaged form at will, but fills every word with its utmost possible rhythmic and thought suggestion. But in itself it depends on none of these things; it is not a style, but poetic style itself, the Word; it creates and carries with it its elements rather than is created by them. Whatever its outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, it is always the one fit style for the Mantra.<span class='page-number' id='s-30' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.30]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/style-and-substance","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Poetic Vision and the Mantra","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/poetic-vision-and-the-mantra","prvt":"Rhythm and Movement","prvu":"/cwsa/26/rhythm-and-movement","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["poetic-vision-and-the-mantra"],"t":"Poetic Vision and the Mantra","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"This highest intensity of style and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which is the crest of the poetical impulse in its self-expression, the point at which the aesthetic, the vital, the intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of poetic speech pass into the spiritual, justifies itself perfectly when it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of a deep, high or wide spiritual vision into which the life-sense, the thought, the emotion, the appeal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> in the thing discovered and in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>—for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> great poetic utterance is discovery,—rise on the wave of the culminating poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and pass into an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of sight.

In classical Sanskrit it is applied to any maker of verse or even of prose, but in the Vedic it meant the poet-seer who saw the Truth and found in a subtle truth-hearing the inspired word of his vision.\n\nTherefore the greatest poets have been always those who have had a large and powerful interpretative and intuitive vision of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and whose poetry has arisen out of that in a supreme revelatory utterance of it. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span>, Shakespeare, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span>, Valmiki, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kalidasa</span>, however much they may differ in everything else, are at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> in having this as the fundamental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of their greatness. Their supremacy does not lie essentially in a greater thought-power or a more lavish imagery or a more penetrating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of passion and emotion; these things they may have had, one being more gifted in one direction, another in others, but these other powers were aids to their poetic expression rather than its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> or its source. There is often more thought in a short essay of Bacon's than in a whole play of Shakespeare's, but not even a hundred cryptograms can make him the author of the dramas; for, as he showed when he tried to write poetry, the very nature of his thought-power and the characteristic way of expression of the born philosophic thinker hampered him in poetic expression. It was the constant outstreaming of form and thought and image from an abundant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner vision</span> of life which made Shakespeare, whatever his other deficiencies, the sovereign dramatic poet. Sight is the essential poetic gift. The archetypal poet in a world of original ideas is, we may say, a Soul that sees in itself intimately this world and all the others and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and Nature and the life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> and sets flowing from its centre a surge of creative rhythm and word-images which become the expressive body of the vision. The great poets are those who repeat in some measure this ideal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, *kavayaḥ satyasśrutaḥ*, seers of the poetic truth and hearers of its word.\n\nThe tendency of the modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> at the present day seems to be towards laying a predominant value on the thought in poetry. We live still in an age which is in a great intellectual trouble and ferment about life and the world and is developing enormously the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>,—often at the expense of<span class='page-number' id='s-32' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.32]</span> other powers which are no less necessary to self-knowledge,—in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to grapple with life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> it. We are seeking always and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> directions to decipher the enigma of things, the cryptogram of the worlds which we are set to read, and to decipher it by the aid of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>; and for the most part we are much too busy living and thinking to have leisure to be silent and see. We expect the poet to use his great mastery of language to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> us in this endeavour; we ask of him not so much perfect beauty of song or largeness of creative vision as a message to our perplexed and seeking intellects. Therefore we hear constantly today of the \"philosophy\" of a poet, even the most inveterate beautifier of commonplaces being forcibly gifted by his admirers with a philosophy, or of his message,—the message of Tagore, the message of Whitman. We are asking then of the poet to be, not a supreme singer or an inspired seer of the worlds, but a philosopher, a prophet, a teacher, even something perhaps of a religious or ethical preacher. It is necessary therefore to say that when I claim for the poet the role of a seer of Truth and find the source of great poetry in a great and revealing vision of life or God or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> or man or Nature, I do not mean that it is necessary for him to have an intellectual philosophy of life or a message for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, which he chooses to express in verse because he has the metrical gift and the gift of imagery, or that he must give us a solution of the problems of the age, or come with a mission to improve <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>, or, as it is said, \"to leave the world better than he found it.\" As a man, he may have these things, but the less he allows them to get the better of his poetic gift, the happier it will be for his poetry. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Material</span> for his poetry they may give, an influence in it they may be, provided they are transmuted into vision and life by the poetic spirit, but they can be neither its soul nor its aim, nor give the law to its creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and its expression.\n\nThe poet-seer sees differently, thinks in another way, voices himself in quite another manner than the philosopher or the prophet. The prophet announces the Truth as the Word, the Law or the command of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>, he is the giver of the message; the poet shows us Truth in its power of beauty, in its symbol or<span class='page-number' id='s-33' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.33]</span> image, or reveals it to us in the workings of Nature or in the workings of life, and when he has done that, his whole work is done; he need not be its explicit spokesman or its official messenger. The philosopher's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> is to discriminate Truth and put its parts and aspects into intellectual relation with each other; the poet's is to seize and embody aspects of Truth in their living relations, or rather—for that is too philosophical a language—to see her features and, excited by the vision, create in the beauty of her image.\n\nNo doubt, the prophet may have in him a poet who breaks out often into speech and surrounds with the vivid atmosphere of life the directness of his message; he may follow up his injunction \"Take no thought for the morrow,\" by a revealing image of the beauty of the truth he enounces, in the life of Nature, in the figure of the lily, or link it to human life by apologue and parable. The philosopher may bring in the aid of colour and image to give some relief and hue to his dry light of reason and water his arid path of abstractions with some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>healing</span> dew of poetry. But these are ornaments and not the substance of his work; and if the philosopher makes his thought substance of poetry, he ceases to be a philosophic thinker and becomes a poet-seer of Truth. Thus the more rigid metaphysicians are perhaps right in denying to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nietzsche</span> the name of philosopher; for Nietzsche does not think, but always sees, turbidly or clearly, rightly or distortedly, but with the eye of the seer rather than with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of the thinker. On the other hand we may get great poetry which is full of a prophetic enthusiasm of utterance or is largely or even wholly philosophic in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>; but this prophetic poetry gives us no direct message, only a mass of sublime inspirations of thought and image, and this philosophic poetry is poetry and lives as poetry only in so far as it departs from the method, the expression, the way of seeing proper to the philosophic mind. It must be vision pouring itself into thought-images and not thought trying to observe truth and distinguish its province and bounds and fences.\n\nIn earlier days this distinction was not at all clearly understood and therefore we find even poets of great power attempting<span class='page-number' id='s-34' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.34]</span> to set philosophic systems to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> or even much more prosaic matter than a philosophic system, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hesiod</span> and Virgil setting about even a manual of agriculture in verse! In Rome, always a little blunt of perception in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span>, her two greatest poets fell a victim to this unhappy conception, with results which are a lesson and a warning to all posterity. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lucretius</span>' work lives only, in spite of the majestic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> behind it, by its splendid digressions into pure poetry, Virgil's *Georgics* by fine passages and pictures of Nature and beauties of word and image; but in both the general substance is lifeless matter which has floated to us on the stream of Time, saved only by the beauty of its setting. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, and perhaps India alone, managed once or twice to turn this kind of philosophic attempt into a poetic success, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, in the Upanishads and some minor works modelled upon them. But the difference is great. The Gita owes its poetical success to its starting from a great and critical situation in life, its constant keeping of that in view and always returning upon it, and to its method which is to seize on a spiritual experience or moment or stage of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and throw it into the form of thought; and this, though a delicate operation, can well abide within the limits of the poetic manner of speech. Only where it overburdens itself with metaphysical matter and deviates into sheer philosophic definition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span>, which happens especially in two or three of its closing chapters, does the poetic voice sink under the weight, even occasionally into flattest versified prose. The Upanishads too, and much more, are not at all philosophic thinking, but spiritual seeing; these ancient stanzas are a rush of spiritual intuitions, flames of a burning fire of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> experience, waves of an inner sea of light and life, and they throw themselves into the language and cadence of poetry because that is their natural speech and a more intellectual utterance would have falsified their vision.\n\nNowadays we have clarified our aesthetic perceptions sufficiently to avoid the mistake of the Roman poets; but in a subtler form the intellectual tendency still shows a dangerous spirit of encroachment. For the impulse to teach is upon us, the inclination to be an observer and critic of life,—there could<span class='page-number' id='s-35' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.35]</span> be no more perilous definition than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arnold</span>'s poetic \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span> of life\", in spite of the saving epithet,—to clothe, merely, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of poetry a critical or philosophic idea of life to the detriment of our vision. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Allegory</span> with its intellectual ingenuities, its facile wedding of the abstract idea and the concrete image, shows a tendency to invade again the domain of poetry. And there are other signs of the intellectual malady of which we are almost all of us the victims. Therefore it is well to insist that the native power of poetry is in its sight, not in its intellectual thought-matter, and its safety is in adhering to this native principle of vision; its conception, its thought, its emotion, its presentation, its structure must rise out of that or else rise into it before it takes its finished form. The poetic vision of things is not a criticism of life, not an intellectual or philosophic view of it, but a soul-view, a seizing by the inner sense. The Mantra too is not in its substance or its form a poetic enunciation of philosophic verities, but a rhythmic revelation or intuition arising out of the soul's sight of God and Nature and itself and of the world and of the inner truth—occult to the outward eye—of all that peoples it, the secrets of their life and being.\n\nIn the attempt to fix the view of life which Art must take, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> are constantly laid down, such as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a subjective or an objective treatment or of a realistic or an idealistic view, which mislead more than they enlighten. Certainly, one poet may seem to excel in the concrete presentation of things and falter or be less sure in his grasp of the purely subjective, while another may move freely in the more subjective worlds and be less at home in the concrete; and both may be poets of a high order. But when we look closer, we see that just as a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objectivity</span> is necessary to make poetry live and the thing seen stand out before our eyes, so on the other hand even the most objective presentation starts from an inner view and subjective process of creation or at least a personal interpretation and transmutation of the thing seen. The poet really creates out of himself and not out of what he sees outwardly: that outward seeing only serves to excite the inner vision to its work. Otherwise his work would<span class='page-number' id='s-36' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.36]</span> be a mechanical construction and putting together, not a living creation.\n\nSheer objectivity brings us down from art to photography; and the attempt to diminish the subjective view to the vanishing-point so as to get an accurate presentation is proper to science, not to poetry. We are not thereby likely to get a greater truth or reality, but very much the reverse; for the scientific presentation of things, however valid in its own domain, that of the senses and the observing reason, is not true to the soul. It is not the integral truth or the whole vision of things, for it gives only their process and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> and mechanic law, but not their inner life and spirit. That is the error in realism,—in its theory, at least, for its practice is something other than what it intends or pretends to be. Realistic art does not and cannot give us a scientifically accurate presentation of life, because Art is not and cannot be Science. What it does do, is to make an arbitrary selection of motives, forms and hues, here of dull blues and greys and browns and dingy whites and sordid yellows, there of violent blacks and reds, and the result is sometimes a thing of power and sometimes a nightmare. Idealistic art makes a different selection and produces either a work of nobly-coloured power or soft-hued beauty or else a high-pitched and false travesty or a specious day-dream. In these distinctions there is no safety; nor can any rule be laid down for the poet, since he must necessarily go by what he is and what he sees, except that he should work from the living poetic centre within him and not exile himself into artificial standpoints.\n\nFrom our present point of view we may say that the poet may do as he pleases in all that is not the essential matter. Thought-matter may be prominent in his work or life-substance predominate. He may proceed by sheer force of presentation or by direct power of interpretation. He may make this world his text, or wander into regions <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, or soar straight into the pure empyrean of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>. To arrive at the Mantra he may start from the colour of a rose, or the power or beauty of a character, or the splendour of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, or go away from all these into his own secret soul and its most hidden movements.<span class='page-number' id='s-37' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.37]</span> The one thing needful is that he should be able to go beyond the word or image he uses or the form of the thing he sees, not be limited by them, but get into the light of that which they have the power to reveal and flood them with it until they overflow with its suggestions or seem even to lose themselves and disappear into the revelation and the apocalypse. At the highest he himself disappears into sight; the personality of the seer is lost in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span> of the vision, and the Spirit of all seems alone to be there speaking out sovereignly its own secrets.\n\nBut the poetic vision, like everything else, follows necessarily the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of the human mind and according to the age and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, it has its ascents and descents, its high levels and its low returns. Ordinarily, it follows the sequence of an abrupt <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> pushing to a rapid decline. The eye of early man is turned upon the physical world about him, the interest of the story of life and its primary ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>; he sees man and his world only, or he sees the other worlds and their gods and beings, but it is still his own physical world in a magnified and heightened image. He asks little of poetry except a more forceful vision of familiar things, things real and things commonly imagined, which will help him to see them more largely and feel them more strongly and give him a certain inspiration to live them more powerfully. Next,—but this transition is sometimes brief or even quite overleaped,—there comes a period in which he feels the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and curiosity and rich adventure of the expanding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> within him, the passion and romance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and it is this in all its vivid colour that he expects art and poetry to express and satisfy him through the imagination and the emotions with its charm and power. Afterwards he begins to intellectualise, but still on the same subject-matter; he asks now from the poet a view of things enlightened by the inspired reason and beautifully shaped by the first strong and clear joy of his developed aesthetic sense. A vital poetry appealing to the imagination through the sense-mind and the emotions and a poetry interpretative of life to the intelligence are the fruit of these ages. A later poetry tends always to return on these forms with a more subtilised intellect and a richer life-experience. But, having got so far, it can go no<span class='page-number' id='s-38' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.38]</span> farther and there is the beginning of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span>.\n\nGreat things may be done by poetry within these limits and the limited lifetime it gives to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>; but it is evident that the poet will have a certain difficulty in getting to a deeper vision, because he has to lean entirely on the external thought and form; he must be subservient to them because they are the only safe support he knows, and he gets at what truth he can that may be beyond them with their veil still thickly interposing between him and a greater light. A higher level can come, bringing with it the possibility of a renewed and prolonged course for the poetic impulse, if the mind of man begins to see more intimately the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> behind life, the powers concealed by our subjective existence. The poet can attempt to reveal these unsuspected ranges and motives and use the outward physical and vital and thought symbol only as a suggestion of greater things. Yet a higher level can be attained, deeper depths, larger horizons when the soul in things comes nearer to man or when other worlds than the physical open themselves to him. And the entire <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> of the poetic vision to see most profoundly and the poetic power to do its highest work will arrive when the spiritual itself is the possession of the greatest minds and the age stands on the verge of its revelation.\n\nTherefore it is not sufficient for poetry to attain high intensities of word and rhythm; it must have, to fill them, an answering intensity of vision and always new and more and more uplifted or inward ranges of experience. And this does not depend only on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> power of vision of the poet, but on the mind of his age and country, its level of thought and experience, the adequacy of its symbols, the depth of its spiritual attainment. A lesser poet in a greater age may give us occasionally things which exceed in this kind the work of less favoured immortals. The religious poetry of the later Indian tongues has for us fervours of poetic revelation which in the great classics are absent, even though no mediaeval poet can rank in power with Valmiki and Kalidasa. The modern literatures of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> commonly fall short of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> perfection of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and form, but they give us what the greatest Greek poets had not and could not have. And<span class='page-number' id='s-39' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.39]</span> in our own days a poet of secondary power in his moments of inspiration can get to a vision far more satisfying to the deepest soul within us than Shakespeare's or Dante's. Greatest of all is the promise of the age that is coming, if the race fulfils its highest and largest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> possibilities and does not founder in a vitalistic bog or remain tied in the materialistic paddock; for it will be an age in which all the worlds are beginning to withdraw their screens from man's gaze and invite his experience, and he will be near to the revelation of the Spirit of which they are, as we choose, the obscuring veils, the significant forms and symbols or else the transparent raiment. It is as yet uncertain to which of these consummations <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> is leading us.<span class='page-number' id='s-40' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.40]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/poetic-vision-and-the-mantra","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The National Evolution of Poetry","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-national-evolution-of-poetry","prvt":"Style and Substance","prvu":"/cwsa/26/style-and-substance","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-national-evolution-of-poetry"],"t":"The National Evolution of Poetry","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The work of the poet depends not only on himself and his age, but on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> to which he belongs and the spiritual, intellectual, aesthetic tradition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> which it creates for him.

At once sustaining and limiting the weaker spirits, they give to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> an exceptional power for sustained <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of form and a satisfying perfection. But this is no essential condition for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of great poetry. The poet, we must always remember, creates out of himself and has the indefeasible right to follow freely the breath of the spirit within him, provided he satisfies in his work the law of poetic beauty. The external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of his age and his nation only give him his starting-point and some of his materials and determine to some extent, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, by a subconscious and automatic environmental pressure, the room he finds for the free play of his poetic spirit.\n\nNor is it necessary to subscribe to the theory of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and his milieu or the dogma of the historical school of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span> which asks of us to study all the precedents, circumstances, influences,<span class='page-number' id='s-41' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.41]</span> surroundings, all that \"created\" the man and his work,—as if there were not something in him apart from these which made all the difference, something that made him a man apart and not like others. It is supposed that out of this elaborate scientific study the right estimate of his poetry will arise. But even the right historical or psychological understanding of him need not inevitably arise out of this method; for we may very easily read into him and his work things which may perhaps have been there in front of him or around him, but never really got inside him. And the right estimate of his work we certainly shall not form if we bring in so much that is accidental and unessential to cloud our free and direct impression. Rather the very opposite is the true method of appreciation; we have to go straight to the poet and his poem for all we need essentially to know about them,—we shall get there all that we really want for any true aesthetic or poetic purpose. Afterwards we can go elsewhere, if we like, for any minor elucidations or rummage about laboriously to satisfy our scientific and historical curiosity. In this more natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> things accidental are much more likely to fall into their right place and the freshness and authenticity of our poetic appreciation have some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of remaining unobscured and still vibrant. But quite apart from its external and therefore unreal method, there is a truth in the historical theory of criticism which is of real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> towards grasping something that is important and even essential, if not for our poetic appreciation, yet for our intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> of a poet and his work.\n\nIn poetry, as in everything else that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> at perfection, there are always two elements, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> true substance and the limitations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>accidents</span> brought in by the time element. The first alone really and always matters, and it is that which must determine our definitive appreciation, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> verdict, or rather our essential response to poetry. A soul expressing the eternal spirit of Truth and Beauty through some of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> variations of beauty, with the word for its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, that is, after all, what the poet is, and it is to a similar soul in us seeking the same spirit and responding to it that he makes his appeal. It is when we can get this response at its purest and in its most<span class='page-number' id='s-42' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.42]</span> direct and heightened awakening that our faculty of poetic appreciation becomes at once surest and most intense. It is, we may say, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> enjoyer of creative beauty in us responding to the impersonal creator and interpreter of beauty in the poet. For it is the impersonal spirit of Truth and Beauty that is seeking to express itself through his personality; and it is that and not his personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> which finds its own word and seems itself to create through him in his highest moments of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. And this Impersonal is concerned only with the creative idea and the motive of beauty which is seeking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>; its sole purpose is to find the perfect expression, the inevitable word and the rhythm that reveals. All else is subordinate, accidental, the crude <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> and the conditioning medium of this essential endeavour.\n\nStill there is also the personality of the poet and the personality of the hearer; the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> gives the pitch and the form of the success arrived at, the other determines the characteristic intellectual and aesthetic judgment to which its appeal arrives. The correspondence or the dissonance between the two decides the relation between the poet and his reader, and out of that arises whatever is personal in our appreciation and judgment of his poetry. In this personal or time element there is always much that is merely accidental and this rather limits and deflects our judgment than helps usefully to form it. How much it interferes can be seen when we try to value contemporary poetry.[^1] It is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of continual experience that even critics of considerable insight and sureness of taste are yet capable of the most extraordinarily wrong judgments, whether on the side of appreciation or of depreciation, when they have to pass a verdict on their contemporaries. And this is because a crowd of accidental influences belonging to the effect of the time and the mental environment upon our mentality exercise an exaggerated domination and distort or colour the view of our mental eye<span class='page-number' id='s-43' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.43]</span> upon its object. But apart from this disabling intrusion there is always something essential to our present personality which is of more value and has a right to be heard. For we are all of us souls developing our unfinished <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> in a constant endeavour to get into unity with the spirit in life through its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> and on many different lines. And as there is in Indian Yoga a principle of varying <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, *adhikāra*, something in the immediate power of a man's nature that determines by its characteristics his right to this or that way of Yoga, of union with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span>, which, whatever its merits or its limitations, is his right way because it is most helpful to him personally, so in all our activities of life and mind there is this principle of *adhikāra*. That which we can appreciate in poetry and still more the way in which we appreciate it, is that in it and us which is most helpful to us and therefore, for the time <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> at least, right for us in our attempt to get into union either with universal or transcendent Beauty through the revealing ideas and motives and suggestive forms of poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>.\n\n[^1]: Or even the poetry that has just preceded us, e.g. the nineteenth century's contemptuous estimate of the eighteenth or the twentieth century's equally contemptuous dismissal of the fallen Victorian demigods.\n\nThis is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> aspect of the personal or time element. But there is also a larger <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> to which we belong, ourselves and the poet and his poetry; or rather it is the same movement of the general soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> in the same endeavour as the individual's and towards the same objective. In poetry this shows itself in a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> from the objective to the inward and from the inward to the inmost, the spiritual,—an evolution which has many curves and turns and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cycles</span>, many returns upon past motives and imperfect anticipations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> motives, but is on the whole and up to a certain point a growth and progress, a constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of self-enlargement and self-finding. It is a clear idea of this evolution which may most helpfully inform the historical element in our judgment and appreciation of poetry; it is a judgment of it from the viewpoint of the evolution of the human spirit and the subtler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and larger experience which that progress brings. We can see this general movement working itself out in different forms and on different lines through the souls of the nations and peoples, not so many after all, who have arrived at a strong self-expression<span class='page-number' id='s-44' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.44]</span> through the things of the mind, through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and thought and poetry. These things of the mind do not indeed form or express the whole of the movement, even as they do not make up the whole of the life of the people; they represent its highest points,—or in the two or three peoples that have powerfully developed the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> within, the highest with the exception of the spiritual summit. In these few we can best see the inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and aim of any one line of the movement,—whether it be the line of poetry, the line of art or the line of religious and spiritual endeavour.\n\nThis general evolution has its own natural periods or ages; but as with the stone, bronze and other ages discovered by the archaeologists, their time periods do not always correspond, are not the same for all the peoples which have evolved them. Moreover, they do not always follow each other in quite the same rigorous order; there are occasional reversals, extraordinary anticipations, violent returns; for in things psychological the Spirit in the world varies its movements more freely than in physical things. There, besides, the spirit of the race can anticipate the motives of a higher stratum of psychological development while yet it lives outwardly the general life of a lower stratum. So too when it has got well on to a higher level of development, it may go strongly back to a past and inferior motive and see how that works out when altered and uplifted or enlarged or even only subtilised by the motives and powers of the superior medium. There is here, besides, a greater complexity of unseen or half-seen subconscient and superconscient tendencies and influences at work upon the comparatively small part of us which is conscious of what it is doing. And very often a nation in its labour of self-expression is both helped and limited by what has been left behind from the evolution of a past self which, being dead, yet lives.\n\nThus, the Indian spirit could seize powerfully the spiritual motive in an age in which the mass of the people lived a strenuous external life and was strongly outward-going and objective in its normal mentality. It succeeded in expressing the supreme spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>, so difficult to put at all into speech, in forms<span class='page-number' id='s-45' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.45]</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> proper to the simplest physical life and the most external customary mentality converting them into physical symbols of the supraphysical and then, by a rapid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, in its own proper voice, so producing the sacred poetry of the Veda and Upanishads. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> with the Graeco-Roman past in its blood could seize intellectually on the motives of catholic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span> and give them a precise and supremely poetic expression in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span>, while all Germanised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> was still stammering its primitive thoughts in the faltering infantile accents of romance verse or shadowing them out in Gothic stone, successful only in the most material form of the spiritual. In another direction, when it seized upon the romantic life-motive, the meeting-place of the Teuton and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Celt</span>, we see it losing entirely the mystically sentimental Celtic element, Italianising it into the sensuousness of Tasso, and Italianising the rest into an intellectualised, a half imaginative, half satiric play with the superficial motives of romance,—the inevitable turn of the Italianised Roman spirit. On the other hand the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> spirit, having got rid of the Latin culture and holding the Celtic mind for a long time at bay, exiled into the Welsh mountains or parked <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the pale in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ireland</span>, followed with remarkable fidelity the natural curve and stages of the psychological evolution of poetry, taking several centuries to arrive at the intellectual motive and more to get at something like a spiritual turn still too intellectualised to find any absolute intensity of the spirit, only the first shimmerings of an outbreak of vision.\n\nGenerally, every nation or people has or develops a spirit in its being, a special soul-form of the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all-soul</span> and a law of its nature which determines the lines and turns of its evolution. All that it takes from its environment it naturally attempts to assimilate to this spirit, transmute into stuff of this soul-form, make apt to and governable by this law of its nature. All its self-expression is in conformity with them. And its poetry, art and thought are the expression of this self and of the greater possibilities of its self to which it moves. The individual poet and his poetry are part of its movement. Not that they are limited by the present temperament and outward forms of the national<span class='page-number' id='s-46' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.46]</span> mind; they may exceed them. The soul of the poet may be like a star and dwell apart; even, his work may seem not merely a variation from but a revolt against the limitations of the national mind. But still the roots of his personality are there in its spirit and even his variation and revolt are an attempt to bring out something that is latent and suppressed or at least something which is trying to surge up from the secret all-soul into the soul-form of the nation. Therefore to appreciate this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national evolution</span> of poetry and the relations of the poet and his work with it cannot but be fruitful, if we observe them from the point of view not so much of things external to poetry, but of its own spirit and characteristic forms and motives.<span class='page-number' id='s-47' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.47]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-national-evolution-of-poetry","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Character of English Poetry - I","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-character-of-english-poetry-i","prvt":"Poetic Vision and the Mantra","prvu":"/cwsa/26/poetic-vision-and-the-mantra","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-character-of-english-poetry-i"],"t":"The Character of English Poetry - I","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the modern European tongues the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language—I think this may be said without any serious doubt,—has produced, not always the greatest or most perfect, but at least the most rich and naturally powerful poetry, the most lavish of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and innate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>. The unfettered play of poetic energy and power has been here the most abundant and brought forth the most constantly brilliant fruits.

The poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of Greece and Rome has pervaded and largely shaped the whole artistic production of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italian poetry</span> of the great age has thrown on some part of it at least a stamp only less profound; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French prose</span> and poetry—but the latter in a much less degree,—have helped more than any other literary influence to form the modern turn of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European mind</span> and its mode of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>; the shortlived outbursts of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative power</span> in the Spain of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Calderón</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span> exercised an immediate, a strong, though not an enduring influence; the newly created Russian literature has been, though more subtly, among the most intense of recent cultural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>.

This insularity, not of reception but of reaction, is a marked phenomenon and calls for explanation.\n\nIf we look for the causes,—for such a paucity of influence cannot, certainly, be put down to any perversity or obtuseness in the general mind of Europe, but must be due to some insufficiency or serious defect in the literature,—we shall find, I think, if we look with other than English-trained eyes, that there is even in this rich and vigorous poetry abundant cause for the failure. English poetry is powerful but it is imperfect, strong in spirit, but uncertain and tentative in form; it is extraordinarily stimulating, but not often quite satisfying. It <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> high, but its success is not as great as its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>. Especially, its imaginative force exceeds its thought-power; it has indeed been hardly at all a really great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of poetic thought-vision; it has not dealt fruitfully with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. Its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> has been more a succession of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> poetic achievements than a constant national tradition; in the mass it has been a series of poetical revolutions without any strong inner continuity. That is to say that it has had no great self-recognising idea or view of life expressive of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> or powerful to determine from an early time its own sufficient artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>. But it is precisely the possession of such a self-recognising spiritual attitude and the attainment of a satisfying artistic form for it which make the poetry of a nation a power in the world's general culture. For that which recognises its self will most readily be recognised by others. And, again, that which attains the perfect form of its own innate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, will be most effective in forming others and leave its stamp in the building of the general mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>.\n\nOne or two examples will be sufficient to show the vast difference. No poetry has had so powerful an influence as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span><span class='page-number' id='s-49' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.49]</span> poetry; no poetry is, I think, within its own limits so perfect and satisfying. The limits indeed are marked and even, judged by the undulating many-sidedness and wideness of the modern mind, narrow; but on its own lines this poetry works with a flawless power and sufficiency. From beginning to end it dealt with life from one large view-point; it worked always from the inspired reason, used a luminous intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> and harmonised all it did by the rule of an enlightened and chastened aesthetic sense; whatever changes overtook it, it never departed from this motive and method which are the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the Greek spirit. And of this motive it was very conscious and by its clear recognition of it and fidelity to it was able to achieve an artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and sufficiency of expressive form which affect us like an easily accomplished miracle and which have been the admiration of after ages. Even the poetry of the Greek <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span> preserved enough of this power to act as a shaping influence on Latin literature.\n\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French poetry</span> is much more limited than the Greek, much less powerful in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. For it deals with life from the standpoint not of the inspired reason, but of the clear-thinking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, not of the enlightened aesthetic sense, but of emotional sentiment. These are its two constant powers; the one gives it its brain-stuff, the other its poetical fervour and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> and charm and appeal. Throughout all the changes of the last century, in spite of apparent cultural revolutions, the French spirit has remained in its poetry faithful to these two motives which are of its very essence, and because of this fidelity it has always or almost always found for its work a satisfying and characteristic form. To that combination of a clear and strong motive and a satisfying form it owes the immense influence it has exercised from time to time on other European literatures. The cultural power of the poetry of other tongues may be traced to similar causes. But what has been the distinct spirit and distinguishing form of English poetry? Certainly, there is an English spirit which could not fail to be reflected in its poetry; but, not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> clearly self-conscious, it is reflected obscurely and confusedly, and it has been at war within itself, followed a fluctuation of different<span class='page-number' id='s-50' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.50]</span> motives and never succeeded in bringing about between them a conciliation and fusion. Therefore its form has suffered; it has had indeed no native and characteristic principle of form which would be, through all changes, the outward reflection of a clear self-recognising spirit.\n\nThe poetry of a nation is only one side of its self-expression and its characteristics may be best understood if we look at it in relation to the whole mental and dynamic effort of the people. If we so look at the general contribution of the English nation to human life and culture, the eye is arrested by some remarkable lacunae. These are especially profound in the arts: English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> is a zero, English sculpture an unfilled void, English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span> only a little better;[^1] English painting, illustrated by a few great names, has been neither a great artistic tradition nor a powerful cultural force and merits only a casual mention by the side of the rich achievement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span>, Spain, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Holland</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Belgium</span>. When we come to the field of thought we get a mixed impression like that of great mountain eminences towering out of a very low and flat plain. We find great individual philosophers, but no great philosophical tradition, two or three remarkable thinkers, but no high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> for thinking, a great multitude of the most famous names in science, but no national scientific culture. Still in these fields there has been remarkable accomplishment and the influence on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> has been frequently considerable and sometimes capital. But when finally we turn to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of practical life, there is an unqualified preeminence: in mechanical science and invention, in politics, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> and industry, in colonisation, travel, exploration, in the domination of earth and the exploitation of its riches <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> has been till late largely, sometimes entirely the world's leader, the creator of its forms and the shaper of its motives.\n\n[^1]: Outside the Gothic, and even there is not the continental magnificence of the past's riches.\n\nThis peculiar distribution of the national capacities finds its root in certain racial characteristics. We have first the dominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span> strain quickened, lightened and given force, power<span class='page-number' id='s-51' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.51]</span> and initiative by the Scandinavian and Celtic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>. This mixture has made a national mind remarkably dynamic and practical, with all the Teutonic strength, patience, industry, but liberated from the Teutonic heaviness and crudity, yet retaining enough not to be too light of balance or too sensitive to the shocks of life; therefore, a nation easily first in practical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> and practical dealing with the facts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> of life. Not, be it noted, by any power of clear intellectual thought or by force of imagination or mental intuition, but rather by a strong vital instinct, a sort of tentative dynamic intuition. No spirituality, but a robust ethical turn; no innate power of the thought and the word, but a strong turn for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>; no fine play of emotion or quickness of sympathy, but an abundant energy and force of will. This is one element of the national mind; the other is the submerged, half-insistent Celtic spirit, gifted with precisely the opposite qualities, inherent spirituality, the gift of the word, the rapid and brilliant imagination, the quick and luminous intelligence, the strong emotional force and sympathy, the natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of the things of the mind and still more of those <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the mind, left to it from an ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> tradition and an old forgotten culture, forgotten in its mind, but still flowing in its blood, still vibrant in its subtler nerve-channels. In life a subordinate element, modifying the cruder Anglo-Saxon characteristics, breaking across them or correcting their excess, sometimes refining and toning, sometimes exaggerating the energy of the Norman and the Scandinavian strength and drive, we may perhaps see it emerging at its best, least hampered, least discouraged, in English poetry, coming there repeatedly to the surface and then working with a certain force and vehement but still embarrassed power, like an imprisoned spirit let out for a holiday but within not quite congenial bounds and with an unadaptable companion. From the ferment of these two elements, from the vigorous but chaotic motion created by their fusion and their clash, arise both the greatness and the limitations of English poetry.<span class='page-number' id='s-52' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.52]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-character-of-english-poetry-i","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Character of English Poetry - II","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-character-of-english-poetry-ii","prvt":"The National Evolution of Poetry","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-national-evolution-of-poetry","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-character-of-english-poetry-ii"],"t":"The Character of English Poetry - II","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"What kind or quality of poetry should we naturally expect from a national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> so constituted?

After the old rude epics, saga or Nibelungenlied, we have to wait till quite recent times for poetic utterance, nor, when it came, was it rich or abundant. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span>, so rich in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, in philosophy, in science, the great poetic word has burst out rarely: <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> brief and strong morning time illumined by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, large and steady blaze of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span>'s <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and the wandering fire of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Heine</span>, afterwards a long unlighted stillness. In the North here or there a solitary genius, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ibsen</span>, Strindberg. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Holland</span>, another Teutonic country which developed an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of a considerable but almost wholly objective power, is mute in poetry.[^1] It would almost seem that there is still something too thick and heavy in the strength and depth of the Teutonic composition for the ethereal light and fire of the poetic word to make its way freely through the intellectual and vital envelope. What has saved the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> mind from a like taciturnity? It must have been the mixture of other racial strains, sublimating this strong but heavy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> temperament with a quicker and more impetuous element; the submerged Celtic genius must have pushed the rest from behind, intervening as a decisive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> to liberate and uplift the poetic spirit. And as a necessary aid we have the fortunate accident of the reshaping of a Teutonic tongue<span class='page-number' id='s-53' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.53]</span> by French and Latinistic influences which gave it clearer and more flowing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and turned it into a fine though difficult linguistic material sufficiently malleable, sufficiently plastic for Poetry to produce in it both her larger and her subtler effects, but also sufficiently difficult to compel her to put forth her greatest energies. A stuff of speech which, without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> harsh and inapt, does not tempt by too great a facility, but offers a certain resistance in the material, increases the strength of the artist by the measure of the difficulty conquered and can be thrown into shapes at once of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and of concentrated power. That is eminently the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>.\n\n[^1]: I do not include here any consideration of contemporary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span>; it would be unsafe to go by the great reputations of today which may sink tomorrow to a much lower status.\n\nAt any rate we have this long continuity of poetic production. And once supposing a predominantly Anglo-Saxon or, more strictly an Anglo-Norman national mind moved to express itself in poetry, we should, ignoring for a moment the Celtic emergence, expect the groundwork to be a strong objective poetry, a powerful presentation of the forms of external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, a ready and energetic portrayal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and character in action, the pleasant or the melancholy outsides of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, the robust play of the will and the passions, a vigorous flow of a strenuous vital and physical verse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>. Even we might look for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> deal of deviation into themes and motives for which prose will always be the more adequate and characteristic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>; we should not be surprised to meet here a self-styled Augustan age which makes these things the greater part of its realm and indulges with a self-satisfied contentment in a confident and obvious \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span>\" of external life, preferring to more truly poetic forms and subjects the poetry of political and ecclesiastical controversy, didactic verse, satire. There would be in this Anglo-Norman poetry a considerable power of narrative and a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> of character and incident; but any profounder use of the narrative and dramatic forms we would not look for,—at most we might arrive in the end at some powerful dramatic analysis of character. The romantic element would be of an external Teutonic kind sensational and outward, appealing to the life and the senses; there would be no touch of the delicate and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> imaginative, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> and almost spiritual Celtic<span class='page-number' id='s-54' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.54]</span> romanticism. We should have perhaps much poetical thinking or even poetical philosophy of a rather obvious kind, sedate or vigorous, prompt and direct or robustly powerful, but not the finer and subtler poetic thought which comes easily to the clear Latin <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>. Form too of a kind we might hope for, though we could not be quite sure of it, but at best bright and plain or strongly balanced and not those greater forms in which a high and deep creative thought presides or those more exquisite of which a delicate sense of beauty or a subtle poetic intuition is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> builder. Both the greater and more profound depths and magnitudes and the subtler intensities of style and rhythm would be absent; but there would be a boldly forcible or a well-beaten energy of speech and much of the more metallic vigours of verse. This side of the national mind would prepare us for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> as it was until <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, for the ground-type of the Elizabethan drama, the work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> and Pope, the whole mass of eighteenth-century verse, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cowper</span>, Scott, Wordsworth in his more outward moments, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> without his Titanism and unrest, much of the lesser Victorian verse, Tennyson without his surface aestheticism and elaborate finesse, the poetry of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span>. For this much we need not go outside the Anglo-Norman temperament.\n\nThat also would give, but subject to a potent alchemy of transformation, the basic form and substance of most English poetry. That alchemy we can fairly attribute to the submerged Celtic element which emerges, as time goes on, in bright upstreamings and sometimes in exceptional outbursts of power. It comes up in a blaze of colour, light, emotion and imaginative magic; in a passionate hungering for beauty in its more subtle and delicately sensuous forms, for the ideal which escapes definition and yet has to be seized and cast into interpretative lines; in a lyrical intoxication; in a charm of subtle romance. It casts into the mould a higher urge of thought than the vital common sense of the Saxon can give, not the fine, calm and measured poetical thinking of the Greeks and the Latin races which deals sovereignly with life within the limits of the intellect and the inspired reason, but an excitement of thought seeking for<span class='page-number' id='s-55' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.55]</span> something beyond itself and behind life through the intensities of creative sight. It brings in a look upon Nature which pierces beyond her outsides and her external spirit and lays its touch on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysteries</span> of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and sometimes on that in her which is most intimately spiritual. It awakens rare outbreaks of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span>, a vein of subtler sentiment, a more poignant pathos; it refines passion from a violence of the vital being into an intensity of the soul, modifies vital sensuousness into a thing of imaginative beauty by a warmer aesthetic perception. It carries with it a seeking for exquisite lyrical form, touches narrative poetry to finer issues, throws its romantic beauty and force and fire and its greater depth of passion across the drama and makes it something more than a tumultuous external action and heavily powerful character-drawing. At one period it strives to rise beyond the English mould, seems about to disengage itself and reveal through poetry the Spirit in things. In language and music it is always a quickening and refining force; where it can do nothing more, it breathes a more intimate energy; where it gets its free characteristic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, it creates that intensity of style and rhythm, that sheer force of imaginative vision and that peculiar unseizable beauty of turn which are the highest qualities of English poetry.\n\nThe varied commingling and separating of these two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> mark the whole later course of the literature and present as their effect a side of failure and defect and a side of achievement. There are evidently two opposite powers at work in the same field, often compelled to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> in the same mind at a common production; and when two such opposites can coalesce, seize each other's motives and, fusing them, become one, the very greatest achievement becomes possible. For each fills in the other's deficiencies; they light each other up with a new light and bring in a fresh revelation which neither by itself could have accomplished. The greatest things in English poetry have come where this fusion was effected in the creative mind and soul of the poet. But that could not always be done and there results from the failure a frequent uncertainty of motive, a stumbling unsureness of touch, an oscillation, a habit of too often falling<span class='page-number' id='s-56' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.56]</span> short of the mark. It does not prevent great triumphs of poetic power, but it does prevent a high equality and sustained perfection of self-expression and certainty of form. We must expect inequality in all human work, but not necessarily on this scale nor with so frequent and extensive a sinking below what should be the normal level.\n\nTo the same uncertainty may be attributed the rapid starts and turns of the course of English poetry, its want of conscious continuity,—for there is a secret, underground and inevitable continuity which we have to dig for and disengage. It takes a very different course from the external life of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> which has always been faithful to its inner motive and spirit and escaped from the shattering and suddenly creative changes that have at once afflicted and quickened the life of other peoples. The revolutions of the spirit of English poetry are extreme and violent, astonishing in their decisiveness and abruptness. We can mark off first the early English poetry which found its solitary greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> in Chaucer; indeed it marks itself off by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> exhaustion and cessation, a dull and black <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. The magnificent Elizabethan outburst has another motive, spirit and manner of expression which seem to have nothing to do with the past; it is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> self-born under the impulse of a new age and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>. As this fades away, we see standing high and apart the lonely figure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> with his strenuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> at an intellectual poetry cast in the type of the ancients. The age which succeeds, hardly linked to it by a slender stream of Caroline lyrics, is that of a trivial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> which does not follow the lead of Milton and is the exact contrary of the Elizabethan form and spirit, the thin and arid reign of Pope and Dryden. Another violent and impatient breaking away, a new outburst of wonderful freshness gives us the poetry of Wordsworth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>, Shelley, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Blake</span> with another spirit and another language of the spirit. The Victorian period did not deny their influences; it felt them in the first form of its work, and we might have expected it to have gone nobly forward and brought to some high or beautiful issue what had been only a great beginning that did not arrive at its full fruition. But it did nothing of the kind; it deviated<span class='page-number' id='s-57' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.57]</span> into a new way which has nothing to do with the finer spirit of the preceding poets. Descending it fell away into an intellectual, half-artistic, carefully but not finely or sovereignly wrought and mostly superficial and external poetry. And afterwards we have this age which is still trying to find itself, but in its most characteristic tendencies seems to start from a summary rejection of the Victorian forms and motives. These reversals and revolutions of the spirit are not in themselves a defect or a disability; on the contrary, they open the door to large opportunities and unforeseen achievements. English poetical literature has been a series of bold experiments less shackled by the past than in countries which have a stronger sense of cultural tradition. Revolutions are distracting things, but they are often good for the human soul; for they bring a rapid unrolling of new horizons.\n\nHere comes in the side of success and greatness in this poetry. There is a force which overrides its defects and compensates richly for its limitations; its lapses and failures are the price it pays for its gains. For nowhere else has <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> genius found so free a field; nowhere has it been able to work so directly out of itself and follow so boldly its own line of poetic adventure. Form is a great power, but sureness of form is not everything. A strong tradition of form gives a firm ground upon which genius can work in safety, protected from its own wanderings; but it limits and stands in the way of daring individual adventure. The spirit of adventure, if its path is strewn with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>accidents</span>, stumblings or fatal casualties, brings, when it does succeed, new revelations which are worth all the price paid for them. English poetry is full of such new revelations. Its richness, its constant freshness, its lavish expenditure of genius exulting in chainless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, delivered from all meticulous caution, its fire and penetrating force of imagination, its lambent energy of poetic speech, its constant self-liberation into intensest beauty of self-expression are the rewards of its courage and its liberty. These things are of the greatest value in poetry. They lead besides to possibilities which are of the highest importance to the poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>.\n\nWe may briefly anticipate and indicate in what manner. We have to accept one constant tendency of the spirit of English<span class='page-number' id='s-58' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.58]</span> poetry, which loves to dwell with all its weight upon the presentation of life and action, feeling and passion and to give that its full force and make of it the basis and the source and, not only the point of reference, but the utility of all else. A strong hold upon this life, the earth-life, is the characteristic of the English mind, and it is natural that it should take possession of its poetry. The pure Celtic genius leans towards the opposite extreme: it seems to care little for the earth-life for its own sake and has little hold on it or only a light and ethereal hold; it accepts it as a starting-point for the expression of other-life, but is attracted by all that is hidden and secret. The Latin mind insists on the presentation of life, but for the purposes of thought; its eye is on the universal truths and realities of which life is the visible expression,—not the remoter, the spiritual or soul-truths, but those which present themselves to the clarities of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. But the English mind looks at life and loves it for its own sake, in all its externalities, its play of outer individualities, its immediate subjective idiosyncrasies. Even when it is strongly attracted by other motives, the intellectual, the aesthetic or the spiritual, it seldom follows these with a completely disinterested fidelity, but comes back with them on the external life and tries to subject them to its mould and use them for its purpose. This turn is not universal,—Blake escapes from it; nor is it the single dominant power,—Keats and Shelley and Wordsworth have their hearts elsewhere: but it is a constant power; it attracts even the poets who have not a real genius for it and vitiates their work by the immixture of an alien motive.\n\nThis objective and external turn might be strong enough in some other arts,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span>, for instance, or painting or sculpture,—to create a clear national tradition and principle of form, but not easily in poetry. For here the mere representation of life cannot be enough, however vivid or however strongly subjected to the law of poetic beauty it may be. Poetry must strive at least towards a presentation from within and not at simple artistic reproduction; and the principle of presentation must be something more than that of the eye on the visible object. It is by a process from within, a passing of all one meets, thinks or feels<span class='page-number' id='s-59' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.59]</span> through some kind of intimately subjective vision that life is turned into poetry. If this subjective medium is the inspired reason or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span>, the external presentation of life gives place inevitably to an interpretation, a presentation in which its actual lines are either neglected or subordinated in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that some inner truth of it may emerge. But in English poetry the attempt is to be or at least to appear true to the actual lines of life, to hold up a mirror to Nature. It is the mirror then which has to do the poetising of life; the vital, the imaginative, the emotional temperament of the poet is the reflecting medium and it has to supply unaided the creative and poetical element. We have then a faithfully unfaithful reflection which always amounts to a transformation, because the temperament of the poet lends to life and Nature its own hues, its own lines, its own magnitudes. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of external reality, of an \"imitation\" of Nature is created,—the illusion which has been for so long a first canon of Western artistic conceptions,—and the English mind which carries this tendency to an extreme, feels then that it is building upon the safe foundation of the external and the real; it is satisfied of the earth even when it is singing in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span>.\n\nBut this sole reliance on the temperament of the poet has certain strong results. It gives an immense importance to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, much greater than that which it must always have in poetical creation: the transformation of life and Nature in the individuality becomes almost the whole secret of this poetry. Therefore English poetry is much more powerfully and consciously personal and individual than that of any other language; it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> much less directly at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> and universal. This individual subjective element creates enormous differences between the work of poets of the same age; they cannot escape from the common tendencies, but give to them a quite independent turn and expression and subordinate them to the assertion of the individuality; in other literatures, until recently, the reverse has oftener happened. Besides, the higher value given to the intensity of the imaginative, vital or emotional response favours and is perhaps a first cause of that greater intensity of speech and immediate vision which is the strength of English poetry.<span class='page-number' id='s-60' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.60]</span> For since the heightening cannot come mainly from the power and elevation of the medium through which life is seen, as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian poetry</span>, it has to come almost entirely from the individual response in the poet, his force of personal utterance, his intensity of personal vision.\n\nThree general characteristics emerge. The first is a constant reference and return of the higher poetical motives to the forms of external life, as if the enriching of that life were its principal artistic aim. The second is a great force of subjective individuality and personal temperament as a leading power of poetic creation. The third is a great intensity of speech and ordinarily of a certain kind of direct vision. But in the world's literature generally these are the tendencies that have been on the increase and two of them at least are likely to be persistent. There is everywhere a considerable stressing of the individual subjective element, a drift towards making the most of the poet's personality, an aim at a more vivid response and the lending of new powers of colour and line from within to the vision of life and Nature, a search for new intensities of word and rhythm which will translate into speech a deeper insight. In following out the possible lines of the future the defect of the English mind is its inability to follow the higher motives disinterestedly to their deepest and largest creative results, but this is being remedied by new influences. The entrance of the pure Celtic temperament into English poetry through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Irish revival</span> is likely to do much; the contribution of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian mind</span> in work like Tagore's may act in the same direction.\n\nIf this change is effected, the natural powers of the English spirit will be of the highest value to the future poetry. For that poetry is likely to move to the impersonal and universal, not through the toning down of personality and individuality, but by their heightening to a point where they are liberated into the impersonal and universal expression. Subjectivity is likely to be its greater power, the growth to the universal subjective enriched by all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of the personal soul-experience. The high intensity of speech which English poetry has brought to bear upon all its material, its power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> the fullest and richest<span class='page-number' id='s-61' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.61]</span> value to the word and the image, is needed for the expression of the values of the spiritual, which will be one of the aims of a supreme intuitive utterance. If the pursuit of the higher godheads into their own sphere will be one of its endeavours, their return upon the earth-life to transform our vision of it will be its other side. If certain initial movements we can even now see in English poetry outline and emphasise themselves in the future, this long stream of strong creation and utterance may arrive at a point where it will discover a supreme utility for all its past powers. It may go deeper within itself and find and live in the greater spirit which has till now only occasionally broken into its full native utterance. Arriving at a more comprehensive spiritual motive it may successfully interweave into it the conflicting lines of its past forces. It may achieve clear and powerful forms of a new intuitive utterance in which the Anglo-Celtic spirit will find its highest harmonised and perfect self-expression.

But in its first natural potentiality certain pronounced limitations point to a facile and vigorous success in a forcefully accurate or imaginative presentation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and a more difficult and incomplete success in the intellectual or spiritual interpretation of life; most difficult for it would be a direct presentation of the things <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, a concrete image of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> realities, a poetic approach to the higher truths of the spirit. Yet on the other hand if this difficulty could once be overcome, then because of the profounder intensity of the power of poetical speech which this literature has developed, the very highest and most penetrating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of these profoundest things would be possible. A nearer significant imaging of them would be close to the hand here than could easily be achieved without much new fashioning of language in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Latin tongues</span> whose speech has been cast in the mould of a clear<span class='page-number' id='s-63' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.63]</span> or high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> rather than into the native utterance of imaginative vision adventuring beyond the normal bounds of a high poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. We see in modern French <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> a constant struggle with this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>: even we find a poet like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mallarmé</span> driven to break the mould of French speech in his desperate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to force it to utter what is to its natural clear lucidity almost unutterable. No such difficulty presents itself in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>; the depths, the vistas of suggestion, the power to open the doors of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> are already there, ready to hand for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> rightly gifted to evoke them, waiting and almost asking to be used for the highest purposes. Much less naturally fitted for fine prose utterance, this language has developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the close <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> and shades, the heights and depths, the recesses of fathomless sense needed by the poet.\n\nIt has to be seen how this has come about; for it has not been accomplished at all easily, but only by much seeking and effort. We observe first that English poetry has covered the rising field that lies before the genius of poetry by strictly successive steps, and these steps have followed the natural ascending <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of our developing perceptions as the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> rises from the first physical view of things through the more inward life-vision, through the constructing and pondering <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and last through a vivid or a brooding intuition to the gateways of the spirit. The English creative genius began by a quite external, a clear and superficial substance and utterance. It proceeded to a deeper vital poetry, a poetry of the power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and wonder and spontaneous thought, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and passion and pain, the colour and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> of Life, in which the external presentation of life and things was taken up, but heightened, exceeded and given its full dynamic and imaginative content. From that it turned to an attempt at mastering the secret of the Latins, the secret of a clear, measured and intellectual dealing with life, things and ideas. Then came an attempt, a brilliant and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> attempt to get through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> and thought and the veiled mind in life and Nature and its profounder aesthetic suggestions to some large and deep spiritual truth behind these things. This attempt did not come to perfect fruition; it stopped short partly<span class='page-number' id='s-64' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.64]</span> because there had not been the right intellectual preparation or a sufficient basis of spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and experience; only so much could be given as the solitary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> intuition of the poet could attain by a difficult groping or a sudden sovereign effort. But partly also it failed because after the lapse into an age of reason the spontaneous or the intense language of spiritual poetry could not easily be found or, if found at times, could not be securely kept. So we get a deviation into a second age of intellectualism, an aesthetic or reflective poetry with a much wider range, but much less profound in its roots, much less high in its growth, the creation of a more informed, but less inspired intelligence. And partly out of this increasing wideness of the observing intelligence, partly by a dissatisfaction and recoil from these limitations has come the trend of a recent and contemporary poetry which seems at last to be approaching on some of its lines and in spite of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> mistakes and divagations the secret of the utterance of profounder truth and the right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> of a speech and rhythm which will be the apt <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and motion of its spirit.\n\nThe first definite starting-point of this long <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is the poetry of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span>. Then first the rough poverty of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span> mind succeeded in assimilating the French influence and refined and clarified by it its own rude speech and crude aesthetic sense. It is characteristic of the difficulty of the movement that as in its beginning, so at each important turn, or at least on the three first occasions of a new orientation, it has had thus to go to school, to make almost a fresh start under the influences of a foreign culture and foreign poetic forms and motives. It has needed each time in spite of so much poetic originality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and genius a strong light of suggestion from outside to set it upon its way. All modern literatures have had indeed at one time or another to open out to this kind of external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> and stimulus; but, once formed and in possession of themselves, they adopt these impresses more or less lightly and only as a secondary assistance. But here we have a remodelling of the whole plan under foreign teaching. Chaucer gives English poetry a first shape by the help of French romance models and the work<span class='page-number' id='s-65' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.65]</span> of Italian masters; the Elizabethans start anew in dependence on Renaissance influences from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> and a side wind from Spain; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> goes direct to classical models; the Restoration and the eighteenth century take pliantly the pseudo-classical form from the contemporary French poets and critics. Still this dependence is only in externals; in the essential things of poetry some native character prevails, a new turn is rapidly given, an original power and method emerges; the dynamic vitality of the race was too great not to arrive at an immediate transmutation of the invading force.\n\nThe first early motive and style of this poetry as it emerges in Chaucer strikes at once an English note. The motive is a direct and concrete poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> of ordinary human life and character. There is no preoccupying idea, no ulterior design; life, the external figure and surface of things is reflected as near as possible to its native form in the individual mind and temperament of the poet. Chaucer has his eye fixed on the object, and that object is the visible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of life as it passes before him throwing its figures on his mind and stirring it to a kindly satisfaction in the movement and its interest, a blithe sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span> or a light and easy pathos. He does not seek to add anything to it or to see anything below it or behind its outsides. He is not concerned to look at all into the souls or deeply into the minds of the men and women whose appearance, action and easily apparent traits of character he describes with so apt and observant a fidelity. There is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> on the poet yet to ask himself what is the meaning of all this movement of life or the power in it or draw any large poetic idea from its vivid scheme and structure. He is not moved to interpret life; a clear and happy presentation is his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span>. It is there simply in the sunlight with its familiar lines and normal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span>, sufficiently interesting in itself, by its external action, and he has to record it, to give it a shape in lucid poetic speech and rhythm; for to turn it into stuff of poetry that and the sunlight of his own happy poetic temperament in which he bathes it is all he needs. The form he gives to it is within its limits and for its work admirably apt, sufficient and satisfying,—altogether and excellently satisfying<span class='page-number' id='s-66' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.66]</span> if we ask from it nothing more than it has to offer. Chaucer had captured the secret of ease, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> and lucidity from French romance poetry and had learned from the great Italians more force and compactness of expression than French verse had yet attained, a force diluted and a compactness lightened for his purpose. But neither his poetic speech nor his rhythm has anything of the plastic greatness and high beauty of the Italians. It is an easy, limpid and flowing movement, a well-spring of natural English utterance without depths in it, but limpid and clear and pure. It is a form just fitted for the clear and pleasing poetic presentation of external life as if in an unsoiled mirror. At times it rises into an apt and pointed expression, but for the most part is satisfied with a first primitive power of poetic speech; a subdued and well-tempered even adequacy is its constant gift. Only once or twice does Chaucer, as if by accident, strike out a really memorable line of poetry; yet <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span> and Petrarch were among his masters.\n\nNo other great poetical literature has had quite such a beginning. Others also started with a poetry of external life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> with the poetry of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span>, Latin with the historical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ennius</span>, French with the feudal romances of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Charlemagne</span> cycle and the Arthurian cycle. But in none of these was the artistic aim simply the observant accurate presentation of Greek or Roman or feudal life. Homer gives us the life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> always at a high intensity of impulse and action and without subjecting it to any other change he casts it in lines of beauty and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> proportions; he deals with it as Phidias dealt with the human form when he wished to create a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>god</span> in marble. When we read the Iliad and the Odyssey, we are not really upon this earth, but on the earth lifted into some plane of a greater dynamis of life, and so long as we remain there we have a greater vision in a more lustrous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> and we feel ourselves raised to a semi-divine stature. Ennius' object was to cast into poetical utterance the masculine and imperial spirit of Rome. So the spirit of catholic and feudal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> transmutes life in the French romances and gives in its own way an ideal presentation of it which only misses greatness by the inadequacy of its speech and rhythmic<span class='page-number' id='s-67' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.67]</span> movement and the diffuse prolixity of its form. Chaucer's poetic method has no such great conscious idea or natural uplifting motive or spirit. Whether the colour he gives happens to be realistic or romantic, it falls within the same formula. It is the clear and vivid reflection of external life, with sometimes just a first tinge of romantic illumination, in an observing mind that makes itself a shining poetic mirror.\n\nThe spirit of English poetry thus struck its first strong note, a characteristic English note, got as far as the Anglo-Saxon mind refined by French and Italian influence could go in its own proper way and unchanged nature, and then came suddenly to a pause. Many outward reasons might be given for that abrupt cessation, but none sufficient; for the cause lay deeper in the inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of this spirit. The real cause was that to have developed upon this line would have been to wander up and down in a cul-de-sac; it would have been to anticipate in a way in poetry the self-imprisonment of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutch</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> in a strong externalism, of a fairer kind indeed, but still too physical and outward in its motive. English poetry had greater things to do and it waited for some new light and more powerful impulse to come. Still this external motive and method are native to the English mind and with many modifications have put their strong impress upon the literature. It is the ostensible method of English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> from Richardson to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dickens</span>; it got into the Elizabethan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> and prevented it, except in Shakespeare, from equalling the nobler work of other great periods of dramatic poetry. It throws its limiting shade over English narrative poetry, which after its fresh start in the symbolism of the *Faerie Queene* and the vital intensity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Marlowe</span> ought either to have got clear away from this first motive or at least to have transmuted it by the infusion of much higher artistic motives. To give only one instance in many, it got sadly in the way of Tennyson, who yet had no real turn for the reproduction of life, and prevented him from working out the fine subjective and mystic vein which his first natural intuitions had discovered in such work as the *Lady of Shalott* and the *Morte d'Arthur*. Instead<span class='page-number' id='s-68' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.68]</span> of any deepening of this new original note we have to put up with the *Princess* and *Enoch Arden* and the picturesque triviality of the *Idylls of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span>* which give us the impression of gentlemen and ladies of Victorian drawing-rooms masquerading as Celtic-mediaeval knights and dames. If there is a meaning of some kind in it all, that does not come home to us because it is lost in a falsetto mimicking of the external strains of life. Certainly, it is useless to quarrel with national tendencies and characteristics which must show themselves in poetry as elsewhere; but English poetry had opened the gates of other powers and if it could always have lifted up the forms of external life by these powers, the substance of its work might then have meant much more to the world and the strength of its vision of things might constantly have equalled the power and beauty of its utterance. As it is, even poets of great power have been constantly drawn away by this tendency from the fulfilment of their more characteristic potentialities or misled into throwing them into inapt forms, and to this day there continues this confusion and waste of poetic virtue.\n\nThe new light and impulse that set free the silence of the poetic spirit in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> for its first abundant and sovereign utterance, came from the Renaissance in Italy and Spain and France. The Renaissance meant many things and it meant too different things in different countries, but one thing above all everywhere, the discovery of beauty and joy in every energy of life. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Middle Ages</span> had lived strongly and with a sort of deep and sombre force, but, as it were, always under the shadow of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> and under the burden of an obligation to aspire through suffering to a beyond; their life is bordered on one side by the cross and on the other by the sword. The Renaissance brings in the sense of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> from the burden and the obligation; it looks at life and loves it in excess; it is carried away by the beauty of the body and the senses and the intellect, the beauty of sensation and action and speech and thought,—but of thought hardly at all for its own sake, but thought as a power of life. It is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hellenism</span> returning with its strong sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> and<span class='page-number' id='s-69' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.69]</span> things human, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nihil</span> humani alienum*,[^1] but at first a barbarised Hellenism, unbridled and extravagant, riotous in its vitalistic energy, too much overjoyed for restraint and measure.\n\n[^1]: Nothing human is alien to me.\n\nElizabethan poetry is an expression of this energy, passion and wonder of life, and it is much more powerful, disorderly and unrestrained than the corresponding poetry in other countries; for it has neither a past traditional culture nor an innate taste to restrain its extravagances. It springs up in a chaos of power and of beauty in which forms emerge and shape themselves by a stress within it for which there is no clear guiding knowledge except such as the instinctive genius of the age and the individual can give. It is constantly shot through with brilliant threads of intellectual energy, but is not at all intellectual in its innate spirit and dominant character. It is too vital for that, too much moved and excited; for its mood is passionate, sensuous, loose of rein; its speech sometimes liquid with sweetness, sometimes vehement and inordinate in pitch, enamoured of the variety of its own notes, revelling in image and phrase, a tissue of sweet or violent colours, of many-hued fire, of threads of golden and silver light.\n\nIt bestowed on the nation a new English speech, rich in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, gifted with an extraordinary poetic intensity and wealth and copiousness, but full also of the excesses of new formation and its disorder. A drama exultant in action and character and passion and incident and movement, a lyric and romantic poetry of marvellous sweetness, richness and force are its strong fruits. The two sides of the national mind threw themselves out for the first time, each with its full energy, but within the limits of a vital, sensuous and imaginative mould, fusing into each other and separating and alternating in outbursts of an unrestrained joy of self-expression, an admirable confusion of their autonomous steps, an exhilarating and stimulating licence. The beauty and colour of one was dominant in its pure poetry, the vigour of the other took the lead in its drama, but both in Shakespeare were welded into a supreme phenomenon of poetic and dramatic genius.

But, unhappily, it falls short too in aesthetic effect and virtue in comparison with other poetic periods less essentially vigorous and mobile in their plastic force; it has an inferior burden of meaning and, if a coursing of richer life-blood, no settled fullness of spirit and a less adequate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>. The great magician, Shakespeare, by his marvellous poetic rendering of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and the spell his poetry casts upon us, conceals this general inadequacy of the work of his time: the whole age which he embodies is magnified by his presence and the adjacent paler figures catch something of the light and kinship of his glory and appear in it more splendid than they are. But Shakespeare is an exception, a genius that transcends <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> laws, a miracle of poetic force; he survives untouched all adverse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span>, not because there are not plenty of fairly large spots in this sun, but because in any complete view of him they disappear in the greatness of<span class='page-number' id='s-72' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.72]</span> his lustre. Spenser and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Marlowe</span> are poets of a high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, great in spite of an eventual failure. But the rest owe their stature to an uplifting power in the age and not chiefly to their own intrinsic height of genius; and that power had many vices, flaws and serious limitations which their work exaggerates wilfully rather than avoids, so that it is only exceptionally free from glaring flaws. The gold of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>golden age</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> is often very beautifully and richly wrought, but it is seldom worked into a perfect artistic whole; it disappears continually in masses of alloy, and there is on the whole more of a surface gold-dust than of the deeper yield of the human spirit.\n\nThe defect of this Elizabethan work is most characteristic and prominent in that part of it which has been vaunted as its chief title to greatness, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span>. Shakespeare and Marlowe can be looked at in their separate splendours; but the rest of Elizabethan dramatic work is a brilliantly smoky nebula, powerful in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> rather than sound and noble in performance. All its vigorous presentation of life has not been able to keep it alive; it is dead or keeps only \"the dusty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> of the libraries\", and this in spite of the attention drawn to it in quite recent times by scholars and critics and the hyperbolic eulogies of two or three eminent writers. This is not to say that it has not merits and, in a way, very striking merits. The Elizabethan playwrights were men of a confident robust talent; some of them had real, if an intermittent genius. They had too the use of the language of an age in which the power of literary speech was a common possession and men were handling the language with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> as a quite new and rich <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, lavishly and curiously, turning it this way and that, moulding and new-moulding it, exulting in its novel capacities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. The first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the dramatic form, the temper and some of the primary faculties which go to make dramatic creation possible were there in the literary spirit of the age, and all these writers in more or less degree possessed these things and could use them. A certain force of vital creation was common to them all, a vigorous turn for the half romantic, half realistic reproduction of life and manners. The faculty of producing very freely a mass or a stream<span class='page-number' id='s-73' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.73]</span> of incident and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was there, much power of exuberant dialogue, a knack of expression both in verse and prose, some skill in the trick of putting the language of the passions into the mouth of cleverly constructed human figures which walk actively about the stage, if not in a quite natural manner, yet with enough of it to give for the time the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of living creatures. Especially, it was a time in which there was a fresh and vivid interest in life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, in the adventure and wonder and appeal of the mere vital phenomenon of living and feeling and thinking, and their work is full of this freshness and interest and intense spontaneous delight in living and acting. All this, it might be thought, is quite enough to build a great dramatic poetry; and certainly, if we require no more than this, we shall give a prominent place to the Elizabethan drama, higher perhaps than to the Greek or any other. But these things are enough only to produce plays which will live their time on the stage and in the library; they are not, by themselves, sufficient for great dramatic creation. Something else is needed for that, which we get in Shakespeare, in Racine, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Corneille</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Molière</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Calderón</span>, in the great Greeks, in the leading Sanskrit dramatists; but these other Elizabethans show themselves in the bulk of their work to be rather powerful writers and playwrights than inspired dramatic poets and creators.\n\nDramatic poetry cannot live by the mere presentation of life and action and the passions, however truly they may be portrayed or however vigorously and abundantly pushed across the scene. Its object is something greater and its conditions of success much more onerous. It must have, to begin with, as the fount of its creation or in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> an interpretative vision and in that vision an explicit or implicit seeing idea of life and the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>; and the vital presentation which is its outward instrument, must arise out of that deeper sight harmoniously, whether by a spontaneous creation, as in Shakespeare, or by the compulsion of an intuitive artistic will, as with the Greeks. This interpretative vision and seeing idea have in the presentation to seem to arise out of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> of a few vital types of the human soul or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> representatives of its enigma and to<span class='page-number' id='s-74' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.74]</span> work themselves out through an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of speech leading to an evolution of action. And of these two speech in the drama is the first and more important instrument, because through it the poet reveals the action of the soul; outward action and event are only the second, important, but less essential, reducible even to an indispensable minimum, because the outward movements serve only to make visible and concrete to us the result of the inner action and have no other intrinsic purpose. In all very great drama the true movement and result is psychological; and the outward action, even when it is considerable, and the consummating event, even though loud and violent, are either its symbol or else its condition of culmination. All has to be cast into a close dramatic form, a successful weaving of interdependent relations, relations of soul to soul, of speech to speech, of action to action, the more close and inevitable the better, because so the truth of the whole evolution comes home to us. And if it is asked what in a word is the essential purpose of all this creation, I think we might possibly say that drama is the poet's vision of some part of the world-act in the life of the human soul, it is in a way his vision of Karma, in an extended and very flexible sense of the word; and at its highest point it becomes a poetic rendering or illustration of the Aeschylean *drasanti pathein*, \"the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> shall feel the effect of his act,\" in an inner as well as an outer, a happy no less than an austere significance, whether that effect be represented as psychological or vital, whether it comes to its own through sorrow and calamity, ends in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> by laughter or finds an escape into beauty and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>, whether the presentation be tragic or comic or tragi-comic or idyllic. To satisfy these conditions is extremely difficult and the great dramatists are few in their number; the entire <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> of the world has hardly given us more than a dozen. The difficult evolution of dramatic poetry is always more hard to lead than the lyric which is poetry's native expression, or than the narrative which is its simpler expansion.\n\nThe greatness of a period of dramatic poetry can be measured by the extent to which these complex conditions were understood in it or were intuitively practised. But in the mass of the Elizabethan drama the understanding is quite absent and the<span class='page-number' id='s-75' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.75]</span> practice comes, if at all, only rarely, imperfectly and by a sort of accident. Shakespeare himself seems to have divined these conditions or contained them in the shaping flame of his genius rather than perceived them by the artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. The rest have ordinarily no light of interpretative vision, no dramatic idea. Their tragedy and comedy are both oppressively external; this drama presents, but does not at all interpret; it is an outward presentation of manners and passions and lives by vigour of action and a quite outward-going speech; it means absolutely nothing. The tragedy is irrational, the comedy has neither largeness nor subtlety of idea; they are mixed together too without any artistic connection such as Shakespeare manages to give to them so as to justify thoroughly their coexistence. The characters are not living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> working out their mutual Karma, but external figures of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> jostling each other on a crowded stage, mere tossing drift of the waves of life. The form of the drama too is little more than a succession of speech and incident,[^1] as in a story, with a culminating violent or happy ending, which comes not because psychologically it must, but because a story has to have a release of ending, or, if tragic, its point of loud detonation. To make up for their essential defects these poets have to heap up incident and situation and assail us with vehement and often grossly exaggerated speech and passion, frequently tearing the passion into glaringly coloured tatters, almost always overstraining or in some way making too much of it. They wish to pile on us the interest of life in whose presentation their strength lies, to accumulate in a mass, so as to carry us away, things attracting, things amusing, things striking, things horrible; they will get at us through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> and the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional being</span>,—and in this they succeed eminently,—since they cannot get at us through a higher intellectual and imaginative appeal. The evolution of the action is rather theatrically effective than poetic, the spirit and the psychology melodramatic rather than dramatic.<span class='page-number' id='s-76' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.76]</span> Nor are these radical dramatic defects atoned for by any great wealth of poetry, for their verse has more often some formal merit and a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> of poetry than its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>,—though there are exceptions as in lines and passages of Peele and Webster. The presentation of life with some surface poetic touch but without any transforming vision or strongly suffusing power in the poetic temperament is the general <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of their work. It is necessary to emphasise these defects because indiscriminate praise of these poets helps to falsify or quite exclude the just artistic view of the aim of sound dramatic creation, and imitation of the catching falsities of this model has been the real root of the inefficacy of subsequent attempts in the dramatic form even by poets of great gifts. It explains the failure of even a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> which had the true dramatic turn, a creator like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span>, to achieve drama of the first excellence.\n\n[^1]: Ben <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jonson</span> is an exception. He has the idea of construction, but his execution is heavy and uninspired, the work of a robustly conscientious craftsman rather than a creative artist.\n\nMarlowe alone of the lesser Elizabethan dramatists stands apart from his fellows, not solely by his strong and magnificent vein of poetry, but because he knows what he is about; he alone has some clearly grasped dramatic idea. And not only is he conscious of his artistic aim, but it is a sound aim on the higher levels of the dramatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>. He knows that the human soul in action is his subject and Karma the power of the theme, and he attempts to create a drama of the human will throwing itself on life, the will egoistic and Asuric, conquering only to succumb to the great adversary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Death</span> or breaking itself against the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> its violence has brought into hostile play. This is certainly a high and fit subject for tragic creation and his boldly coloured and strongly cut style and rhythm are well-suited for its expression. Unhappily, Marlowe had the conception, but not any real power of dramatic execution. He is unable to give the last awakening breath of life to his figures; in the external manner so common in English poetry and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> he rather constructs than evolves, portrays than throws out into life, paints up or sculptures from outside than creates from within,—and yet it is this other inward way that is the sole true method of poetic or at least of dramatic creation. He has not, either, the indispensable art of construction; only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of his tragedies does he vitally relate<span class='page-number' id='s-77' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.77]</span> together his characters and their action throughout, and even that, though a strong work, falls far short of the greatness of a masterpiece. He had too, writing for the Elizabethan stage, to adopt a model which was too complex for the strong simplicity of his theme and the narrow intensity of his genius. And he had, working for that semi-barbarous public, to minister to tastes which were quite incongruous with his purpose and which he had not flexibility enough to bring within its scope or to elevate towards its level. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, Marlowe was not a born dramatist; his true genius was lyrical, narrative and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span>. Limited by his inborn characteristics, he succeeds in bringing out his poetic motive only in strong detached scenes and passages or in great culminating moments in which the lyrical cry and the epic touch break out through the form of drama.\n\nShakespeare stands out alone, both in his own age when so many were drawn to the form and circumstances were favourable to this kind of genius, and in all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English literature</span>, as the one great and genuine dramatic poet; but this one is indeed equal to a host. He stands out too as quite unique in his spirit, method and quality. For his contemporaries resemble him only in externals; they have the same outward form and crude materials, but not the inner dramatic method by which he transformed and gave them a quite other meaning and value. Later romantic drama, not only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> but elsewhere, though it has tried hard to imitate the Shakespearian motive and touch, has been governed by another kind of poetic mind; its intrinsic as distinguished from its external method has been really different. Romantic drama, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hugo</span> and in others, takes hold of life, strings together its unusual effects and labours to make it out of the way, brilliant, coloured, conspicuous. Shakespeare does not do that, except rarely, in early imitative work or when he is uninspired. He does not need to lay violent hands on life and turn it into romantic pyrotechnics; for life itself has taken hold of him in order to recreate itself in his image, and he sits within himself at its heart and pours out from its impulse a throng of beings, as real in the world he creates as men are in this other world from which he takes his<span class='page-number' id='s-78' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.78]</span> hints, a multitude, a riot of living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> carried on a many-coloured sea of revealing speech and a never failing surge of movement. His dramatic method seems indeed to have usually no other intellectual purpose, aesthetic motive or spiritual secret: ordinarily it labours simply for the joy of a multiple poetic vision of life and vital creation with no centre except the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> itself, no coordination except that thrown out spontaneously by the unseizable workings of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, no unity but the one unity of man and the life-spirit in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> working in him and before his eyes. It is this sheer creative *ānanda* of the life-spirit which is Shakespeare; abroad everywhere in that age, it incarnates itself in him for the pleasure of poetic self-vision.\n\nAll Shakespeare's powers and limitations—for it is now permissible to speak of his limitations—arise from this character of the force that moved him to poetic utterance. He is not primarily an artist, a poetic thinker or anything else of the kind, but a great vital creator and intensely, though within marked limits, a seer of life. His art itself is life arranging its forms in its own surge and excitement, not in any kind of symmetry,—for symmetry here there is none,—nor in fine harmonies, but still in its own way supremely and with a certain intimately metric arrangement of its many loose movements, in mobile perspectives, a succession of crowded but successful and satisfying vistas. While he has given a wonderful language to poetic thought, he yet does not think for the sake of thought, but for the sake of life. His way indeed is not so much the poet himself thinking about life, as life thinking itself out in him through many mouths, in many moods and moments, with a rich throng of fine thought-effects, but not for any clear sum of intellectual vision or to any high power of either ideal or spiritual result. His development of human character has a sovereign force within its bounds, but it is the soul of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> as seen through outward character, passion, action,—the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span>, and not either the thought-soul or the deeper psychic being, still less the profounder truth of the human spirit. Something of these things we may get, but only in shadow or as a partial reflection in a coloured glass, not in their own action. In his vision and therefore in his poetic<span class='page-number' id='s-79' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.79]</span> motive Shakespeare never really either rises up above life or gets behind it; he neither sees what it reaches out to nor the great unseen powers that are active within it. At one time, in two or three of his tragedies, he seems to have been striving to do this, but all that he does see then is the action of certain tremendous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-forces</span>, which he either sets in a living symbol or indicates behind the human action, as in *Macbeth*, or embodies, as in *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> Lear*, in a tragically uncontrollable possession of his human characters. Nevertheless, his is not a drama of mere externalised action, for it lives from within and more deeply than our external life. This is not Virat, the seer and creator of gross forms, but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hiranyagarbha</span>, the luminous mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>, looking through those forms to see his own images behind them. More than any other poet Shakespeare has accomplished mentally the legendary feat of the impetuous sage Vishwamitra; his power of vision has created a Shakespearian world of his own, and it is, in spite of its realistic elements, a romantic world in a very true sense of the word, a world of the wonder and free power of life and not of its mere external realities, where what is here dulled and hampered finds a greater enlarged and intense breath of living, an ultra-natural play of beauty, curiosity and amplitude.\n\nIt is needful in any view of the evolution of poetry to note the limits within which Shakespeare did his work, so that we may fix the point reached; but still within the work itself his limitations do not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>. And even his positive defects and lapses cannot lower him, because there is an unfailing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> of power in his touch which makes them negligible. He has, however much toned down, his share of the Elizabethan crudities, violences, extravagances; but they are upborne on a stream of power and end by falling in into the general greatness of his scheme. He has deviations into stretches of half prosaic verse and vagaries of tortured and bad poetic expression, sometimes atrociously bad; but they are yet always very evidently not failures of power, but the wilful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> of a great poet, more careful of dramatic truth and carried on by his force of expression than bound to verbal perfection. We feel obliged to accept his defects, which in another poet our critical sense would be swift to condemn or reject,<span class='page-number' id='s-80' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.80]</span> because they are part of his force, just as we accept the vigorous errors of a great personality. His limitations are very largely the condition of his powers. Certainly, he is no universal revealer, as his idolators would have him be,—for even in the life-soul of man there are a multitude of things <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> him; but to have given a form so wonderful, so varied, so immortally alive, in so great a surge of the intensest poetical expression, to a life-vision of this kind and this power, is a unique achievement of poetic genius. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> may find for us a higher and profounder, even a more deeply and finely vital aim for the dramatic form than any Shakespeare ever conceived; but until that has been done with an equal power, grasp and fullness of vision and an equal intensity of revealing speech, he keeps his sovereign station. The claim made for him that he is the greatest of poets may very well be challenged,—he is not quite that,—but that he is first among dramatic poets cannot well be questioned.\n\nSo far then the English poetic spirit had got in the drama, and it has never got any farther. And this is principally because it has allowed itself to be obsessed by the Elizabethan formula; for it has clung not merely to the Shakespearian form,—which might after due modification still be used for certain purposes, especially for a deeper life-thought expressing itself through the strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> of a romantic interpretation,—but to the whole crude inartistic error of that age. Great poets, poets of noble subjective power, delicate artists, fine thinkers and singers, all directly they turn to the dramatic form, begin fatally to externalise; they become violent, they gesticulate, they press to the action and forget to have an informing thought, hold themselves bound to the idea of drama as a robust presentation of life and incident and passion. And because this is not a true idea and, in any case, it is quite inconsistent with the turn of their own genius, they fail inevitably. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> stumbling heavily through his rhymed plays, Wordsworth of all people, the least Elizabethan of poets, penning with a conscientious dullness his *Borderers*, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> diffusing his elemental energy in bad blank verse and worse dramatic construction, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> turning from his unfinished *Hyperion* to wild schoolboy imitations of the worst<span class='page-number' id='s-81' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.81]</span> Elizabethan type, Shelley even, forgetting his discovery of a new and fine literary form for dramatic poetry to give us the Elizabethan violences of the *Cenci*, Tennyson, Swinburne, even after *Atalanta*, following the same ignis fatuus, a very flame of fatuity and futility, are all victims of the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hypnotism</span>.

There is much in it of curious and delighted thinking, but little of a high and firm intellectual value.

The poetry which comes out of this mood is likely to have great charm and imaginative, emotional or descriptive appeal, but may very well miss that depth of profounder substance and that self-possessing plenitude of form which are the other and indispensable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of a rounded <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span></span>.

The *Faerie Queene* is indeed a poem of unfailing imaginative charm and its two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> cantos are exquisite in execution; there is a stream of liquid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span>, of curiously opulent, yet finely tempered description, of fluid poetical phrase and minutely seen image. For these are Spenser's constant gifts, the native form of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> which displays more of descriptive vision than of any larger <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative power</span> or narrative force. An inspired idea is worked out; a little too much lost in detail and in the diffusion of<span class='page-number' id='s-83' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.83]</span> a wealthy prolixity, it still holds well together its rather difficult and entangling burden of symbols and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and achieves in the end some accomplished totality of fine poetic effect. But if we read on after this fine opening and look at the poem as a whole, the effect intended fails, not because it happened to be left unfinished, nor even because the power in it is not equally sustained and is too evidently running thinner and thinner as it proceeds, but because it could not have come to a successful completion. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kalidasa</span>'s *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Birth</span> of the War-God* was left unfinished, or finished by a very inferior hand, yet even in the fragment there is already a masterly totality of effect; there is the sense of a great and admirable design. Virgil's *Aeneid*, though in a way finished, did not receive those last touches which sometimes make all the difference between perfection and the approach to it; and we feel too, not a failure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>,—for that is a defect which could never be alleged against Virgil,—but a relative thinning of the supporting power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. Still the consummate artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> of the poet has been so steadily at work, so complete from the very inception, it has so thought out and harmonised its idea from the beginning that a fine and firm total effect is given. But here there is a defect of the artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, a vice or insufficiency in its original power of harmonising construction, characteristic of the Elizabethan, almost of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> mind.\n\nSpenser's intention seems to have been to combine in his own way the success of Ariosto with the success of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span>. His work was to have been in its form a rich and beautiful romance; but it must be too at the same time a great interpretation by image and symbol, not here of the religious or spiritual, but of the ethical meaning of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. A faery-tale and a vivid ethical symbol in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> is his conception of his artistic task. That is a kind of combination difficult enough to execute, but capable of a great and beautiful effect in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> hand. But the Elizabethan intellectual direction runs always towards conceit and curious complication; it is unable to follow an idea for the sake of what is essential in it, but tangles it up in all sorts of turns and accessories: seizing on all manner of disparates, it tends to throw them together without any real fusion. Spenser in his idea and its<span class='page-number' id='s-84' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.84]</span> execution fell a victim to all these defects of the intelligence. He has taken his intellectual scheme from his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hellenism</span>, the virtues to be figured in typical human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>; but he has dressed it up with the obvious and trivial mediaeval ingenuity of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>allegory</span>. Nor is he satisfied with a simple form of this combination; he has an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span> of all-including representativeness which far exceeds his or perhaps any possible power of fusing creation. The turn of the allegory must be at once ethical, ecclesiastical and political in one fell complexity; his witch of Faery-land embodies <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Falsehood</span>, the Roman Catholic Church and Mary Queen of Scots in an irritating and impossible jumble. The subject of a poem of this kind has to be the struggle of the powers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, but the human figures through whom it works out to its issues, cannot be merely the good or the evil, this or that virtue or vice; they should stand for them as their expressive opportunity of life, not merely as their allegorical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. Spenser, a great poet, is not blind to this elementary condition; but his tangled skein of allegory continually hampers the sounder conception, and the interpretative narration works itself out through the confused maze of its distracting elements which we are obliged to accept, not for their own interest or living force and appeal, but for the beauty of the poetic expression and description to which they give occasion.\n\nBesides this fault of the initial conception, there are defects in the execution. After a time at least the virtues and vices altogether lose their way in faery-land or they become mistily vague and negligible; and this, considering the idea of the poem, ought not to be, but certainly is a great relief to the reader. We are well contented to read the poem or, still better, each canto apart as a romance and leave the ulterior meaning to take care of itself; what was intended as a great ethical interpretative poem of the human soul, lives only as a beautiful series of romantic descriptions and incidents. We can see where the defect is if we make a comparison with the two greater poems of Greece and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> which had an intention not altogether unsimilar, the Ramayana fusing something like a vast faery-tale with the story of an immense struggle between<span class='page-number' id='s-85' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.85]</span> world-powers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good and evil</span>, the Odyssey with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> of romance and its story of the assertion of right and of domestic and personal virtue against unbridled licence and wrong in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> encounter between these opposite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>. The Odyssey is a battle of human will and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> supported by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> power against evil men and wrathful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> and adverse circumstance and the deaf opposition of the elements, and its scenes move with an easy inevitability between the lands of romance and the romance of actual human life; but nowhere does the poet lose in the wealth of incident and description either the harmonising aesthetic colour or the simple central idea. The Ramayana too is made up of first materials which belong to the world of faery romance; but, lifted into an epic greatness, they support easily a grandiose picture of the struggle of incarnate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and Titan, of a human culture expressing the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> and range of ethical values with a giant empire of embattled anarchic force, egoistic violence and domination and lawless self-assertion. The whole is of a piece, and even in its enormous length and protracted detail there is a victorious simplicity, largeness and unity. The English poet loses himself in the outward, in romantic incident and description pursued by his imagination for their own sake. His idea is often too much and too visibly expressed, yet in the end finds no successful expression. Instead of relying upon the force of his deeper poetic idea to sustain him, he depends on intellectual device and parades his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span>. The thread of connection is wandering and confused. He achieves a diffuse and richly confused perplexity, not the unity of a living whole.\n\nThese are the natural limitations of the Elizabethan age, and we have to note them with what may seem at first a disproportionate emphasis, because they are the key to the immediately following reaction of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> with its turn in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> towards a severe and serious intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> and its fall in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> and Pope to a manner which got away from the most prominent defects of the Elizabethan mind at the price of a complete and disastrous loss of all its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>great powers</span>. English poetry before Milton had not passed through any training of the poetic and artistic intelligence; it had abounding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and<span class='page-number' id='s-86' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.86]</span> power, but no self-discipline of the idea. Except in Shakespeare it fails to construct; it at once loses and finds itself in a luxurious indulgence of its force, follows with a loose sweetness or a vehement buoyancy all its impulses good, bad or indifferent. Still what it does achieve, is unique and often superlative in its kind. It achieves an unsurpassed splendour of imaginative vitality and eager vision of the life spirit, and an unsurpassed intensity of poetical expression; life vents itself in speech, pours its lyric emotion, lavishes its intimate and intuitive description of itself in passionate detail, thinks aloud in a native utterance of poetry packed with expressive image or felicitous in directness. There is no other poetry which has in at all the same degree this achievement.\n\nThis poetry is then great in achievement within the limits of its method and substance. That substance and method belong to the second step of the psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> by which poetry becomes a more and more profound and subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the self-expression of the human spirit. English poetry, I have remarked, follows the grades of this ascension with a singular fidelity of sequence. At first it was satisfied with only a primary superficial response to the most external appearances of life, its visible figures and incidents, its primary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and characteristics. To mirror these things clearly, justly, with a certain harmony of selection and a just sufficient transmutation in the personality and aesthetic temperament is enough for this earlier type of poetry, all the more easily satisfied because everything seen by the eye is fresh, interesting, stimulating, and the liveliness of the poetic impression replaces the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of subtlety or depth. Great poetry can be written in early times with this as its substantial method, but not afterwards when the race mind has begun to make an intenser and more inward response to life. It then becomes the resort of a secondary inspiration which is unable to rise to the full heights of poetic possibility. Or else, if this external method still persists as part of the outward manner of a more subjective creation, it is with a demand for more heightened effects and a more penetrating expression. The last was the demand and method of the Elizabethan age.<span class='page-number' id='s-87' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.87]</span>\n\nIn Elizabethan poetry the physical and external tendency still persists, but it is no longer sufficient to satisfy either the perceiving spirit or its creative force. Where it is most preserved, it still demands a more vehement response, strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span>, violent passions, exaggerated figures, out-of-the-way or crowding events. Life is still the Muse of this poetry, but it is a Life which demands to feel itself more and is already knocking or trying to knock at the gates of the deeper subjective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. And in all the best work of the time it has already got there, not very deep, but still enough to be initially subjective. Whatever Shakespeare may suggest,—a poet's critical theories are not always a just clue to his inspiration,—there is not here any true or exact holding up of a mirror to life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, but instead a moved and excited reception and evocation. Life throws its impressions, but what seizes upon them is a greater and deeper <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> in the poet which is not satisfied with mirroring or just beautifully responding to what is cast upon it, but begins to throw up at once around them its own rich <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of receptive being and shaping force and so creates something new, something more personal, intimate, fuller of a first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner vision</span>, emotion, passion of self-expression. This is the source of the new intensity; it is this impulse towards an utterance of the creative life-power within which drives towards the dramatic form and acts with such unexampled power in Shakespeare. At another extremity of the Elizabethan mind, in Spenser, it gets much farther away from the actuality of life; it takes the impressions of the surrounding physical world as hints only for a purely imaginative creation which seems to be truly drawn not from the life of earth, but from a more beautiful and harmonious life-scene that exists either within our own unplumbed depths or on other subtler vital or physical planes. This creation has an aim in it at things symbolic, otherwise revelatory, deeper down in the soul itself, and it tries to shadow them out through the magic of romance, since it cannot yet intimately seize and express them. Still even there the method of the utterance, if not altogether its aim, is the voice of Life lifting itself out into waves of word and colour and image and sheer beauty of sound. Imagination, thought, vision<span class='page-number' id='s-88' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.88]</span> work with the emotional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-mind</span> as their instrument or rather work in it as a medium, accepted as the very form of their being and the very force of their nature.\n\nGreat poetry is the result, but there are other powers of the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> which have not yet been mastered, and to get at these is the next immediate step of English poetry. The way it follows is to bring forward the intellect as its chief instrument; the thought-mind is no longer carried along in the wave of life, but detaches itself from it to observe and reflect upon it. At first there is an intermediate manner, that of Milton's early work and of the Carolean poets, in which something of the Elizabethan impulse, something of its intense imaginative sight or its charm of emotion, prolongs itself for a while, but is fast fading away under the stress of an increasing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span>, a strong dryness of the light of the reason and a growing hardness of form and concentrated narrowness of the observing eye. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> rises on one side into the ripened classical perfection of Milton, and falls away on the other through Waller into the reaction in Dryden and Pope.<span class='page-number' id='s-89' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.89]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-iii","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Course of English Poetry - IV","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-iv","prvt":"The Course of English Poetry - II","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-ii","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-course-of-english-poetry-iv"],"t":"The Course of English Poetry - IV","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"In the work of the intellectual and classical age of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> is again struck by the same phenomenon that we meet throughout, an extraordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> for achievement limited by a characteristic defect which turns in the actual execution to half-success or a splendid failure.

The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of this age went for its sustaining influence and its suggestive models to Greece, Rome and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span>. That was inevitable; for these have been the three typically intellectual nations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>. It is these three literatures that have achieved, each following its own different way and peculiar spirit, the best in form and substance that that kind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> can produce. The English mind, not natively possessed of any inborn intellectual depth and subtlety, not trained to a fine classical lucidity and sure aesthetic taste, had to turn to these sources, if the attempt was to be made at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>. Steeping itself in these sources, it might hope to blend with the classical clarity and form its own masculine force and strenuousness, its strong imagination, its deeper colour and profounder intuitive suggestiveness and so arrive at something new and great to which the world could turn as another supreme element of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic culture</span>. But the effect actually obtained did not answer to the possibility offered. To arrive at this perfection, this new turn of poetry ought to have kept, transmuted but not diminished, all that was best in the Elizabethan spirit and to have coloured, enriched and sweetened with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> touch the classical form and the intellectual motive. There was instead a revolutionary departure, a breaking away, decisive rejection,<span class='page-number' id='s-90' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.90]</span> and entirely new attempt with no roots in the past. In the end not only was the preceding structure of poetry abolished, but all its strong and brilliant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Muses</span> were expelled from their seats. A stucco imitation classical temple, very elegant, very cold and very empty, was erected in the vacant place, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> of satire and didactic commonplace set up in a shrine which was built more like a coffee-house than a sanctuary. A sterile brilliance, a set polished rhetoric was the poor final outcome.\n\nThe age set out with a promise of better things; for a time it seemed almost on the right path. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>'s early poetry is the fruit of a strong classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> still touched with a glow and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> which has been left by a fast receding tide of romantic colour, spontaneous warmth of emotion and passion and vital intuition, gifts of a greater depth and force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> softer influences wove themselves together into his high language and rhythm and were fused in his personality into something wonderfully strong, rich and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span>. Suggestions and secrets were caught from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span>, Peele, Spenser, Shakespeare, and their hints gave a strange <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> to a style whose austerity of power had been nourished by great classical influences. A touch of Virgilian beauty and majesty, a poise of Lucretian grandeur, a note of Aeschylean sublimity, the finest gifts of the ancients coloured or mellowed by richer romantic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> and subtly toned into each other, entered in and helped to prepare the early Miltonic manner. Magnified and exalted by the stress of an original personality, noble and austere, their result was the blending of a peculiar kind of greatness and beauty not elsewhere found in English verse. The substance is often slight, for it is as yet Milton's imagination rather than his soul or his whole mind that is using the poetic form; but the form itself is of a faultless beauty. Already, in spite of this slenderness of substance, we can see the coming change; the retreat of the first exuberant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> and a strong turning of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> upon life to view it sedately from its own intellectual centre of vision are now firmly in evidence. Some of the Elizabethans had tried their hand at this turn, but with no great poetical success; when they wrote their best, even though they tried to think closely and<span class='page-number' id='s-91' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.91]</span> strongly, life took possession of the thought or itself quivered out into thought-expression. Here on the contrary, even in the two poems that are avowedly expressions of vital moods, it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> that are making the mood a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> for reflective brooding; there is no longer here the free and spontaneous life mood chanting its own sight and emotion to its own moved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>. In the minor Carolean poets we have some lingering of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> of the Elizabethan sunset; something of the life-sense and quick emotional value are still there but too thinned and diluted to support any intensity or greatness of speech or manner, and finally they die away into trivialities of the intelligence playing insincerely with the movements of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span></span>. For the reflective idea already predominates over sight and intimate emotion; the mind is looking at the thing felt and is no longer taken up and carried away in the wave of feeling. Some of this work is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> in its subject or motive; but that too, except in some luminous lines or passages, suffers from the same desiccating influence. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of an age of intellect was not the time when a great mystical poetry could leap into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>.\n\nThis ebb is rapid and the change is soon complete. The colour has faded, the sweetness has vanished, song has fallen into a dead hush. For a whole long dry metallic century the lyrical faculty disappeared from the English tongue. The grandiose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> chant of Milton breaks what would be otherwise a complete silence of all higher or profounder poetic power; but it is a Milton who has turned away from the richer beauty and promise of his youth, lost the Virgilian accent, put away from him all Pagan delicacies of colour and grace and sweetness to express only in fit greatness of speech and form the conception of Heaven and Hell and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and the universe which his imagination had built out of his beliefs and reviewed in the vision of his soul. One is moved to speculate on what we might have had from him if, instead of writing after the long silence of his poetic genius during which he remained absorbed in barren political controversy until public and private calamities compelled him to go back to himself and his true power, he had written his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> work in a<span class='page-number' id='s-92' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.92]</span> ripened continuity and deepened strength of his earlier style and vision. Nothing quite so great perhaps, but surely something more opulent, many-toned and perfect. As things happened, it is by *Paradise Lost* that he occupies his high rank among the poets. That too imperfect grandiose epic is the one supreme fruit left by the attempt of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> to seize the classical manner, achieve beauty of poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> disciplined by a high intellectual severity and forge a complete balance and measured perfection of architectonic form and structure.\n\n*Paradise Lost* is one of the few great epic poems in the world's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>; certain qualities in it reach heights which no other of them had climbed, even though as a whole it has defects and elements of failure which are absent in the other great world epics. Rhythm and speech have never attained to a mightier amplitude of epic expression and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>; seldom has there been an equal sublimity of flight. And to a great extent Milton has done in this respect what he had set out to do; he has given English poetic speech a language of intellectual thought which is of itself highly poetic without depending on any of the formal aids of poetic expression except those which are always essential and indispensable, a speech which succeeds by its own intrinsic force and is in its very grain poetry and in its very grain inspired intellectual thought-utterance. This is always the aim of the classical poet in his style and movement, and Milton has fulfilled it. At the same time he has raised this achievement to a highest possible pitch by that peculiar grandeur in the soul and manner of the utterance and that magnificence of sound-tones and amplitude of gait in the rhythm which belong to him alone of poets. These qualities are easily sustained throughout this long work, because with him they are less an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, great artist though he is, than the natural language of his spirit and the natural sound of its motion. His aim is high, his subject loftier than that of any one of his predecessors except <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span>. There is nowhere any more magnificently successful opening than the conception and execution of his Satan and Hell; nowhere has there been a more powerful portraiture of the living spirit of egoistic revolt fallen to its natural element of darkness and pain<span class='page-number' id='s-93' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.93]</span> and yet still sustained by the greatness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> principle from which it was born, even when it has lost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with it and faces it with dissonance and defiance. If the rest of the epic had been equal to its opening books, there would have been no greater poem, few as great in literature.\n\nBut here too the total performance failed and fell below the promise. *Paradise Lost* compels our admiration throughout by its greatness of style and rhythm, but as a whole, in spite of its mighty opening, its whole substance as distinct from its more magnificent or striking parts has failed to enter victoriously either into the mind or into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the world; much of it has not lodged itself deeply in its imagination or enriched sovereignly the acquired stock of its more intimate poetical thought and experience. But the poem that does neither of these things, however noble its powers of language and rhythm, has missed its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. The reason is not to be found in the disparity between Milton's professed aim, which was to justify the ways of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> to man, and the intellectual means available to him for fulfilling his purpose. The theology of the Puritan religion was a poor enough aid for so ambitious a purpose; but the Scriptural legend treated was poetically sufficient if only it had received throughout a deeper interpretation. Dante's theology had the advantage of the richness of import and spiritual experience of mediaeval Catholicism, but intellectually for so deep and vast a purpose it was not any more satisfying or durable. Still through his primitive symbols Dante has seen and has revealed things which make his work throughout poetically and creatively great and sufficient up to a certain high, if narrow level. It is here that Milton failed altogether. Nor is the failure mainly intellectual; it is of a more radical kind. It is true that he had not an original intellect; his mind was scholastic and traditional to a point that discouraged any free thinking power; but he had an original soul and personality and the vision of a poet. It is not the province of poetry to justify intellectually the ways of God to man; what it can do, is to reveal them: but just here is the point of failure. Milton has seen Satan and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Death</span> and Sin and Hell and Chaos; there is a scriptural greatness in his account of these things. But<span class='page-number' id='s-94' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.94]</span> he has not seen God and heaven and man or the soul embodied in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, at once divine and fallen, enslaved to suffering and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, striving for redemption, yearning for a forfeited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> and perfection. On this side there is no inner greatness in the poetic interpretation of his materials. In other words, he has ended by stumbling over the rock of offence that always awaits poetry in which the intellectual element is too predominant, the fatal danger of a failure of vision: he has tried to poetise the stock ideas of his religion and not reached through sight to a living figure of Truth and its great expressive thoughts or revelatory symbols.\n\nThis failure extends itself to all the elements of his later work; it is definitive and he never, except in passages, recovered from it. His language and rhythm remain unfalteringly great to the end, but they are only a splendid robe and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> they clothe is a nobly carved but lifeless image. His architectural structure is always greatly and classically proportioned; but structure has two elements or two methods,—there is the schematic form that is thought out and there is the incarnating organic body which grows from an inward artistic and poetic vision. Milton's structures are thought out; they have not been seen, much less been lived out into their inevitable measures and free lines of inspired perfection. The difference will become evident if we make a simple comparison with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> and Dante or even with the structural power, much less inspired and vital than theirs, but always finely aesthetic and artistic, of Virgil. Poetry may be intellectual, but only in the sense of having a strong intellectual strain in it and of putting forward as its aim the play of imaginative thought in the service of the poetical intelligence; but that must be supported very strongly by the quickening emotion or by the imaginative vision to which the idea opens. Milton's earlier work is suffused by his power of imaginative vision; the opening books of *Paradise Lost* are upborne by the greatness of the soul that finds expression in its harmonies of speech and sound and by the greatness of its sight. But in the later books and still more in the *Samson Agonistes* and the *Paradise Regained* this flame sinks; the thought becomes intellectually externalised, the sight is obvious and on the surface. Milton writing poetry<span class='page-number' id='s-95' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.95]</span> could never fail in greatness and power, nor could he descend, as did Wordsworth and others, in style, turn and rhythm below his well-attained high poetical level; but the supreme vitalising fire has sunk. The method and idea retain sublimity, but the deeper spirit has departed.\n\nMuch greater, initial and essential was the defect in the poetry that followed this strong beginning. Here all is unredeemed intellectuality and even the very first elements of the genuine poetic inspiration are for the most part, one might almost say, entirely absent. Pope and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> and their school, except now and then and as if by accident,—Dryden especially has lines sometimes in which he suddenly rises above his method,—are busy only with one aim, with thinking in verse, thinking with a clear force, energy and point or with a certain rhetorical pomp and effectiveness, in a well-turned and well-polished metrical system. That seems to have been their sole idea of \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span>\", of poetry, and it is an idea of unexampled poverty and falsity. No doubt this was a necessary phase, and perhaps, the English creative mind <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> what it then was, rich and strong but confused and lawless and always addicted in its poetry to quite the reverse of a clear intellectual method, it had to go to an opposite extreme. It had to sacrifice for a time many of its native powers in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to learn as best it could how to arrive at a firm and straightforward expression of thought in a just, well-harmonised, precise and lucid speech; an inborn gift in all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Latin tongues</span>, in a half-Teutonic speech attacked by the Celtic richness of imagination this power had to be acquired even at a cost. But the sacrifice made was immense and entailed much <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of recovery in the later development of the language. The writers of this rationalising age got rid of the Elizabethan language with its opulent confusion, its often involved expression, its lapses into trailing and awkward syntax, its perplexed turn in which ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> jostle and stumble together, fall into each other's arms and strain and burden the expression in a way which is sometimes stimulating and exhilarating, but sometimes merely embarrassing and awkward; they got rid of the crudeness and extravagance but lost all the rich imagination and vision, the<span class='page-number' id='s-96' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.96]</span> sweetness, lyrism, grace and colour, and replaced it with acute point and emphatic glitter. They got rid too of Milton's Latinisms and poetic inversions, substituting smaller rhetorical artifices of their own device,—dismissed his great and packed turns of speech, filling in the void left by the departure of this grandeur with what claimed to be a noble style, but was no more than a spurious rhetorical pomp. Still the work they had to do they did effectively, with talent, energy, even an undeniable genius.\n\nIf the substance of this poetry had been of a higher worth, it would have been less open to depreciation and need not have excited so vehement a reaction or fallen so low from its exaggerated pride of place. But the substance was too often on a par with the method and often below it. It took for its models the Augustan poets of Rome, but it substituted a certain perfection of polish and brilliance and often an element of superficiality and triviality for the strength and weight of the Latin manner. It followed more sincerely the contemporary French models; but it missed their best normal qualities, their culture, taste, tact of expression, and missed too the greater gifts of the classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French poetry</span>. For, though that poetry may often fall short of the intensest poetic delight by its excessive cult of reason and taste, though it may run often in too thin a stream, though it may indulge the rhetorical turn too consistently to achieve utterly the highest heights of speech, yet it has ideas and a strong or delicate power, a true nobility of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Corneille</span>, a fine grace of poetic sentiment and a supreme delicacy and fine passion in Racine. But the verse of these pseudo-Augustan writers does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in these greater gifts: it is occupied with expressing thought, but its thought has most often little or none of the greater values. This Muse is all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of facile reasoning, but has no heart, no depth or sweetness of character, no high nobility of will, no fine appeal or charm of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and sorrow of life. In this flood of brilliant and forcefully phrased commonplace, even ideas which have depths behind them tend to become shallow and external by the way of their expression. The mind of these writers has no great seeing eye on life. Its satire is the part of their work which is still most alive; for here the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span> spirit gets back to itself,<span class='page-number' id='s-97' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.97]</span> leaves the attempt at a Gallicised refinement, finds its own robust vigour and arrives at a brutal, but still a genuine and sometimes really poetic vigour and truth of expression. Energy and driving force, the English virtues, are, indeed, a general merit of the verse of Pope and Dryden and in this respect they excel their French exemplars. Their expression is striking in its precision; each couplet rings out with a remarkable force of finality and much coin of their minting has passed into common speech and citation. If there is not much gold of poetry here, there is at least much wellgilt copper coin of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> currency, useful for small purchases and petty traffic. But in the end one is tired of a monotonous brilliance of language, wearied out by the always repeated trick of decisiveness and point of rhythm. This verse has to be read by couplets and passages; for each poem is only a long string of them and, except in one or two instances, the true classical gift, the power of structure is absent. There is an almost complete void of the larger genuine thought-power which is necessary for structure. This intellectual age of English poetry did its work, but, as was inevitable with so pronounced a departure from the true or at least the higher line, that work gives the impression, if not of a resonant failure, at least of a fall or a considerable descent to lower levels. This Augustan age not only falls infinitely far below the Roman from which it drew so much of its inspiration, but gives an impression of great inferiority when compared with the work of the Victorians and one is tempted to say that a little of the work of Wordsworth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> and Shelley has immeasurably more poetic value than all this silver and tin and copper and the less precious metals of these workers whose superficiality of workmanship was a pride of this age.\n\nBut although this much has to be said, it would be by itself too one-sided and depreciative a view of the work of what is after all a period of the most brilliant and energetic writing and a verse which in its own way and its own technique is most carefully wrought and might even claim a title to a supreme craftsmanship: nor can we ignore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that in certain types such as satire, the mock heroic, the set didactic poem these writers achieved the highest height of a consummate and often<span class='page-number' id='s-98' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.98]</span> impeccable excellence. Moreover some work was done especially by Dryden which even on the higher levels of poetry can challenge comparison with the work of the Elizabethans and the greater poets of later times. Even the satire of Pope and Dryden rises sometimes into a high poetic value <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the level they normally reached and they have some great outbursts which have the power not only to please or delight by their force and incisiveness or their weight of thought or their powerful presentation of life, but to move to emotion, as great poetry moves us. It is not necessary here to say more in vindication of the excelling work of these writers; their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> abides and no belittling can successfully depreciate their work or discount its excellence. We are concerned here only with their place in the development, and mainly, the psychological development of English poetry. Its place there, its value is mostly in the direction of a sheer intellectuality concerned with the more superficial aspects of thought and life deliberately barren of emotion except the more superficial; lyricism has run dry, beauty has become artificial where at all it survives, passion is replaced by rhetoric, the heart is silent, life has civilised, urbanised, socialised and stylised itself too much to have any more a very living contact with Nature. As the literature of an age of this kind this poetry or this powerful verse has an enormous merit of its own and could hardly be better for its purpose. Much more perhaps than any other age of intellectual writing it has restricted itself to its task; in doing so it has restricted its claims to poetic greatness of the highest kind, but it has admirably done its work. That work is not faultless; it has too much of the baser lead of rhetoric, too frequent a pomposity and artifice, too little of Roman nobility and too little of English sincerity to be of the first value. But it stands out well enough on its own lower summit and surveys well enough from that inferior eminence a reach of country that has, if not any beauty, its own interest, order and value. There we may leave it and turn to the next striking and always revolutionary outburst of this great stream of English poetic literature.<span class='page-number' id='s-99' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.99]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-iv","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Course of English Poetry - V","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-v","prvt":"The Course of English Poetry - III","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-iii","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-course-of-english-poetry-v"],"t":"The Course of English Poetry - V","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When a power of poetry in a highly evolved language describes so low a downward curve as to reach this dry and brazen intellectualism, it is in danger of losing much of its vitality and flexibilities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> and it may even, if it has lived too long, enter into a stage of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span> and perish by a dull slow decay of its creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>.

Poetry, even when it is dominated by intellectual tendency and motive, cannot really live and work by intellect alone. Its impetus is not created and its functioning and results are not shaped either wholly or predominantly by reason and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span>; an intuitive seeing and an inspired <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> are its natural means or its native sources. But intuition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> are not only spiritual in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>, they are the characteristic means of all spiritual vision and utterance; they are rays from a greater and intenser Light than the tempered clarity of our intellectual understanding.

Their common use in poetry is to give a deeper and more luminous force and a heightened beauty to the perceptions of outward life or to sublimate the more inward but still untransformed and comparatively surface movements of human emotion and passion or to empower thought to perceive and utter certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> and universal truths which enlighten or which raise to a greater meaning the sensible appearances of the inner and outer life of Nature and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>.

When the eye of the poet has seen the life of man and the world externally or penetrated into its more vital inwardness or has risen to the clarities and widenesses of a thought which observantly perceives or intimately understands it, and when his word has caught some revealing speech and rhythm of what he has seen, much has been done, but not all that is possible to poetic vision and utterance. This other and greater realm still remains open for a last transcendence.\n\nFor the first time in occidental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>, we get in this fourth turn of the evolution of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> some faint initial falling of this higher light upon the poetic intelligence. Some ancient poets may have received something of it through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>myth</span> and symbol; a religious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> here and there may have attempted to give his experience rhythmic and imaginative form. But here is the first poetic attempt of the intellectual faculty striving at a high height of its own development to look beyond its own level directly into the unseen and the unknown and to unveil some ideal truth of its own highest universal conceptions hidden behind the veil of the ordinary mind and supporting them in their return to their eternal source. This high departure was not an inevitable outcome of the age that preceded Wordsworth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Blake</span> and Shelley. The intellectual endeavour had been in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> inadequate in range, subtlety and depth, in those who followed paltry, narrow and elegantly null, in both supported by an insufficient knowledge. A new and larger endeavour in the same field might rather have been expected which would have set before it the aim of a richer, deeper, wider, more curious intellectual humanism, poetic, artistic, many-sided, sounding by the poetic reason the ascertainable truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and man and Nature. That was<span class='page-number' id='s-102' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.102]</span> the line followed by the main stream of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> and culture, and to that too English poetry had eventually to turn in the intellectual fullness of the nineteenth century. It was already the indistinct and half-conscious drift of the slow transitional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which intervenes between Pope and Wordsworth; but as yet this movement was obscure, faltering and poor in its achievement. When a greater force came streaming in, the influences that were abroad were those which elsewhere found expression in the revolutionary idealism of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French Revolution</span> and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>German transcendentalism</span> and romanticism. Intellectual in their idea and substance, they were in the mind of five or six English poets, each of them a remarkable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, carried beyond themselves by the sudden emergence of some half-mystical Celtic turn of the national mind into supra-intellectual sources of inspiration. Insufficiently supported by any adequate spiritual knowledge, unable to find except rarely the right and native word of their own meaning, these greater tendencies faded away or were lost by the premature end of the poets who might, had they lived, have given them a supreme utterance. But still theirs was the dawn of whose light we shall find the noon in the age now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> before us if it fulfils all its intimations. Blake, Shelley, Wordsworth were first explorers of a new world of poetry other than that of the ancients or of the intermediate poets, which may be the familiar realm of the aesthetic faculty in the future, must be in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> if we are not continually to describe the circle of efflorescence, culmination and decay within the old hardly changing circle.\n\nCertain motives which led up to this new poetry are already visible in the work of the middle eighteenth century. There is, first, a visible attempt to break quite away from the prison of the formal metrical mould, rhetorical style, limited subject-matter, absence of imagination and vision imposed by the high pontiffs of the pseudo-classical cult. Poets like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gray</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Collins</span>, Thomson, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chatterton</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cowper</span> seek <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> by a return to Miltonic blank verse and manner, to the Spenserian form,—an influence which prolonged itself in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> and Shelley,—to lyrical movements, but more prominently the classical ode form, or<span class='page-number' id='s-103' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.103]</span> to freer and richer moulds of verse. Some pale effort is made to recover something of the Shakespearian wealth of language or of the softer, more pregnant colour of the pre-Restoration diction and to modify it to suit the intellectualised treatment of thought and life which was now an indispensable element; for the old rich vital utterance was no longer possible, an intellectualised speech had become a fixed and a well-acquired need of a more developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. Romanticism of the modern type now makes its first appearance in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of the subjects of poetic interest and here and there in the treatment, though not yet quite in the grain and the spirit. Especially, there is the beginning of a direct gaze of the poetic intelligence and imagination upon life and Nature and of another and a new power in English speech, the poetry of sentiment as distinguished from the inspired voice of sheer feeling or passion. But all these newer motives are only incipient and unable to get free expression because there is still a heavy weight of the past intellectual tradition. Rhetoric yet loads the style or, when it is avoided, still the purer intensity of poetic emotion is not altogether found. Verse form tends to be still rather hard and external or else ineffective in its movement; the native lyric note has not yet returned, but only the rhetorical stateliness of the ode, not lyricised as in Keats and Shelley, or else lyrical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> managed with only an outward technique but without any cry in them. Romanticism is still rather of the intellect than in the temperament, sentiment runs thinly and feebly and is weighted with heavy intellectual turns. Nature and life and things are seen accurately as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> and forms, but not with any vision, emotion or penetration into the spirit behind them. Many of the currents which go to make up the great stream of modern poetry are beginning to run in thin tricklings, but still in a hard and narrow bed. There is no sign of the swift uplifting that was to come as if upon the sudden wings of a splendid moment.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burns</span> these new-born imprisoned spirits break out from their bounds and get into a free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> of natural, direct and living reality, find a straightforward speech and a varied running or bounding movement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>. This is the importance of this<span class='page-number' id='s-104' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.104]</span> solitary voice from the north in the evolution, apart from the intrinsic merits of his poetry. His work has its limitations; the language is often too intellectualised to give the lyrical emotion, though it comes from the frank, unartificial and sturdy intellect of a son of the soil; the view on life is close, almost too close to give the deeper poetic or artistic effect, but it deals much with outsides and surfaces and the commonnesses and realisms of action, sometimes only does it suggest to us the subtler something which gives lyrical poetry not only its form and lilt and its power to stir,—all these he has,—but its more moving inmost appeal. Nevertheless, Burns has in him the things which are most native to the poetry of our modern times; he brings in the new naturalness, the nearness of the fuller poetic mind, intellectualised, informed with the power of clear reflective thought awake to life and nature, the closely observing eye, the stirring force of great general ideas, the spirit of revolt and self-assertion, the power of personality and the free play of individuality, the poignant sentiment, sometimes even a touch of psychological subtlety. These things are in him fresh, strong, initial as in a forerunner impelled by the first breath of the coming air, but not in that finished possession of the new motives which is to be the greatness of the future master-singers. That we begin to get first in Wordsworth. His was the privilege of the earliest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span>.\n\nThis new poetry has six great voices who fall naturally in spite of their pronounced differences into pairs, Wordsworth and Byron, Blake and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Coleridge</span>, Shelley and Keats. Byron sets out with a strangely transformed echo of the past intellectualism, is carried beyond it by the elemental force of his personality, has even one foot across the borders of the spiritual, but never quite enters into that kingdom. Wordsworth breaks away with deliberate purpose from the past, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> his way into this new realm, but finally sinks under the weight of the narrower intellectual tendencies which he carries with him into its amplitudes. Blake and Coleridge open magical gates, pass by flowering sidelanes with hedges laden with supernatural blooms into a middle world whence their voices come to us ringing with an unearthly melody. In Shelley the idealism and spiritual impulse rise to almost giddy<span class='page-number' id='s-105' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.105]</span> heights in a luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> and are lost there, unintelligible to contemporary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, only now beginning to return to us with their message. Keats, the youngest and in many directions the most gifted of these initiators, enters the secret temple of ideal Beauty, but has not time to find his way into the deepest mystic sanctuary. In him the spiritual seeking stops abruptly short and prepares to fall away down a rich sensuous incline to a subsequent poetry which turns from it to seek poetic Truth or pleasure through the senses and an artistic or curiously observing or finely psychologising intellectualism.

Here are the free, impetuous but often narrow sources of these wider flowings.

At the very beginning and still more and increasingly afterwards this modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> as in thought and science, takes the form of an ever widening and deepening intellectual and imaginative curiosity, an insatiable passion for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, an eager lust of finding, a seeking eye of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> awakened to all the multiform possibilities of an endless new truth and discovery. The Renascence was an awakening of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> spirit to wonder and curiosity and reflection and the stirred discovery of all that is brilliant and curious in the things of the life and the mind on their surface; but the fullness of the modern age has been a much larger comprehensive awakening of the informed and clarified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> to a wider curiosity, a much more extensive adventure of discovery and an insistent need to penetrate deeper and know and possess the truth of Nature and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and the universe,—both their outer truth and process<span class='page-number' id='s-107' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.107]</span> and whatever deeper mystery may lie hidden behind their first appearances and suggestions. And now it is culminating in something that promises to go beyond it, to bring about a new futurist rather than modernist age in which the leader of the march shall be intuition rather than the reasoning and critical intelligence. The long intellectual search for truth that went probing always deeper into the physical, the vital and the subjective, into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and life, into the yet ill-grasped motions of mind and emotion and sensation and thought, is now beginning to reach beyond these things or rather through their subtlest and strongest intensities of sight and feeling towards the truths of the Spirit. The soul of the Renascence was a lover of life and an amateur of knowledge; but the modern spirit has been drawn rather by the cult of a clear, broad and minute intellectual and practical Truth: the dominating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> is a straining after knowledge and a power of life founded on the power of knowledge. Poetry in the modern age has followed intellectually and imaginatively the curve of this great impulse.\n\nContinental literature displays the mass of this movement with a much more central completeness and in a stronger and more consistent body and outline than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry.

In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> the threads are more confused, the work has on the whole a less clear and definite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and there is in spite of the greatness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> poets an inferior total effectivity; but at the beginning and the end it has <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> higher note, a lifting<span class='page-number' id='s-108' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.108]</span> of sight beyond the stress of the intellect and the senses, which is reached either not at all or much less directly realised with a less pure vision in the more artistically sound and sufficient poetry of the Continent. Still the principal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> are distinguishable, sometimes very strongly pronounced and helped to some fullest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> by the great individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of imagination and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> which are the most distinct powers of the English poetic mind. Often they thus stand out all the more remarkable by the magnificent narrowness of their self-concentrated isolation.\n\nEarliest among these many new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> to emerge with distinctness is an awakening of the eye to a changed vision of Nature, of the imagination to a more perfect and intimate visualisation, of the soul to a closer spiritual communion. An imaginative, scrutinising, artistic or sympathetic dwelling on the details of Nature, her sights, sounds, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, sensible impressions is a persistent characteristic of modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and poetry; it is the poetic side of the same tendency which upon the intellectual has led to the immeasurable development of the observing and analysing eye of Science. The poetry of older times directed an occasional objective eye on Nature, turning a side glance from life or thought to get some colouring or decorative effect or a natural border or background for life or something that illustrated, ministered to or enriched the human thought or mood of the moment, at most for a casual indulgence of the imagination and senses in natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. But the intimate subjective treatment of Nature, the penetrated human response to her is mostly absent or comes only in rare and brief touches. On the larger scale her subjective life is realised not with an immediate communion, but through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>myth</span> and the image of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> personalities that govern her powers. In all these directions modern poetry represents a great change of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> and a swift and vast extension of our imaginative experience. Nature now lives for the poet as an independent presence, a greater or equal power dwelling side by side with him or embracing and dominating his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. Even the objective vision and interpretation of her has developed, where it continues at all the older poetic method, a much more<span class='page-number' id='s-109' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.109]</span> minute and delicate eye and touch in place of the large, strong and simply <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> or telling effects which satisfied an earlier imagination. But where it goes beyond that fine outwardness, it has brought us a whole world of new vision; working sometimes by a vividly suggestive presentation, sometimes by a separation of effects and an imaginative reconstruction which reveals aspects the first outward view had hidden in, sometimes by a penetrating impressionism which in its finest subtleties seems to be coming back by a detour to a sensuously mystical treatment, it goes within through the outward and now not so much presents as recreates physical Nature for us through the imaginative vision.[^1] By that new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> it penetrates through the form nearer to the inner truth of her being.\n\n[^1]: I am speaking here of Western literature. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Oriental</span> art and poetry at any rate in the far <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> had already in a different way anticipated this more intimate and imaginative seeing.\n\nBut the direct subjective approach to Nature is the most distinctly striking characteristic turn of the modern mentality. The approach proceeds from two sides which constantly meet each other and create between them a nexus of experience between man and Nature which is the modern way of responding to the universal Spirit. On one side there is the subjective sense of Nature herself as a great life, a being, a Presence, with impressions, moods, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> of her own expressed in her many symbols of life and stressing her objective manifestations. In the poets in whom this turn first disengages itself, that is a living conscious view of her to which they are constantly striving to give expression whether in a large sense of her presence or in a rendering of its particular impressions. On the other side there is a sensitive human response, moved in emotion or thrilling in sensation or stirred by sheer beauty or responsive in mood, a response of satisfaction and possession or of dissatisfied yearning and seeking, in the whole an attempt to relate or harmonise the soul and mind and sensational and vital being of the human individual with the soul and mind and life and body of the visible and sensible universe. Ordinarily it is through the imagination<span class='page-number' id='s-110' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.110]</span> and the intellect and the soul of sensibility that this approach is made; but there is also a certain endeavour to get through these instruments to a closer spiritual relation and, if not yet to embrace Nature by the Spirit in man, to harmonise and unite the spiritual soul of man with the spiritual Presence in Nature.\n\nAnother widening of experience which modern poetry renders much more universally and with a constant power and insistence is a greater awakening of man to himself, to man in this warp and weft of Space and Time and in the stress of the universe, to all that is meant by his present, his past and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. Here too we have a parallel imaginative movement in poetry to the intellectual movement of thought and science with its large and its minute enquiry into the origins and antiquity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the race, into the sources of its present development, into all its physical, psychological, sociological being and the many ideal speculations and practical aspirations of its future which have arisen from this new knowledge of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> and his possibilities. Formerly, the human mind in its generality did not go very far in these directions. Its philosophy was speculative and metaphysical, but with little actuality except for the intellectual and spiritual life of the individual, its science explorative of superficial phenomenon rather than opulent both in detail and fruitful generalisation; its view of the past was mythological, traditional and national, not universal and embracing; its view of the present was limited in objective scope and, with certain exceptions, of no very great subjective profundity; an outlook on the future was remarkable by its absence. The constant self-expansion of the modern mind has broken down many limiting barriers; a vast objective knowledge, an increasingly subtle subjectivity, a vivid living in the past, present and future, a universal view of man as of Nature are its strong innovations. This change has found inevitably its vivid reflections in the wider many-sided interests, the delicate refinements, fine searchings, large and varied outlook and profound inlook of modern poetry.\n\nThe first widening breadth of this universal interest in man, not solely the man of today and our own country and type or of the past tradition of our own culture, but man in himself in<span class='page-number' id='s-111' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.111]</span> all his ever-changing history and variety, came in the form of an eager poetic and romantic valuing of all that had been ignored and put aside as uncouth and barbarous by the older classical or otherwise limited type of mentality. It sought out rather all that was unfamiliar and attractive by its unlikeness to the present; its imagination was drawn towards the primitive, the savage, to mediaeval man and his vivid life and brilliant setting, to the Orient very artificially seen through a heavily coloured glamour, to the ruins of the past, to the life of the peasant or the solitary, the outlaw, to man near to Nature undisguised by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conventions</span> and uncorrupted by an artificial culture or man in revolt against conventions: there is a willed preference for these strange and interesting aspects of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, as in Nature for her wild and grand, savage and lonely scenes or her rich and tropical haunts or her retired spots of self-communion. On one side a sentimental or a philosophic naturalism, on the other a flamboyant or many-hued romanticism, superficial mediaevalism, romanticised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hellenism</span>, an interest in the fantastic and the supernatural, tendencies of an intellectual or an ideal transcendentalism, are the salient constituting characters. They make up that brilliant and confusedly complex, but often crude and unfinished literature, stretching from Rousseau and Chateaubriand to Hugo and taking on its way <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span>, Schiller and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Heine</span>, Wordsworth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> and Shelley, which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> a hasty transition from the Renascence and its after-fruits to the modernism of today which is already <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> the modernism of yesterday. Much of it we can now see to have been ill-grasped, superficial and tentative; much, as in Chateaubriand and in Byron, was artificial, a pose and affectation; much, as in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French Romanticists</span>, merely bizarre, overstrained and overcoloured; a later <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span> condemned in it a tendency to inartistic excitement, looseness of form, an unintellectual shallowness or emptiness, an ill-balanced imagination. It laid itself open certainly in some of its more exaggerated turns to the reproach,—not justly to be alleged against the true romantic element in poetry,—that the stumbling-block of romanticism is falsity. Nevertheless behind this often defective frontage was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of a considerable<span class='page-number' id='s-112' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.112]</span> force of new truth and power, much exceedingly great work was done, the view of the imagination was immensely widened and an extraordinary number of new motives brought in which the later nineteenth century developed with a greater care and finish and conscientious accuracy, but with crudities of its own and perhaps with a less fine gust of self-confident <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and large inspiration.\n\nThe recoil from these primary tendencies took at first the aspect of a stress upon artistic execution, on form, on balance and design, on meticulous beauty of language and a minute care and finished invention in rhythm. An unimpassioned or only artistically impassioned portraiture and sculpture of scene and object and idea and feeling, man and Nature was the idea that governed this artistic and intellectual effort. A wide, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and impartial interest in all subjects for the sake of art and a poetically intellectual satisfaction,—this poise had already been anticipated by Goethe,—is the atmosphere which it attempts to create around it. There is here a certain imaginative reflection of the contemporary scientific, historic and critical interest in man, in his past and present, his creations and surroundings, a cognate effort to be unimpassioned, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>, scrupulous, sceptically interested and reflective. In poetry, however, it loses the cold accuracy of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>critical intellect</span> and assumes the artistic colour, emphasis, warmth of the constructive imagination: but even here there is the same tendency to a critical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> of man and things and world tendencies and a reflective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> sometimes overweighting the natural tendency of poetry to the living and creative presentation which is its native power. There is amidst a wide atmosphere of sceptical or positive thinking an attempt to enter into the psychology of barbaric and civilised, antique, mediaeval, and modern, occidental and oriental humanity, to reproduce in artistic form the spirit of the inner truth and outer form of its religions, philosophic notions, societies, arts, monuments, constructions, to reflect its past inner and outer history and present frames and mentalities. This movement too was brief in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duration</span> and soon passed away into other forms which arose out of it, though they seemed a revolt against its<span class='page-number' id='s-113' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.113]</span> principles. This apparent paradox of a development draped in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> of revolt is a constant psychological feature of all human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>.\n\nIn this turn we are struck by its most glaring feature, the vehement waving of the revolutionary red flag of realism. Realism is in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> an attempt to see man and his world as they really are without veils and pretences; it is imagination turning upon itself and trying to get rid of its native tendency to give a personal turn or an enhanced colouring to the object, art trying to figure as a selective process of scientific observation and synthetised analysis. Necessarily, whenever it is art at all, it betrays itself in the process. Its natural movement is away from the vistas of the past to a preoccupation with the immediate present, although it began with a double effort, to represent the past with a certain vividness of hard and often brutal truth, not in the colours in which the ideally constructive imagination sees it through the haze of distance, and to represent the present too with the same harsh and violent actuality. But success in this kind of representation of the past is impossible; it carries in it always a sense of artificiality and willed construction. Realism tends naturally to take the present as its field; for that alone can be brought under an accurate because an immediate observation. Scientific in its inspiration, it subjects man's life and psychology to the scalpel and the microscope, exaggerates all that strikes the first outward view of him, his littlenesses, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imperfections</span>, uglinesses, morbidities, and comes easily to regard these things as the whole or the greater part of him and to treat life as if it were a psychological and physiological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span>, a fungoid growth upon <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> Nature</span>: it ends, indeed almost begins, by an exaggeration and overstressing which betrays its true character, the posthumous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> of romanticism perverted by a pseudo-scientific preoccupation. Romanticism also laid a constant stress on the grotesque, diseased, abnormal, but for the sake of artistic effect, to add another tone to its other glaring colours. Realism professes to render the same facts in the proportions of truth and science, but being art and not science, it inevitably seeks for pronounced effects by an evocative stress which falsifies the<span class='page-number' id='s-114' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.114]</span> dispositions and shades of natural truth in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to arrive at a conspicuous vividness. In the same movement it falsifies the true measure of the ideal, which is a part of the totality of human life and nature, by bringing the idealism in man down to the level of his normal daily littlenesses; in attempting to show it as one strand in his average humanity, it reduces it to a pretension and figment; it ignores the justification of the idealistic element in art which is that the truth of the ideal consists essentially in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> beyond the limitations of immediate actuality, in what our strain towards self-exceeding figures and not in the moment's failure to accomplish. Realism on both those sides, in what it ignores and what it attempts, lies open to the reproach aimed at romanticism; its stumbling-block is a falsity which pursues both its idea and its method. Nevertheless this movement too behind its crudities has brought in new elements and motives. It has done very considerable work in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> and prose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span>; in poetry, even, it has brought in some new strains and greater powers, but here it cannot dominate without risking to bring about the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of the very spirit of poetry whose breath of life is the exceeding of outward reality. Realism is still with us, but has already evolved out of itself another <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative power</span> whose advent announces its own passing.<span class='page-number' id='s-115' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.115]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-movement-of-modern-literature-i","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Movement of Modern Literature - II","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-movement-of-modern-literature-ii","prvt":"The Course of English Poetry - V","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-course-of-english-poetry-v","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-movement-of-modern-literature-ii"],"t":"The Movement of Modern Literature - II","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Out of the period of dominant objective realism what emerges with the strongest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> to quite an opposite principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> of pronounced and conscious subjectivity.

The temper of the age has been an earnest critical and scientific curiosity, a desire to see, know and understand the world as it is: that requires a strong and clear eye turned on the object and it would seem to require also as far as possible an elimination of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>'s own personality; a strongly personal view of things would appear to be the very contrary of an accurate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span>, for the first constructs and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> the object from within, the second would allow it to impress its own colour and shape on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>,—we have to suppose, of course, that, as the modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> has generally held, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> exist in themselves and not in our own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of them. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span> definitely framed this theory of literary creation when he laid it down that the ideal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and poetry was to be beautifully objective. With the exception of some of the first initiators and until yesterday, modern creation has followed more or less this line: it has tried to give either a striking, moving and exciting or an aesthetically sound or a realistically powerful presentation,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> three methods often intermingling or coalescing,—rather than a subjective interpretation; thought, feeling, aesthetic treatment of the object are supposed to intervene upon and arise from a clear or strong objective observation.<span class='page-number' id='s-116' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.116]</span>\n\nBut on the other hand an equally strong characteristic of the modern mind is its growing subjectivity, an intense consciousness of the I, the soul or the self, not in any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> withdrawal within or inward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span>, or not in that pre-eminently, but in relation to the whole of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>. This characteristic distinguishes modern subjectivism from the natural subjectivity of former times, which either tended towards an intense solitary inwardness or was superficial and confined to a few common though often strongly emphasised notes. Ancient or mediaeval <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> might return more self-assertive or violent responses to life, but the modern kind is more subtly and pervasively self-conscious and the stronger in thought and feeling to throw its own image on things, because it is more precluded from throwing itself out freely in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and living. This turn was in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> an inevitable result of an increasing force of intellectualism; for great intensity of thought, when it does not isolate itself from emotion, reactive sensation and aesthetic response, as in science and in certain kinds of philosophy, must be attended by a quickening and intensity of these other parts of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. In science and critical thought, where this isolation is possible, the objective turn prevailed,—though much that we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> critical thought is after all a personal construction, a use of the reason and the observation of things for a view of what is around us which, far from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> really disinterested and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>, is a creation of our own temperament and a satisfaction of our intellectualised individuality. But in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>artistic creation</span> where the isolation is not possible, we find quite an opposite phenomenon, the subjective personality of the poet asserting itself to a far greater extent than in former ages of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>.\n\nGoethe himself, in spite of his theory, could not escape from this tendency; his work, as he himself recognised, is always an act of reflection of the subjective changes of his personality, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the development of his own soul in the guise of objective creation. From the work of a poet like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Leconte de Lisle</span> who attempted with the most deliberate conscientiousness a perfect fidelity to the ideal of an impersonal artistic objectiveness, there disengages itself in the mass an almost poignant impression of<span class='page-number' id='s-117' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.117]</span> the strong subjective personality shaping everything into a mask-reflection of its own characteristic moods; the attempt to live in the thoughts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of other men, other civilisations betrays itself as only the multiple imaginative and sympathetic extension of the poet's own psychology. This peculiarity of the age is noticeable even in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> creators whose aim is deliberately realistic or their method founded upon a minute psychological observation, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ibsen</span> or Tolstoy and the Russian novelists. The self of the creator very visibly overshadows the work, is seen everywhere like the conscious self of Vedanta both containing and inhabiting all his creations. Shakespeare succeeds, as far as a poet can, in veiling himself behind his creatures; he gives us at least the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of mirroring the world around him, a world universally represented rather than personally and individually thought and imaged, and at any rate the Life-spirit sees and creates in him through a faithful reflecting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, quite sufficiently universal and impersonal for its dramatic purpose even in his personality. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poet who best represented the spirit of the age in its temperament of curious observation and its aim at a certain force of large and yet minute reality, who was eminently a poet of life observed and understood and of thought playing around the observation, as Shakespeare was the poet of life seen through an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> of feeling with it and of thought arising up out of the surge of life,—Browning, though he seems to have considered this self-concealment especially admirable and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the Shakespearian method of creation, fails himself to achieve it in anything like the same measure. The self-conscious thinking of the modern mind which brings into prominent relief the rest of the mental personality and stamps the whole work with it, gets into his way; everywhere we feel the presence of the creator bringing forward his living puppets, analysing, commenting, thinking about them or else about life through a variation of many voices so that they become as much his masks as his creations.\n\nThus both the subjective personality of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and the artistic personality of the creator tend to count for much more in modern work than at any previous time; the poet is a much<span class='page-number' id='s-118' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.118]</span> greater part of his work. It is doubtful whether we have not altogether lost the old faculty of impersonal self-effacement in the creation which was so common in the ancient and mediaeval ages when many men working in one spirit could build great universal works of combined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span>, painting and sculpture or in literature the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> or romantic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cycles</span> or lyric cycles like the Vedic Mandalas or the mass of Vaishnava poetry. Even when there are definite schools marked by a common method, we do not find, as in the old French romance writers or the Elizabethan dramatists or the poets of the eighteenth century, a spiritual resemblance which overshadows <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> differences; in the moderns the technical method may have in all similar motives, but difference of subjective treatment so stresses its values as to prevent all spiritual unity. There is here a gain which more than compensates any loss; but we have to note the cause, a growth of subjectivism, an enhanced force, enrichment and insistence of the inner personality.\n\nThis trend, though for some time held back from its full development by the aim at the objective method, betrays itself in that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of close and minute psychological observation which pervades the work of the time. There too the modern mind has left far behind all the preceding ages. Although most prominent in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span>, the characteristic has laid some hold too on poetry. Compared with its work all previous creation seems psychologically poor both in richness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> and in subtlety and the depth of its vision; half the work of Shakespeare in spite of its larger and greater treatment hardly contains as much on this side as a single volume of Browning. Realism has carried this new trend to the farthest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> possible to a professedly objective method, stressing minute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span>, forcing the emphasis of extreme notes, but in so doing it has opened to the creative mind of the age a door of escape from realism. For, in the first place, while in the representation of outward objects, of action, of character and temperament thrown out in self-expressive movement we may with success affect the method of a purely objective observation, from the moment we begin to psychologise deeply, we are at once preparing to go back into<span class='page-number' id='s-119' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.119]</span> ourselves. For it is only through our own psychology, through its power of response to and of identification with the mind and soul in others that we can know their inner psychology; for the most part our psychological account of others is only an account of the psychological impressions of them they produce in our own mentality. This we see even in the realistic writers in the strongly personal and limited way in which they render the psychology of their creatures in one or two always recurring main notes upon which they ring minute variations. In the end the creative mind could not fail to become conscious of this self within which was really doing the whole work and to turn to it for a theme or for the mould of its psychological creations, to a conscious intimate subjectivism. Again, the emphasising of extreme notes brings us to a point where to go farther we have to go within and to make ourselves a sort of laboratory of new psychological experiment and discovery.\n\nThis is the turn we get in the poetry of Verlaine which is throughout a straining after an intimate and subtle experience of the senses, vital sensations, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> pushed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> ordinary limits into a certain vivid and revealing abnormality, in the earlier work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maeterlinck</span> which is not so much an action of personalities as the drama of a childlike <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> uttering half inarticulate cries of love and longing, terror and distress and emotion, in the work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mallarmé</span> where there is a constant seeking for subjective symbols which will reveal to our own soul the soul of the things that we see. The rediscovery of the soul is the last stage of the round described by this age of the intellect and reason. It is at first mainly the perceptions of a desire-soul, a soul of sense and sensation and emotion, and an arriving through them at a sort of psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span>, a psychism which is not yet true mysticism, much less spirituality, but is still a movement of the lower self in that direction. The movement could not stop here: the emergence of the higher perceptions of a larger and purer psychical and intuitive entity in direct contact with the Spirit could not but come, and this greater impulse is represented by the work of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Irish poets</span>. It is the sign of the end, now in sight, of a purely intellectual modernism and the<span class='page-number' id='s-120' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.120]</span> coming of a new age of creation, intellectualism fulfilled ceasing by a self-exceeding in a greater motive of intuitive art and poetry.\n\nThus this wide movement of interests, so many-sided and universal, in man past and present after embracing all that attracts the observing eye in his life and history and apparent nature comes back to a profounder interest in the movements of his deeper self which reveals itself to an extended psychological experience and an intuitive sense. But an insistent interest in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> man has been the most novel, the most fruitfully distinguishing characteristic of the modern mind. Once limited to the far-off dream of religions or the distant speculation of isolated thinkers, the attempt to cast a seeing eye as well as a shaping will on the future is now an essential side of the human outlook. Formerly the human mentality of the present lived in the great shadow thrown on it by its past, nowadays on the contrary it turns more to some image of coming possibility. The colour of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>futurism</span> has changed with the changes of modern intellectualism. At first it came in on the wave of a partly naturalistic, partly transcendentalist idealism, a reverie of the perfected individual and the perfected society, and was commonly associated with the passion for civic or the idea of a spiritual and personal liberty. A more sober colouring intervened, the intellectual constructions of positivism, liberalism, utilitarian thought which were soon in their turn followed by broader democratic and socialistic utopias. Touched sometimes with an aesthetic and idealistic colouring, they have grown for a time more scientific, economic, practical with the advance of realism and rationalism. But the new force of subjectivism will have probably the effect of rehabilitating the religious and spiritually idealistic element in our vision of the future of the race. Poetry, which has been less able to follow this stream of thought than prose literature, will find its account in the change; for it will be the natural interpreter of this more inner and intuitive vision. The futurist outlook has never been more pronounced than at the present day; on all sides, in thought, in life, in the motives and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of literary and artistic creation, we are swinging violently away from the past into an unprecedented adventure of new teeming<span class='page-number' id='s-121' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.121]</span> possibilities. Never has the past counted so little for its own sake,—its tradition is still effectual only when it can be made a power or an inspiration for the future; never has the present looked so persistently and creatively forward.\n\nBut Nature and man in his active, intellectual and emotional life and physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> are not the whole subject of man's thought or of his creative presentment of his mind's seeings and imaginings. He has been even more passionately occupied by the idea of things beyond, other worlds and an after life, symbols and powers of that which exceeds him or of his own self-exceeding, the cult of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> of nature and supernature, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> in or the seeking after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>. On this side of the human mind modern literature, though not a blank, has been during the greater part of the nineteenth century inferior in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> and in its power, because it has been an age of scepticism and of denial or else of a doubtful and tormented, a merely intellectual or a conventional clinging to the residuum of past beliefs. They have not formed a real and vital part of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and what is not real or vital to thought, imagination and feeling cannot be powerfully creative. At first this ebb of positive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> was to some extent compensated by the ideal element of a philosophic transcendentalism, vague and indefinite but with its own large light and force of inspiration. As scepticism became more positive, this light fades, the most poetic notes of the age which deal with the foundations of life are either the poignant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of a regretful scepticism, or a defiant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>atheism</span> exulting in the revolt of the great denial, the hymn of the Void, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nihil</span> which has taken the place of God, or else the large idea of Nature as a universal entity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> of our being. To Science this Nature is only an inconscient Force; the poetic mind with its natural turn for finding a reality even behind what are to the intellect abstract conceptions, has passed through this conception to a new living sense of the universal, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>. It has even evolved from it now and then a vivid pantheism. The difficult self-defence or reaction of the old faiths against the prevalent scepticism and intellectualism has given too some minor notes; but these are the greater voices of negation and affirmation in this sphere<span class='page-number' id='s-122' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.122]</span> of poetic thought and creation which have added some novel and powerful strains to poetry. With the return to subjective intuition and a fresh adventuring of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and imagination into the beyond modern poetry, freed from the sceptical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span>, is beginning in this field too to turn the balance in its favour as against the old classical and mediaeval literature. The vision of the worlds beyond which it is gaining is nearer, less grossly human, more supernatural to physical Nature; the symbols it is beginning to create and its reinterpretation of the old symbols are more adequate and more revealing; rid of the old insufficient forms and limiting creeds, it is admitting a near, direct and fearless seeing and experience of God in Nature, God in man, God in the universal and the eternal. From faith it has advanced through the valley of doubt to the heights of a more luminous knowledge. These are the main movements of the modern mind constituting the turns of a psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of the most rapid and remarkable kind which have dominated the literature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>, now more than ever before growing into a single though varied whole. We have to see how they have worked themselves out in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> during this period.

Elizabethan poetry was the work of the life-spirit in a new, raw and vigorous people not yet tamed by a restraining and formative culture, a people with the crude tendencies of the occidental mind rioting almost in the exuberance of a state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. The poetry of the classical Sanskrit writers was the work of Asiatic minds, scholars, court-poets in an age of<span class='page-number' id='s-125' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.125]</span> immense intellectual development and an excessive, almost over-cultivated refinement, but still that too was a poetry of the life-spirit. In spite of a broad gulf of difference we yet find an extraordinary basic kinship between these two very widely separated great ages of poetry, though there was never any possibility of contact between that earlier <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oriental</span> and this later occidental work,—the dramas of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kalidasa</span> and some of the dramatic romances of Shakespeare, plays like the Sanskrit *Seal of Rakshasa* and *Toy-Cart* and Elizabethan historic and melodramatic pieces, the poetry of the *Cloud-Messenger* and erotic Elizabethan poetry, the romantically vivid and descriptive narrative method of Spenser's *Faerie Queene* and the more intellectually romantic vividness and descriptive elaborateness of the *Line of Raghu*, the tone and manner of Drayton and that of the much greater work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bharavi</span>.

A poetry of spiritual vision and the sense of things behind life and above the intellect must similarly develop from its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> a characteristic voice, cry, mould of speech, natural way of development, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of structure.\n\nThe great poets of this earlier endeavour had all to deal with the same central problem of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and were embarrassed by the same difficulty of a time which was not ready for work of this kind, not prepared for it by any past development, not fitted for it by anything in the common atmosphere of the age. They breathed the rarity of heights lifted far <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the level of the contemporary surrounding temperament, intellect and life.

Each followed his own way, was very little influenced by the others, was impelled by a quite distinct spiritual idea, worked it out in a quite individual method and, when he fell away from it or short of it, failed in his own way and by shortcomings peculiar to his own nature.

An intellectualism which takes this turn can choose one of three methods. It may prolong the language and forms it already possesses and trust to the weight of the thing it has to say and the power of its vision to inform this vehicle with another spirit. It may strain, heighten, transfigure the language and forms into a more intensive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of image, mould and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. Or it may strive for some new and direct tone, some sheer cry of intuitive speech and sound born from the spirit itself and coming near to its native harmonies. The moulds too may either be the established moulds turned or modified to a greater and subtler use or else strange unprecedented frames, magical products of a spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. On any of these lines the poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> may arrive at its objective and cross the borders of a greater kingdom of experience and expression.\n\nBut these earlier poets came in an age of imperfect, unenriched and uncompleted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span>. The language which they inherited was admirable for clear and balanced prose speech, but in poetry had been used only for adequate or vigorous statement, rhetorical reasoning, superficial sentimentalising or ornate thought, narrative, description in the manner of a concentrated, elevated and eloquent prose. The forms and rhythmical movements were unsuitable for any imaginative, flexible or subtly feeling poetry. The new writers dealt with the forms of the preceding literary age by a clear and complete rejection; they swept them aside and created new forms or took old ones from the earlier masters or from song and ballad moulds modified or developed to serve a more fluid and intellectualised mind and imagination. But the language was a more difficult problem and could not be entirely solved by such short cuts as Wordsworth's recipe of a resort to the straightforward force of the simplest speech dependent on the weight of the substance and thought<span class='page-number' id='s-129' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.129]</span> for its one sufficient source of power. We find the tongue of this period floating between various possibilities. On its lower levels it is weighted down by some remnant of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the eighteenth century and proceeds by a stream of eloquence, no longer artificial, but facile, fluid, helped by a greater force of thought and imagination. This turn sometimes rises to a higher level of inspired and imaginative poetic eloquence. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> this pitch we have a fuller and richer style packed with thought and imaginative substance, the substitute of this new intellectualised poetic mind for the more spontaneous Elizabethan richness and curiosity; but imaginative thought is the secret of its power, no longer the exuberance of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> in its vision. On the other side we have a quite different note, a sheer poetical directness, which sometimes sinks below itself to poverty and insufficiency or at least to thinness, as in much of the work of Wordsworth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span>, but, when better supported and rhythmed, rises to quite new authenticities of great or perfect utterance, and out of this there comes in some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> moments a native voice of the spirit, in Wordsworth's revelations of the spiritual presence in Nature and its scenes and peoples, in Byron's rare forceful sincerities, in the luminous simplicities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Blake</span>, in the faery melodies of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Coleridge</span>, most of all perhaps in the lyrical cry and ethereal light of Shelley. But these are comparatively rare moments, the mass of their work is less certain and unequal in expression and significance. Finally we get in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> a turning away to a rich, artistic and sensuous poetical speech marvellous in its perfection of opulence, resource and colour which prepares us for the more various but lower fullnesses of the intellectual and aesthetic epoch that had to intervene. The greatest intuitive and revealing poetry has yet to come.\n\nByron and Wordsworth are the two poets who are the most hampered by this difficulty of finding and keeping to the native speech of their greater self, most often depressed in their elevation, because they are both drawn by a strong side of their nature, the one to a forceful, the other to a weighty intellectualised expression; neither of them are born singers or artists of word and sound, neither of them poets in the whole grain of their<span class='page-number' id='s-130' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.130]</span> mind and temperament, not, that is to say, always dominated by the aesthetic, imaginative or inspired strain in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>, but doubled here by a man of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and passion, there by a moralist and preacher, in each too a would-be \"critic of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>\", who gets into the way of the poet and makes upon him illegitimate demands; therefore they are readily prone to fall away to what is, however interesting it may otherwise be, a lower, a not genuinely poetic range of substance and speech. But both in the deepest centre or on the highest peak of their inspiration are moved by powers for which their heavily or forcibly intellectualised language of poetry was no adequate means. It is only when they escape from it that they do their rare highest work. Byron, no artist, intellectually shallow and hurried, a poet by compulsion of personality rather than in the native colour of his mind, inferior in all these respects to the finer strain of his great contemporaries, but in compensation a more powerful elemental force than any of them and more in touch with all that had begun to stir in the mind of the times,—always an advantage, if one knows how to make use of it, for a poet's largeness and ease of execution,—succeeds more amply on the inferior levels of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>, but fails more in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> an adequate voice to his highest possibility. Wordsworth, meditative, inward, concentrated in his thought, is more often able by force of brooding to bring out the voice of his greater self, but flags constantly, brings in a heavier <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> surrounding his few great clear tones, drowns his genius at last in a desolate sea of platitude. Neither arrives at that amplitude of achievement which might have been theirs in a more fortunate time, if ready forms had been given to them, or if they had lived in the stimulating atmosphere of a contemporary culture harmonious with their personality.\n\nByron's prodigious reputation, greater and more prolonged on the continent than in his own country, led perhaps to too severely critical an undervaluing when his defects became nakedly patent in the fading away of the helpful glamour of contemporary sympathies. That is the penalty of an exaggerated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> lifted too high on the wings or the winds of the moment. But his fame was no accident or caprice of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span>; it was his due<span class='page-number' id='s-131' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.131]</span> from the Time-Spirit. His hasty vehement personality caught up and crowded into its work in a strong though intellectually crude expression an extraordinary number of the powers and motives of the modern age. The passion for liberty found in him its voice of Tyrrhenian bronze. The revolt and self-assertion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> against the falsities and stifling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conventions</span> of society, denial, unbelief, the scorn of the sceptic for established things, the romance of the past, the restlessness of the present, the groping towards the future, the sensuous, glittering, artificial romance of the pseudo-East, the romance of the solitary, the rebel, the individual exaggerated to himself by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loneliness</span>, the immoral or amoral superman, all that flawed romanticism, passionate sentimentalism, insatiable satiety of sensualism, cynicism, realism which are the chaotic fermentation of an old world dying and a new world in process of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>,—a century and a half's still unfinished process,—caught hold of his mood and unrolled itself before the dazzled, astonished and delighted eyes of his contemporaries in the rapid succession of forcibly illhewn works impatiently cut out or fierily molten from his single personality in a few crowded years from its first rhetorical and struggling outburst in *Childe Harold* to the accomplished ease of its finale in *Don Juan*. Less than this apparent plenitude would have been enough to create the rumour that rose around the outbreak of this singular and rapid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>. No doubt, his intellectual understanding of these things was thin and poverty-stricken in the extreme, his poetic vision of the powers that moved him had plenty of force, but wanted depth and form and greatness. But he brought to his work what no other poet could give and what the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> of the time, moved itself by things which it had not sufficient intellectual preparation to grasp, was fitted to appreciate, the native elemental force, the personality, the strength of nervous and vital feeling of them which they just then needed and which took the place of understanding and vision. To this pervading power, to this lava flood of passion and personality, were added certain preeminent gifts, a language at first of considerable rhetorical weight and drive, afterwards of great nervous strength, directness, precision, force<span class='page-number' id='s-132' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.132]</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, a power of narrative and of vivid presentation, and always, whatever else might lack, an unfailing energy. It was enough for the immediate thing he had to do, though not at all enough for the highest assured <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>.\n\nThese things which Byron more or less adequately expressed, were the ferment of the mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> in its first crude attempt to shake off the conventions of the past and struggle towards a direct feeling of itself and its surrounding world in their immediate reality. But behind it there is something else which seems sometimes about to emerge vaguely, an element which may be called spiritual, a feeling of the greatness of man the individual spirit commensurate with Nature and his world, man in communion with the greatness of Nature, man able to stand in the world in his own strength and puissance, man affirming his liberty, the claim to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of a force as great within as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> which surround and seem to overwhelm him. One feels oneself as if in the presence of a Titan striving to be born, a Titanism of the spirit of man awake in its soul of desire, in a passion of seeking without conquest of finding, in revolt, not in self-possession, man the fallen archangel, not man returning to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span>: but it reposes on, it is the obscure side of a spiritual reality. He could not break through the obstructions of his lower personality and express this thing that he felt in its native tones of largeness and power. If he could have done so, his work would have been of a lasting greatness. But he never found the right form, never achieved the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> into right thought and speech of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Daemon</span> within him. The language and movement he started from were an intellectual and sentimental rhetoric, the speech of the eighteenth century broken down, melted and beaten into new shape for stronger uses; he went on to a more chastened and rapid style of great force, but void of delicacy, subtlety and variety; he ended in a flexible and easy tongue which gave power to even the most cynical trivialities and could rise to heights of poetry and passion: but none of these things, however adapted to his other gifts, was the style wanted for this greater utterance. Art, structure, accomplished mould were needs of which he had no idea; neither the weight of a deep<span class='page-number' id='s-133' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.133]</span> and considered, nor the sureness of an inspired interpretation were at his command. But sometimes language and movement rise suddenly into a bare and powerful sincerity which, if he could have maintained it, would have given him the needed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>: but the patience and artistic conscientiousness or the feeling for poetic truth which could alone have done this, were far from him. Considerable work of a secondary kind he did, but he had something greater to say which he never said, but only gave rare hints of it and an obscured sense of the presence of its meaning.\n\nWordsworth, with a much higher poetic mind than Byron's, did not so entirely miss his greatest way, though he wandered much in adjacent paths and finally lost himself in the dry desert sands of the uninspired intellectual mentality. At the beginning he struck in the midst of some alloy full into his purest vein of gold. His earliest vision of his task was the right vision, and whatever may be the general truth of his philosophy of childhood in the great Ode, it seems to have been true of him. For as intellectuality grew on him, the vision failed; the first clear intimations dimmed and finally passed leaving behind an unillumined waste of mere thought and moralising. But always, even from the beginning, it got into the way of his inspiration. Yet Wordsworth was not a wide thinker, though he could bring a considerable weight of thought to the aid of the two or three great things he felt and saw lucidly and deeply, and he was unfitted to be a critic of life of which he could only see one side with power and originality,—for the rest he belongs to his age rather than to the future and is limited in his view of religion, of society, of man by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> walls of convention. But what the poet sees and feels, not what he opines, is the real substance of his poetry. Wordsworth saw Nature and he saw man near to Nature, and when he speaks of these things, he finds either his noblest or his purest and most penetrating tones. His view of them is native to his temperament and personality and at the opposite pole to Byron's. Not that which is wild, dynamic or tumultuously great in Nature, but her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, her serenity, the soul of peace, the tranquil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, the still, near,<span class='page-number' id='s-134' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.134]</span> intimate voice that speaks from flower and bird, sky and star, mountain and stream, this he knew, felt and lived in as no poet before or after him has done, with a spiritual closeness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> which is of the nature of a revelation, the first spiritual revelation of this high near kind to which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry had given voice. Some soul of man, too, he sees, not in revolt,—he has written unforgettable lines about liberty, but a calm and ordered liberty,—in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with this tranquil soul in Nature, finding in it some original simplicity and purity of his being and founding on it a life in tune with the order of an eternal law. On this perception the moralist in Wordsworth founds a rule of simple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, truth, piety, self-control, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span>, grave gladness in which the sentimental naturalism of the eighteenth century disappears into an ethical naturalism, a very different idealisation of humanity in the simplicity of its direct contact with Nature unspoiled by the artifice and corruption of a too developed society. All that Wordsworth has to say worth saying is confined to these motives and from them he draws his whole genuine thought inspiration.\n\nBut it is in the Nature strain of which he is the discoverer that he is unique, for it is then that the seer in him either speaks the revelatory thought of his spirit or gives us strains greater than thought's, the imperishable substance of spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> finding itself in sight and speech. At other times, especially when he fuses this Nature-strain with his thought and ethical motive, he writes sometimes poetry of the very greatest; at others again it is of a varying worth and merit; but too often also he passes out from his uninspired <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> work with no stamp of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span>, much less of the true immortality. In the end the poet in him died while the man and the writer lived on; the moralist and concentred thinker had killed the singer, the intellect had walled up the issues of the imagination and spiritual vision. But even from the beginning there is an inequality and uncertainty which betray an incomplete fusion of the sides of his personality, and the heavy weight of intellectuality shadows over and threatens the spiritual light which it eventually extinguished. A certain number of his shorter poems rank among the greatest things<span class='page-number' id='s-135' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.135]</span> in poetry and this number is not inconsiderable. But elsewhere he rises high, sometimes astonishingly high, for a few lines but cannot keep long to the high poetic expression and sometimes can sink low and sometimes astonishingly low, even to bathos and triviality, especially when he strains towards an excessive simplicity which can become puerile or worse. He intellectualises his poetic statement overmuch and in fact states too much and sings too little, has a dangerous turn for a too obvious sermonising, pushes too far his reliance on the worth of his substance and is not jealously careful to give it a form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. In his works of long breath there are terrible stretches of flattest prose in verse with lines of power, sometimes of fathomless depth like that wonderful\n\n>Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone,\n\ninterspersed or occurring like a lonely and splendid accident, *rari nantes in gurgite vasto*.[^1] It has been said with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> that he talks too much in verse and sings too little; there is a deficient sense of the more subtle spirit of rhythm, a deficiency which he overcomes when moved or lifted up, but which at other times, hampers greatly his effectiveness. His theory of poetic diction, though it has a certain truth in it, was, as he practised it, narrow and turned to unsoundness; it betrayed him into the power of the prosaic and intellectual element in his mind. These defects grew on him as the reflective moralist and monk and the conventional citizen,—there was always in him this curious amalgam,—prevailed over the seer and poet.\n\n[^1]: \"Rare swimming in the vast gurge.\"\n\nBut still one of the seer-poets he is, a seer of the calm spirit in Nature, the poet of man's large identity with her and serene liberating communion: it is on this side that he is admirable and unique. He has other strains too of great power. His chosen form of diction, often too bare and trivial in the beginning, too heavy afterwards, helps him at his best to a language and movement of unsurpassed poetic weight and gravity charged with imaginative insight, in which his thought and his ethical<span class='page-number' id='s-136' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.136]</span> sense and spiritual sight meet in a fine harmony, as in his one great Ode, in some of his sonnets, in *Ruth*, even in *Laodamia*, in lines and passages which uplift and redeem much of his less satisfying work, while when the inner light shines wholly out, it admits him to the secret of the very self-revealing voice of Nature herself speaking through the human personality in some closest intimacy with her or else uttering the greatness of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> sight and truth. He has transparencies in which the spirit gets free of the life-wave, the intelligence, the coloured veils of the imagination, and poetic speech and rhythm become hints of the eternal movements and the eternal stabilities, voices of the depths, rare moments of speech direct from our hidden immortality.<span class='page-number' id='s-137' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.137]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-poets-of-the-dawn-ii","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Poets of the Dawn - III","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-poets-of-the-dawn-iii","prvt":"The Poets of the Dawn - I","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-poets-of-the-dawn-i","subt":"Byron and Wordsworth","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-poets-of-the-dawn-iii"],"t":"The Poets of the Dawn - III","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"If Wordsworth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> failed by an excess of the alloy of untransmuted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> in their work, two other poets of the time, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Blake</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Coleridge</span>, miss the highest greatness they might otherwise have attained by an opposite defect, by want of the gravity and enduring substance which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of thought gives to the poetical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>.

They have the faculty of revelatory sense in a high degree, but little of the revelatory thought which should go with it; or at least though they can suggest this sometimes with the intense force which comes from spiritual feeling, they cannot command it and constantly give it greatness and distinctness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. And their sight is only of the middle kind; it is not the highest things they see, but only those of a borderland or middle region. Their poetry has a strange and unique quality and charm, but it stops short of something which would have made it supreme. They are poets of the supernatural and of such spiritual truth as may be shadowed by it or penetrate through it, but not of the greatest truths of the spirit. And this supernature remains in them a thing seen indeed and objectively real, but abnormal; but it is only when supernature becomes normal to the inner experience that it can be turned into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> of the very greatest poetry.\n\nColeridge more than any of his great contemporaries missed his poetic crown; he has only found and left to us three or four scattered jewels of a strange and singular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. The rest of his work is a failure. There is a disparateness in his gifts, an inconsequence and incoherence which prevented him from bringing them together, aiding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> with the other and producing<span class='page-number' id='s-138' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.138]</span> great work rich in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Intellectuality</span> he had in abundance, a wide, rich and subtle intellect, but he squandered rather than used it in discursive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphysics</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span> and was most at home when pouring it out in the spontaneity of conversation or rather monologue, an outlet in which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> it the firmness of an enduring form could be avoided. The poet in him never took into himself the thinker. The consequence is that very much the greater part of his poetry, though his whole production is small enough in bulk, is unconvincing in the extreme. It has at best a certain eloquence or a turn of phrase and image which has some intellectual finish but not either force or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span>, or a fluidity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which fails to hold the ear. But there are three poems of his which are unique in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry, written in moments when the too active intellect was in abeyance, an occult eye of dream and vision opened to supraphysical worlds and by a singular felicity the other senses harmonised, the speech caught strange subtleties and marvellous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> and hues and the ear the melodies of other realms. It is indeed only just over the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> border that his sight penetrates and to its most inferior <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, and he does not enter into these worlds as did Blake, but catches only their light and influence upon the earth <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>; but it is caught with a truth and intensity which makes magical the scenes and movements of the earth life and transforms light of physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> into light of supernature. This is to say that for the first time, except for rare intimations, the middle worlds and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> have been seen and described with something of reality and no longer in the crude <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> of vulgar tradition or in the forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>myth</span>. The Celtic genius of second sight has begun to make its way into poetry. It is by these poems that he lives, though he has also two or three others of a more human charm and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span>; but here Coleridge shows within narrow limits a superlative power and brings in a new element and opens a new field in the realms of poetic vision.\n\nBlake lives ordinarily far up in this middle world of which Coleridge only catches some glimpses or at most stands occasionally just over its border. Blake's seeing teems with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> of<span class='page-number' id='s-139' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.139]</span> this other world, he hears around him the echoes of its sounds and voices. He is not only a seer, but almost an inhabitant of other planes, another domain of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>; or at least this second subtle sight is his normal sight. His power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> is akin in its strangeness to his eye of vision. His speech like his seeing has a singular other-world clarity and sheerness of expression in it, the light of supernature. When he prophetises as in some of his more ambitious efforts, he mentalises too much the mystic and misses the marvel and the magic. It is when he casts into some echo of the language of the luminous children of those shores the songs of their childhood and their innocence, that he becomes limpid to us and sheds upon our earth some clear charm, felicity, wonder of a half <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> otherwhere. Here again we have something unique, a voice of things which had not been heard before nor has it been heard since; for the Celtic poets who sometimes give us something that is in its source akin, bring a ripe reflective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and a colour of intellectuality into their speech and vision, but Blake seeks to put away from him as much as possible the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectual mind</span>, to see only and sing. By this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and his singularity and absorption he stands apart solitary and remote, a unique voice among the poets of the time; he occupies indeed a place unique in the poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>, for there is no other singer of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> who is like him or equal to him in the strangeness, supernatural lucidity, power and directness of vision of the beyond and the rhythmic clarity and beauty of his singing.\n\nA greater poet by nature than almost any of these, Shelley was alone of them all very nearly fitted to be a sovereign voice of the new spiritual force that was at the moment attempting to break into poetry and possess there its kingdom. He has on the one hand, one feels, been a native of the heights to which he aspires and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of them, not indeed quite distinct, but still environing his imagination with its luminous ethereality, is yet with him. If the idea of a being not of our soil fallen into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material life</span> and still remembering his skies can be admitted as an actual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, then Shelley was certainly a living example of one of these luminous spirits half obscured by earth;<span class='page-number' id='s-140' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.140]</span> the very stumblings of his life came from the difficulty of such a nature moving in the alien terrestrial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> in which he is not at home nor capable of accepting its muddy vesture and iron chain, attempting impatiently to realise there the law of his own being in spite of the obstruction of the physical clay. This mind and nature cannot live at ease in their dusk day and time, but escape to dwell prophetically in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> heaven and earth in which the lower life shall have accepted the law of his own celestial worlds. As a poet his intellect is suffused with their light and his imagination is bathed in it; they are steeped in the brilliances of a communion with a higher law, another <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, another meaning behind Nature and terrestrial things. But in addition he possesses the intellectual equipment possible in his age and can speak with a subtle beauty and perfect melody the tongue of the poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. He is a seer of spiritual realities, much more radiantly near to them than Wordsworth, has, what Coleridge had not, a poetic grasp of metaphysical truths, can see the forms and hear the voices of higher elemental spirits and natural godheads than those seen and heard by Blake, while he has a knowledge too of some fields of the same middle realm, is the singer of a greater and deeper liberty and a purer and nobler revolt than Byron, has the constant feeling of a high spiritual and intellectual beauty, not sensuous in the manner of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>, but with a hold on the subtler beauty of sensible things which gives us not their glow of vital warmth and close material texture, but their light and life and the rarer atmosphere that environs them on some meeting line between spirit and body. He is at once seer, poet, thinker, prophet, artist. In his own day and after, the strangeness of his genius made him unintelligible to the rather gross and mundane intellectual mind of the nineteenth century; those who admired him most, were seized only by the externalities of his work, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, delicacy, diffusely lavish imaginative opulence, enthusiasm, but missed its inner significance. Now that we are growing more into the shape of his ideas and the forms of his seeing, we can get nearer to the hidden <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of his poetry. Still high-pinnacled as is his flight, great as is his work and his name, there is in him too a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span><span class='page-number' id='s-141' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.141]</span> which prevents the perfect self-expression that we find only in the few supreme poets.\n\nThis was due to the conditions under which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of his poetry had to take place and to the early <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> which found him at the time when it was rounding towards the full orb of its maturity. His earlier poetry shows him striving with the difficulty of the too intellectual manner of speech from which these poets of supra-intellectual truth had to take their departure. Shelley uses language throughout as a poet; he was incapable of falling into the too hard and outward manner of Byron or yielding to the turn towards mere intellectuality which always beset Wordsworth. The grain of his mind was too saturated with the hues of poetic vision, he had too splendid and opulent an imagination, too great a gift of flowing and yet uplifted and inspired speech for such descents, and even in his earlier immature poetry, *Queen Mab, Alastor, The Revolt of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span>*, these powers are there and sustain him, but still the first form of his diction is a high, sometimes a magnificent poetic eloquence, which sometimes enforces the effect of what he has to say, but more often loses it in a flood of diffuse and overabundant expression. It is not yet the native language of his spirit. As his power develops, the eloquence remains, but is subdued to the growing splendour of his vision and its hints and images, but the thought seems almost to disappear from the concrete grasp of the intelligence into a wonder of light and a music of marvellous sound. The *Prometheus* and *Epipsychidion* show this turn of his genius at its height; they are two of the three greatest things he has left to us on the larger scale. Here he does come near to something like the natural speech of his strange, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and ethereal spirit; but the one thing that is wanting is a more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> force of *tapasyā* economising and compressing its powers to bring in a new full and seizing expression of the thought element in his poetry, not merely opulent and eloquent or bright with the rainbow hues of imagination, but sovereign in poetic perfection and mastery. Towards this need his later style is turning, but except once in *Adonais* he does not seize on the right subject <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> for his genius. Only in the lyric of which he has always<span class='page-number' id='s-142' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.142]</span> the secret,—for of all English poets he has perhaps the most natural, spontaneous, sweet and unfailing gift of melody, and his emotion and lyrical cry are at once of the most delicate and the most intense,—is he frequently and constantly equal alike in his thought, feeling, imagery, music. But it is not often that he uses the pure lyrical form for his greatest sight, for what would now be called his \"message\". When he turns to that, he attempts always a larger and more expansive form. The greatness of *Prometheus Unbound* which remains, when all is said, his supreme effort and one of the masterpieces of poetry, arises from the combination of this larger endeavour and profounder substance with the constant use of the lyrical mould in which he most excelled, because it agreed with the most intimate turn of his temperament and subtly exalted spirit.\n\nThe spiritual truth which had possession of Shelley's mind was higher than anything opened to the vision of any of his contemporaries, and its power and reality which was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of his inspiration can only be grasped, when it is known and lived, by a changed and future <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. Light, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>, Liberty are the three godheads in whose presence his pure and radiant spirit lived; but a celestial light, a celestial love, a celestial liberty. To bring them down to earth without their losing their celestial lustre and hue is his passionate endeavour, but his wings constantly buoy him upward and cannot beat strongly in an earthlier atmosphere. The effort and the unconquered difficulty are the cause of the ethereality, the want of firm earthly reality that some complain of in his poetry. There is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> of luminous mist surrounding his intellectual presentation of his meaning which shows the truths he sees as things to which the mortal eye cannot easily pierce or the life and temperament of earth rise to realise and live; yet to bring about the union of the mortal and the immortal, the terrestrial and the celestial is always his passion. He is himself too much at war with his age to ignore its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contradictions</span> and pass onward to the reconciliation. He has to deny <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in order to affirm the Divine, and his denial brings in a note too high, discordant and shrill. He has not the symbols or the thought-forms through which he can make the spirit of<span class='page-number' id='s-143' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.143]</span> light, love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> intimate and near to men; he has, as in the *Prometheus*, to go for them to his imagination or to some remote luminous experience of ideal worlds and to combine these beautiful ideal images, too delicately profound in their significance, too veiled in robe upon robe of light to be distinct in limb and form, with traditional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> and symbols which are converted into this other sense and fail to be perfect links because by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> they cease to be familiar to the mind. To bring his difficult significance home he lavishes inexhaustibly image on radiant image, line on dazzling beauty of line, the sense floats in a storm of coruscations and dissolving star-showers; the more we look and accustom our eyes to this new kind of light, the more loveliness and light we see, but there is not that immediate seizing and taking captive of the whole intelligence which is the sign of an assured and sufficient utterance.\n\nHe is in revolt too against the law of earth, in arms against its dominations and powers, and would substitute for it by some immediate and magical change the law of heaven; but so he fails to make the needed transition and reconciliation and his image of the thing to be remains too ideal, too fine and abstract in spite of the beauty of the poetical forms he gives it as its raiment or atmosphere. Heaven cannot descend to take possession of the gross, brute and violent earth he sees around him, therefore he carries up the delivered earth into a far and ideal heaven. Something of the same excess of another light than ours surrounds and veils his intercourse with the spirit in Nature. He sees her earthly forms in a peculiar radiance and light and through them the forms and spirits of his ideal world. He has not Wordsworth's distinctness and intimate spiritual communion with Nature as she is on earth; the genii of the worlds of dream and sleep cluster too thickly round all that his waking eye seizes. He tries to let them in through the force of crowding images, brilliant tossings aside of the lucent curtain, *tiraskariṇī*, which veils them from us: but they remain half-hidden in their means of revelation. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span> is seen in the light of another nature more than in its own, and that too is only half visible in the mixed luminosity, \"burning through the vest that hides it.\" Tradition governs very<span class='page-number' id='s-144' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.144]</span> largely his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of rhythms, but wonderfully melodious as is his use or conversion of them to the mould of his spirit, one feels that he would have done better to seek more often for self-formed movements. Shelley is the bright archangel of this dawn and he becomes greater to us as the light he foresaw and lived in returns and grows, but he sings half concealed in the too dense halo of his own ethereal beauty.\n\nAs with Wordsworth and Byron, so too we find Shelley and Keats standing side by side, but with a certain antinomy. They are perhaps the two most purely poetic minds that have used the English tongue; but one sings from the skies earthwards, the other looks from earth towards Olympus. Keats is the first entire artist in word and rhythm in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>,—not grandiose, classical and derived like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>, but direct and original in his artistry, he begins a new era. His astonishing early performance leaves us wondering what might have been the masterpieces of his prime, of which even *Hyperion* and the Odes are only the unfulfilled promise. His death in the beginning of his powers is the greatest loss ever suffered by human achievement in this field. Alone of all the chief poets of his time he is in possession of a perfect or almost perfected <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of his native temperament and genius, but he had not yet found the thing he had to say, not yet seen what he was striving to see. All the other high things that interested his great equals, had for him no interest; one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> only he worshipped, the image of divine Beauty, and through this alone he wished to see Truth and by her to achieve spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and not so much freedom as completeness. And he saw her in three of her four forms, sensuous beauty, imaginative beauty, intellectual and ideal beauty. But it is the first only which he had entirely expressed when his thread was cut short in its beginning; the second he had carried far, but it was not yet fullorbed; towards the third and highest he was only striving, \"to philosophise he dared not yet\", but it was from the first the real sense and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of his genius.\n\nOn life he had like the others—Byron alone excepted—no hold; such work as *Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes*, in which he followed the romantic tendency of the time, was not<span class='page-number' id='s-145' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.145]</span> his own deeper self-expression; they are wonderful richly woven robes of sound and word and image curiously worked and brocaded, but they clothe nothing. The Odes, where fulfilment of imaginative beauty rises out of a higher sensuous seeking and satisfaction to an admirable sweetness, fullness, largeness and opulence and admits intimations of the ideal goddess, are almost all of them among the scanty number of the chief masterpieces in this high and deliberate lyrical form. But the real soul of Keats, his inner genius, the thing he was striving to bring out of himself is not to be altogether found even here; it lay in that attempt which, first failing in *Endymion*, was again resumed in *Hyperion*. It was the discovery of the divine Idea, Power and living norm of Beauty which by its breath of delight has created the universe, supports it and moves towards a greater perfection, inspires the harmonies of inward sight and outward form, yearns and strives towards the fullness of its own self-discovery by love and delight. Not yet in possession of his idea, he tries to find and to figure it in *Endymion* by sensuous images of a rich and dim moonlit dream with a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>allegory</span> or weft of symbols behind the words and thoughts, but his hand is still inexpert and fails in the execution. In *Hyperion* the idea is clearer and in bolder relief, but it is misconceived under a too intellectual, external and conventionally <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> Miltonic influence, and in his second version he turns not quite happily to a renewal of the form of his first attempt. He has found a clue in thought and imagination, but not quite its realisation in the spiritual idea, has already its imaginative, sensuous, something of its intellectual suggestion, but not yet what the spirit in him is trying to reveal, its mystically intellectual, mystically sensuous, mystically imaginative vision, form and word. The intimation of it in his work, his growing endeavour to find it and the unfulfilled promise of its discovery and unique fullness of expression are the innermost Keats and by it he belongs in spirit to these prophetic, but half-foiled singers of the dawn. He lives more than any other poet in the very temple of Beauty, traverses its sculptured and frescoed courts with a mind hued and shaped to her forms and colours and prepares, but is never permitted, to enter the innermost sanctuary.

Therefore Keats and Shelley were taken before their powers could fully expand, Byron led far out of the path, Blake isolated in his own splendour of remoteness, Coleridge and Wordsworth drawn away to lose the poet and seer in the mere intellectual mind. All wandered round their centre of inspiration, missed something needed and stopped or were stopped short.

There is much in this work to admire, something here and there to stimulate, but only a little that lifts off the feet and carries to the summits of the poetic enthusiasm.\n\nThe descent from the uncertain but high elevations of the first romantic, half spiritual outbreak is very marked, baffling and sudden.

There is a more steady working, but with it a clogged and heavier breath; a wealth of colour and nearer strain of thinking, but a lower flame of the spirit. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> is assured and careful enough in its workmanship but, less inspired, it has a paucity of greatness and a too temperate impulsion.\n\nThe intellectual preparation of the previous poetry, the depth and wealth of experience which must found the greatest and most successful audacities of spiritual vision, had been insufficient, coming as it did after a shallow and superficial age of the acute, but limited cult of Reason. The work of the middle nineteenth century was to prepare anew the intellectual ground and to lead up to a more conscious, enriched and careful artistic execution. But it was a tract of intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> in which there was much width of a kind and considerable invention, but a very insufficient height and profundity.

It is the most unlovely and uninspiring period of the English spirit. Never was the aesthetic sense so drowned in pretentious ugliness, seldom the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> crusted in such an armoured imperviousness to fine and subtle thinking, the ebb of spirituality so far out and low. It was a period of smug commercial middle-class prosperity, dull mechanism, hard utilitarianism and a shoddy liberalism bursting and running over with self-content in its narrow practical rationality, spiritual poverty and intellectual ineptitude. Unteachable, it bore with a scornful complacency or bewildered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span> or a listening ear of impervious indulgence the lightning shafts of Arnold's irony, the turbid fulminations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carlyle</span>, the fiery raids of Ruskin or saw unaffected others of its fine or great spirits turn for refuge to mediaevalism or socialistic utopias. The work of these forerunners was done in a wilderness of intellectual commonness and busy mediocre energy; it bore fruit afterwards, but only when the century was in its wane and other infant powers of the immenser <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> were beginning to raise their heads of cloud and light.\n\nBut this work of revolt and preparation was done chiefly in prose.

There is certainly much imaginative beauty, much artistic or fine or strong technical execution,—a great deal more in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of this element than at any previous time,—much excellent work high enough in the second rank, but the inner surge and satisfaction of a free or deep spirit, the strong high-riding pinion or the skyward look, these things are rare in Victorian poetry.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> of Tennyson, now a little dimmed and tarnished by the breath of Time, occupied this epoch with a great and immediate brilliance. He is unquestionably the representative English poet of his time. He mirrors its ordinary cultivated mind as it shaped in the English temperament and intelligence, with an extraordinary fidelity and in a richly furnished and heavily decorated mirror set round with all the art and device that could be appreciated by the contemporary taste. There has been no more consummate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the language, and this mastery is used with a careful, sure and unfailing hand. Whatever has to be expressed, whether it be of considerable, mediocre or no worth, is yet given a greater than its intrinsic value by a power of speech which without any such remarkable or astonishing energy as would excite or exalt the mind or disturb it from a safe acquiescence and a luxurious ease of reception, has always a sufficient felicity, curiously worked even when it affects simplicity, but with a chastened if not quite chaste curiosity. The turn of phrase almost always hits the mind with a certain, sometimes easy, sometimes elaborate poetic device. It turns always to find and does find the pictorial value of the thing to be described, and even, if such a phrase can be used, the pictorial value of the thought to be seized. There is a similar <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> of device and effect in the verse; if there are no great lyrical, odic or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> outbursts to sweep us out of ourselves, there is the same well-governed craft of effective turn and invention as in the language, the same peculiar manner of easily carried elaborateness, a leisurely but never sluggish self-considering self-adorning flow<span class='page-number' id='s-151' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.151]</span> which succeeds in being immediately received and accepted. The art with which the subject matter is dressed up is of the same kind; a restrained elaborateness, a curious picturesqueness of presentation, a taking, sometimes opulent and effective form. The refinement and felicity are not of a kind which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> for any unusual receptive power or aesthetic fineness to meet it and feel all its beauty; there is enough and to spare to attract the cultured, nothing to baffle or exceed the ordinary mind. This art is that of a master craftsman, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goldsmith</span>, silversmith, jeweller of speech and substance with much of the decorative painter in his turn, who never travels <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> general, well-understood and popular ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, but gives them by his fineness of manner and felicity of image a charm and distinction which belong more properly to rarer and greater or lovelier motives. The achievement is of a kind which would hardly be worth doing more than once, but done that once and with such mastery it takes its place and compels admiration. The spirit is not filled and satisfied, much less uplifted, but the outer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span> is caught and for a time held captive.\n\nBut it is doubtful whether the future will attach to Tennyson's poetry anything at all near to the value it assumed for the contemporary English mind. When we try to estimate the substance and see what it permanently gives or what new thing it discovers for the poetic vision, we find that there is extraordinarily little in the end. Tennyson wrote much narrative poetry, but he is not a great narrative poet. There is a curious blending of incompatible intentions in all his work of this kind and even his exceptional skill could not save him from a brilliant failure. He has on the one side a will to convey some high spiritual and ethical intention of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> through the imaginative use of tale and legend, and that could give a scope for a very noble kind of poetry, but he has not the power to lay a great hold on the ancient figures and recreate them to be symbols of a new significance. The *Idylls of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span>* miss both the romantic and the idyllic beauty and arrive only at a graceful decorated effective triviality. The grand old Celtic myths and traditions already strangely mediaevalised by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Malory</span>, but full still of life and large <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span><span class='page-number' id='s-152' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.152]</span> and colour are modernised into a baffling and disappointing superficiality and miss all greatness and power of life. There is no congruity between the form and symbol and the feeling and substance. They seem solely to be used to frame a conventional sentimentalism of Victorian domesticity and respectable social <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span>. But the wearing of the white and scentless flower of a blameless life in a correct button-hole and a tepid sinning without the least tinge of passion or conviction by decorated puppets who are too evidently lay-figures of very modern ladies and gentlemen disguised as knights and dames, was hardly a sufficient justification for evoking the magic figures of old legend and romance. The life so masqueraded misses reality and it does not arrive at any great compensating imaginative or interpretative representation; modernism and the affectation of mediaevalism, conventional reality and the falsetto tones of pseudo-romance destroy each other and produce a glittering incongruity. There is a void of the true sincerity of poetic vision at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the original conception and no amount of craft and skill in language or descriptive detail and picture can cure that original deficiency. The poet has no meditative, no emotional or impassioned, no close or revealing grasp on life, and on the other hand no deep interpretative idea, and without one or other of these things narrative poetry of the modern kind cannot succeed; it becomes a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> without soul or life-breath. Even when Tennyson confines himself to the poetic modern tale without these disguises or any motive but the ethically pointed telling, he arrives at the same result, a richly coloured triviality.\n\nThis principal work of his maturity fails; its popularity springs from its work of detail and its appeal to the superficial sentiment of the time: but some earlier work of the kind had a nobler success. In the *Morte d'Arthur* there is some natural magic and vision which if it had been sustained and kept the same delicate and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> strain, might have made the cycle of idylls a new poetic revelation. In other poems, in the *Lotos-Eaters, Ulysses, Oenone*, where set narrative is avoided and the legend is a starting-point or support for thought, vision and beauty, some fullness of these things is reached; but still<span class='page-number' id='s-153' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.153]</span> the form is greater than the substance which has no heights and only occasionally strikes depths. Tennyson does not figure largely as a lyrical poet in spite of one or two inspired and happy moments; for he has neither the lyrical passion and intoxication nor the profounder depth of lyrical feeling. In his description of Nature there is no greater seeing, but a painting of vivid details detached for simile and ornament, and though he worked up a great accuracy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> and colour, the deeper sincerity of the born Nature-poets is absent. Finally he gives us a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> deal of thinking of a kind in often admirably telling phrase and with much art of setting, but he is not a revealing poetical thinker. His thought seldom escapes from the conventional limits of a cultivated, but not a large or original Victorian mind; it beautifies most often the obvious and commonplace or the current and acceptable ideas; with rare exceptions he has neither exaltations nor profundities nor subtleties nor surprises. A great poetical craftsman turning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> forms to account for the displaying of an unusual power of descriptive and decorative language and a verse of most skilled device, but no very great purpose and substance, this he is from beginning to end of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>. His art suffers from the excess of value of form over value of content; it incurs a liability to a besetting note of artificiality, a frequent falsetto tone of prettiness, an excessive stress, a colouring which is often too bright for the stuff it hues and is unevenly laid, but it is always taking and effective. By his very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> of mind he becomes the representative poet of a certain side of the English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, not in its originality and adventurous power, but in its temperate convention and fixity, renders its liberalism and its conservatism, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and dislike of idealism, its surface common sense of doubt and traditional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>, its successful way of dealing with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>, its formal ethicism and its absence of passion. But to all these things he brings an artistic decorative quality which is new in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>. He has left his stamp on the language and has given starting-points and forms for poets of a rarer force to turn to greater uses and pass beyond them to a new construction.\n\nTennyson is the most representative and successful poet of<span class='page-number' id='s-154' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.154]</span> the Victorian epoch. Others who have not the same limitations, either fall below him in art or have a less sustained and considerable bulk and variety of work. Swinburne brings in into the poetry of the time <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> to which the rest are strangers. He has a fire and passion and vehemence of song which is foreign to their temperament. He brings in too the continental note of denial, atheistic affirmation, sceptical revolt, passionate political idealism, but to these things he gives the Anglo-Celtic aggressiveness and violence, not the Latin sureness and clarity. He is a great lyrist, but like many of his contemporaries revels too much in device and virtuosities of form and his lyrical thought and sentiment turn easily to the dithyrambic note, are marred by excess, diffuseness, an inequality in the inspiration and the height and tone. But he has especially in his earlier poetry done work of a perfect and highly wrought beauty, a marvellous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>. There is often a captivatingly rich and sensuous appeal in his language and not unoften it rises to a splendid magnificence. *Atalanta in Calydon, Dolores, Hertha, The Garden of Proserpine* and numerous other poems with the same perfect workmanship will always stand among the consummate achievements of English poetry. He is at his best one of the great lyrical singers; he writes in a flood and sweep and passion of melody: he is unique as a voice of all-round revolt, political, moral and of every kind, and in this lies his main significance. But he exhausts himself too soon; the reproach of emptiness can be brought against much of his work and his later voice becomes empty of significance but not of resonance. The quieter classical power of Arnold which voices the less confident search of a self-doubting scepticism, has lucidity, balance and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span>, a fine though restricted and tenuous strain of thought and a deep and penetrating melancholy, the mediaevalism and aesthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span> of Rossetti, the slow dreamy narrative of Morris which takes us to a refuge from the blatancy and ugliness of the Victorian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> into the gracious world of old story and legend, bring in each their own significance for the age and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> towards that enrichment of the language of thought and artistic poetical feeling which is the chief work of this intervening time. They have all three this<span class='page-number' id='s-155' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.155]</span> characteristic that they are studious artists,—it is significant that two of them are painters and decorative craftsmen,—who are concerned to give beauty and finish to the material of poetry rather than original poets with a large power of inspiration. Their range is small, but they have brought into English poetry a turn for fine execution which is likely to be a long-abiding influence.\n\nAmong the Victorians Browning stands next to Tennyson in the importance of his poetic work and station as a representative figure of the age and creator. He surpasses him indeed in the mass and force and abundant variety of his work and the protean energy of his genius. His inventiveness of form and range and variety of subject are prodigious; he turns to every quarter of the world, seizes on every human situation, seems to be trying to exhaust a study of all possible human personalities and minds and characters and turn his eye on every age and period of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> and many countries and all possible scenes and extract from them their meaning and their interest for the satisfaction of his universal curiosity and his living and inexhaustible interest in the vividness and abundance of the life of earth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>. He has an equal interest in the human mind and its turns of thinking of all kinds and its human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>, ambitions, seekings and wants to pursue it everywhere in its ramifications, in its starts of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, peaks, windings, even all manner of borrowings of thought and feeling, nothing human is foreign to his research and pursuit, all enters into this prodigious embrace. This gives to his poetry a range and unceasing interest and richness of attraction which surpasses immeasurably all that his contemporaries can give us in wideness of the call of life, even though in them the poetic height to which they draw us may be greater than his. In his mass of creation he can be regarded as the most remarkable in invention and wideness, if not the most significant builder and narrator of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> of human life in his time.\n\nBrowning stands apart also from the other contemporary poets in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and personality of his work. He is in many ways the very opposite of them all. He is the one robust and masculine voice among these artists, sceptics, idealists or<span class='page-number' id='s-156' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.156]</span> dreamers, always original, vigorous, inexhaustible; with a great range of interests, a buoyant hold on life, a strong and clear eye, an assured belief and hope but no traditional conventionality, he alone adequately represents the curious, critical, eager, exploring mind of the age. He has depth and force and abundance of a certain kind of thought, which if not of the very first greatness and originality, is open to all manner of questioning and speculation and new idea. His regard ranges over history and delights in its pictures of the stir and energy of life and its changing scenes, over man and his thought and character and emotion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, looks into every cranny, follows every tortuous winding, seizes on each leap and start of the human machine. He is a student, critic, psychologist, thinker. He seeks to interpret, like certain French poets, the civilisations and the ages. His genius is essentially dramatic; for though he has written in many lyrical forms, the lyric is used to represent a moment in the drama of life or character, and though he uses the narrative, his treatment of it is dramatic and not narrative, as when he takes an Italian *fait-divers* and makes each personage relate or discuss it in such a way as to reveal his own motive, character, thought and passion. He does not succeed except perhaps once as a dramatist in the received forms because he is too analytic, too much interested in the mechanism of temperament, character, emotion and changing idea to concentrate sufficiently on their results in action; but he has an unrivalled force in seizing on a moment of the soul or mind and in following its convolutions as they start into dramatic thought, feeling and impulse. He of all these writers has hold of the substance of the work marked out for a poet of the age. And with all these gifts we might have had in him the great interpretative poet, one might almost say, the Shakespeare of his time. But by the singular fatality which so often pursues the English poetical genius, the one gift needed to complete him was denied. Power was there and the hold of his material; what was absent was the essential faculty of artistic form and poetic beauty, so eminent in his contemporaries, a fatal deficiency. This great creator was no artist; this strength was too robust and direct to give forth sweetness. There was no lack of<span class='page-number' id='s-157' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.157]</span> a certain kind of skill. If not an artist in verse, Browning is a consummate technician, one might almost say a mechanician in verse; his very roughnesses and crudities and contortions have the appearance of device and calculation. He had an immense command of language and was never at a lack for forcible and efficient expression, but in its base though not in all its turns it was the language of a vigorous and vivid and colourful prosaist rather than of a poet, of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and not the imagination. He could throw into it strong hues of the imagination, has sometimes though too seldom a vigorous richness and strong grace, achieves often a lyric elevation, but they supervene upon this base and do not ordinarily suffuse and change it or elevate it to a high customary level. Much strong and forceful work he did of a great and robust substance, won many victories, but the supreme greatness cannot come in poetry without the supreme beauty.\n\nArnold is a third considerable Victorian poet of the epoch, though he bulks less than the two more abundant writers who have till now held the first place. But as time goes on his figure emerges and assumes in quality though not in mass of work a first importance. His poetic work and quality may even be regarded as finer in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of poetic value if more tenuous in show of power than that of his two contemporaries. There is a return to the true classic style of poetry in the simplicity and straightforward directness of his diction and turn of thought that brings us back to the way of the earlier poets and gives a certain seriousness and power which we do not find in the over-consciousness and the too studied simplicity or elaborate carefulness and purposeful artistry of the other poets of the time. This imparts a note of depth and sincerity to his passion and his pathos, a character of high seriousness to his reflection and meditative thought, a greatness and strength to his moments of height and elevated force which raise him above the ordinary levels around him and create an impression of the truest poetry, the most genuine in poetic value, if not in effect the greatest of this Victorian age. His simplicity is a true thing and not the overstudied false simplicity of Tennyson; his thought is free from<span class='page-number' id='s-158' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.158]</span> the conventionality and platitude which constantly meets us in Tennyson's thinking; he can achieve the strongest effects, even the romantic effect without the overwrought romantic colour of Rossetti, Swinburne's overpitch or Tennyson's too frequent overcharge and decorative preciosity of expression. We are at ease with him and can be sure that he will not say too much but just what the true poet in him has to say and no more. For this reason he was able to bring into Victorian poetry the expression of the most characteristic trains of thought expressing the contemporary mind and temperament at its highest and best. Tennyson voices the conventional English mind, Swinburne a high-pitched cry of revolt or a revolutionary passion for freedom or even for licence; Rossetti and Morris take refuge in mediaevalism as they saw it: Arnold strikes out the more serious notes of contemporary thinking. He fails however to look beyond to the future. In one respect of literary workmanship he does however anticipate future trends; for he makes a departure towards certain tendencies of modernist forms of verse. He made the first attempt at any regular free verse and thus anticipated the modernist departure from metrical forms. He attempted also an imitation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> dramatic form but not with Swinburne's originality and the success achieved in *Atalanta in Calydon*.\n\nThis is the balance of the Victorian epoch; a considerable intellectual and artistic endeavour, contradicting, overcoming but still hampered by an ungenial atmosphere; two remarkable poets held back from the first greatness, one by imperfection of form, the other by imperfection of substance; four artists of less range, but with work of an accomplished, but overpitched or thin or languorous beauty; an enrichment and strengthening of the language which makes it more capable of fine and varied and curious thought, and the creation of an artistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span> which may impose in the future a check on the impulse of an overabundant energy to imperfection of eager haste and vagary in execution. If the promise of the coming age is fulfilled, it may be remembered as a fine, if limited period of preparation for the discovery of new, more beautiful and grander fields of poetry.<span class='page-number' id='s-159' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.159]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-victorian-poets","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Recent English Poetry - I","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-i","prvt":"The Poets of the Dawn - III","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-poets-of-the-dawn-iii","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["recent-english-poetry-i"],"t":"Recent English Poetry - I","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> away from the Victorian type in recent and contemporary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry cannot be said to have yet determined its final orientation.

There are experiments of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> kinds in language and rhythm and subject and treatment, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> notable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> each with his special turn and personality, but no supreme decisive speech and no gathering up of the many threads into a great representative work. The whole of European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> at the present time is of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>; it is a fluid mass with a hundred conflicting tendencies, a multitude of experiments, many minor <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span>, which has not yet run into any clear universal mould. All that can be done is to distinguish some common characteristics of an indicative value which emerge in the more significant work and have touched more or less the performance of the lesser writers. Here we can get at least at a certain persistent element, certain potential issues.\n\nThe thing that strikes at once in a general view is that it is a period of transition, not yet a new age, but the preparation for a new age of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. Everywhere there is a seeking after some new thing, a discontent with the moulds, ideas and powers of the past, a spirit of innovation, a desire to get at deeper powers<span class='page-number' id='s-160' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.160]</span> of language, rhythm, form, because a subtler and vaster <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> is in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, there are deeper and more significant things to be said than have yet been spoken, and poetry, the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of speech, must find a fitting voice for them. The claim of tradition is still strong, but even those who keep most in the old ways, are impelled to fill in their lines with more searching things of a more compelling substance, to strike from their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> sounds, variations, meanings for which it had not before the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>. The attempt has not yet been supremely successful in its whole purpose, in spite of some poetic achievement of considerable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, originality and compass, but it has liberated at least with some initial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> novel powers and opened fresh paths; a few bright streams of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> meet the eye running to form some mighty Brahmaputra or Ganges which is not yet in sight, though we get here and there a blue Yamuna or white Saraswati or some large impetuous torrent making its way through open plain or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> woodland towards the great unseen confluence. There are many widely separate attempts, some fine or powerful beginnings, as yet no large consummation.\n\nThe straining for a new power of rhythm is the first indication of the coming change. Not quite so marked, not by any means so successful as the change in the type and power of poetical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, it is still indicative; rhythm is the subtle soul of poetry and a change in the spirit of the rhythm must come if this change in the spirit of the poetry is fully to discover itself and altogether realise its own characteristic greatness and perfection. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mankind</span> is moving to another spirit in its thought and life founded on another and deeper and larger truth of its inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> than it has yet in the mass been able to see, hold and put into form of living. This change must find its echo and interpretation or even some of its power of revelation and initiation in poetry, and poetry to express this greater spirit must find out a deeper, larger, more flexible, or, if <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> may say so, more multitudinously expressive rhythm than the great poets of the past were under the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of using; something of the same change has to be achieved as has been successfully accomplished in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>. We see accordingly some attempt to break or enlarge,<span class='page-number' id='s-161' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.161]</span> deepen or subtilise the traditional moulds, to substitute others of a more delicate character or with a more varied and flexible principle, to search out new packed or dissolved movements. There have been some considerable successes, but nothing of such a complete, sweeping and satisfying force as would quite content a certain eagerness and impatient urge of the arriving age to find a full rhythmic basis for its own way of self-expression. And so we find too the attempt to initiate a violent and unprecedented revolution in the whole fundamental method of poetic rhythm.\n\nThis tendency in some writers goes no farther than an irregular use of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> which does not really carry us any farther towards the desired result and is in no way an improvement on the past since it has no true artistic principle to guide us to freer and more consummate harmonies. But pushed to its logical issue it has created the still growing form of free verse of which we now find examples in most of the great literary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> and coupled with it a theory that this is the one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> for poetry. Metre and rhyme are said to be played out, things of the past, which can no longer be allowed to chain and hamper the great and free movement which the enlarging spirit of poetry demands; as rhyme was in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>'s later view only a dainty trifle which he flung aside for the organ harmonies of his blank verse, so metre itself is a petty thing, half ornament, half fetter, which has to be flung aside for some nobly self-governed democratic anarchy that is to develop from this new type. That is a theory of very doubtful validity. In the hands of most of its exponents it seems to be in practice nothing but a licence for writing prose in variously cut lengths, prose breaking off at the end of a clause or in the middle of it to go on refreshed in the line below,—I have seen even a line of free verse consisting of a majestic solitary pronoun,—and that is more an eccentric method of printing than a new rhythm. But without accepting the theory in its intolerant entirety one can appreciate the motive which moved the greater masters and more skilful craftsmen of this form, if form it can be called, to make the innovation. There is something large and many-sided and constantly mutable in the life, thought and spirit of today which needs, to express it<span class='page-number' id='s-162' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.162]</span> sympathetically, vast and flowing movements or on the contrary brief, sudden and abrupt paces or the alternation of these and intermediate and variant lengths and turns: there is something at the same time densely full and singularly and minutely subtle in the modern thinking mind which is with difficulty accommodable by the restricted range of subtleties, variations and fullnesses of any given poetic measure. Why not then break away from all the old hampering restrictions and find a new principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> in accordance with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, the breadth and largeness of view, the fineness of feeling and sensation of the modern spirit, some form which shall have the liberty of prose and yet command the intensified heights and fluctuations and falls of the cadence of poetry? There is no reason why not, if the thing can be done,—the proof of these things lies in the execution; but it may be doubted whether the method used is the right method. At any rate it has not been fully justified even in the hands of its greatest or most skilful exponents. It is used, as in Whitman, to give the roll of the sea of life or the broad and varying movements of the spirit of humanity in its vigorous experience and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, or, as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span>, to arrive at the free and harmonious accession of the human intelligence to profound, large and powerful truths of the spirit, or, as in certain French writers, to mould into accurate rhythm the very substance and soul and characteristic movement of soul-states, ideas or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> described and seen. These are things that need to be done, but it remains to be seen whether they cannot be done in the recognised and characteristic movement of poetry, rather than in a compromise with prose cadences. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of poetic measure walking in the path opened by the ancient discovery of cadenced beat and concentrated rhythm has not yet exhausted itself, nor is there any proof that it cannot accommodate its power to new needs or any sign that it can only survive in an arrested senility or fall into a refined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span>.\n\nThe most considerable representatives of this new and free form of poetic rhythm are English and American, Carpenter and Whitman. Tagore's translations of his lyrics have come in as a powerful adventitious aid, but are not really to the point<span class='page-number' id='s-163' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.163]</span> in the question at issue; for these translations are nothing but a rhythmically poetic prose and that kind of writing, cadenced prose poetry, a well recognised form, cannot and does not try to compete with the established principle of measure; it is an indulgence, a minor variation which has yet its definite place and serves certain purposes which could not otherwise be fulfilled with any adequacy. It is perhaps the only method for the work Tagore intended, a poetic translation of poetry reproductive of the exact thought and spiritual intention of the original; for a version in the fixed measures of another language not only substitutes another mould for the original movement, but by the substitution gives it almost another soul, so powerful, distinct and creative a thing is poetic rhythm; but the more flexible, less insistent cadence of poetic prose does not so seize on and recast the spirit of the original movement; it may even give a far-off minimised shadow, echo, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of it, if the same or a similar spirit is at work: it can never have the same power, but it may have some echo of a similar suggestion. When for instance Tagore writes in English,—\n\n>Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and thou callest thy\nsevered self in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> in me. The great pageant of thee and me has overspread\nthe sky. With the tune of thee and me all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> is vibrant, and\nall ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.—\n\nwe have a very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> delicately cadenced poetic prose and nothing more. Tagore is what some of the French writers of *vers libre* are and Whitman and Carpenter are not, a delicate and subtle craftsman, and he has done his work with a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> and spiritual fineness; but there is no attempt to do anything more than the just work in hand, no intention of displacing the old way of poetry in which he has done in his own language such wonderful things, by a new principle of poetic movement. If there were any such intention, it would have to be pronounced a failure. One has only to compare this English prose, beautiful as it is, with the original poetry to see how much has gone out with the change; something is successfully substituted which<span class='page-number' id='s-164' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.164]</span> may satisfy the English reader, but can never satisfy the ear or the mind that has once listened to the singer's own native and magical melodies. And this is so even though the intellectual substance, the intellectual precision and distinctness of the thought are often more effective, carry home more quickly in the translation, because in the original the intellectual element, the thought limits are being constantly overborne and are sometimes almost swallowed up by the waves of suggestion that come stealing in with the music: so much more is heard than is said that the soul listening goes floating into that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> and counts the definite contribution of the intelligence as of a lesser value. Precisely there lies the greatest power of poetic rhythm for the very highest work that the new age has to do, and that it can be done by a new use of the poetic method without breaking the whole form of poetry, Tagore's own lyrical work[^1] in his mother tongue is the best evidence.\n\n[^1]: This cannot quite be said or not in the same degree about other work of Tagore's where this great lyrist is not so much himself in his movement, though he is always a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of rhythm.\n\nWhitman's aim is consciently, clearly, professedly to make a great revolution in the whole method of poetry, and if anybody could have succeeded, it ought to have been this giant of poetic thought with his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of diction, this spiritual crowned athlete and vital prophet of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span>, liberty and the soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and Nature and all humanity. He is a great poet, one of the greatest in the power of his substance, the energy of his vision, the force of his style, the largeness at once of his personality and his universality. His is the most Homeric voice since <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span>, in spite of the modern's ruder less elevated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthesis</span> of speech and the difference between that limited Olympian and this broad-souled Titan, in this that he has the nearness to something elemental which makes everything he says, even the most common and prosaic, sound out with a ring of greatness, gives a force even to his barest or heaviest phrases, throws even upon the coarsest, dullest, most physical things something of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span>; and he has the elemental Homeric power of sufficient straightforward<span class='page-number' id='s-165' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.165]</span> speech, the rush too of oceanic sound though it is here the surging of the Atlantic between continents, not the magic roll and wash of the Aegean around the isles of Greece. What he has not, is the unfailing poetic beauty and nobility which saves greatness from its defects—that supreme gift of Homer and Valmiki—and the self-restraint and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> law which makes even the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> more divine. Whitman will remain great after all the objections that can be made against his method or his use of it, but the question is whether what served his unique personality, can be made a rule for lesser or different spirits, and whether the defects which we see but do not and cannot weigh too closely in him, will not be fatal when not saved by his all-uplifting largeness. A giant can pile up Pelion and Ossa and make of it an unhewn chaotic stair to Olympus, but others would be better and more safely employed in cutting steps of marble or raising by music a ladder of sapphires and rubies to their higher or their middle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span>. Personality, force, temperament can do unusual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span>, but the miracle cannot always be turned into a method or a standard.\n\nWhitman's verse, if it can be so called, is not simply a cadenced prose, though quite a multitude of his lines only just rise above the prose rhythm. The difference is that there is a constant will to intensify the fall of the movement so that instead of the unobtrusive ictus of prose, we have a fall of the tread, almost a beat, and sometimes a real beat, a meeting and parting, sometimes a deliberate clash or even crowding together of stresses which recall the spirit of the poetical movement, though they obey no recognised structural law of repetitions and variations. In this kind of rhythm we find actually three different levels—the distinction may be a little rough, but it will serve,—a gradation which is very instructive. First we have a movement which just manages to be other than prose movement, but yet is full of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of a certain kind of prose rhythm. Here the first defect is that the ear is sometimes irritated, sometimes disappointed and baulked by a divided demand, memory or expectation, hears always the prose suggestion behind pursuing and dragging down the feet of the poetic enthusiasm. It is as if<span class='page-number' id='s-166' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.166]</span> one were watching the \"aerial walk\" of a Hathayogin who had just conquered the force of gravitation, but only to the extent of a few inches, so that one is always expecting the moment which will bring him down with a bump to mother earth. It is something like a skimming just above the ground of prose, sometimes a dragging of the feet with a frequent touch and upkicking of the dust, for inevitably the poetic diction and imaginative power of style fall to the same level. Much of Whitman's work is in this manner; he carries it off by the largeness and sea-like roll of the total impression, but others have not the same success,—even the French craftsmen are weighed down,—and in them the whole has a draggled and painful effect of an amphibious waddling incertitude. But there is a nobler level at which he often keeps which does not get out of sight of the prose plain or lift up above all its gravitation, but still has a certain poetic power, greatness and nobility of movement. But it is still below what an equal force would have given in the master measures of poetry.\n\nBut the possibilities of an instrument have to be judged by its greatest effects, and there are poems, lines, passages in which Whitman strikes out a harmony which has no kinship to nor any memory of the prose gravitation, but is as far above it as anything done in the great metrical cadences. And here, and not only in Whitman, but in all writers in this form who rise to that height, we find that consciously or unconsciously they arrive at the same secret principle, and that is the essential principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> choric and dithyrambic poetry turned to the law of a language which has not the strong resource of quantity. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arnold</span> deliberately attempted such an adaptation but, in spite of beautiful passages, with scant success; still when he writes such a line as\n\n>The too vast orb of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span>,\n\nit is this choric movement that he reproduces. Whitman's first poem in *Sea-Drift* and a number of others are written partly or throughout in this manner. When he gives us the dactylic and spondaic harmony of his lines,<span class='page-number' id='s-167' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.167]</span>\n\n>Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,\nOut of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,\nOut of the ninth-month midnight,\n\none of them wanting only one foot to be a very perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span> or the subtly varied movement of this other passage,\n\n>Over the hoarse surging of the sea,\nOr flitting from brier to brier by day,\nI saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,\nThe solitary guest from Alabama,\n\none has almost the rhythmical illusion of listening to a Sophoclean or Aeschylean chorus. In the opening stanzas of the noble *Prayer of Columbus*, there is a continuous iambic metrical stress, but with the choric movement. One finds the same thing sometimes in French *vers libre*,—one poem at least of the kind I have seen of wonderful beauty,—though the success is not so easy in that language. Tagore has recently attempted a kind of free verse in Bengali, not so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> as his regular metres, though melodious enough, as everything must be that is written by this master musician of the word, and throughout there is the same choric or dithyrambic principle of movement. This then seems to be the natural high-water mark of free poetical rhythm; it is a use of the poetic principle of measure in its essence without the limitations of a set form. Evidently much can be done in this rhythmical method. But it is yet doubtful whether in languages which lack the support of quantitative measure, poetical expression in this form can carry home with at all the same force as in the received ways of word-music.\n\nWe may get some idea of the limitations of the form by one or two examples from the poetry of Carpenter I find quoted by Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cousins</span> in his essay. Carpenter with a poetic faculty of a high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, a prophet of democracy and of the Self, like Whitman, but of a higher more spiritual truth of the Self, has like him found it impossible to restrain the largeness of his vision and personality in the bonds of metrical poetry. In both we see that the prophet and thinker predominate over the poet and artist. Less rough and<span class='page-number' id='s-168' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.168]</span> great than the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> voice from the other side of the ocean, his poetry has a more harmonious, limpid and meditative fullness. But the lesser abundance of force and drive makes us feel more the limitations of his form. The thought is not only great, but poetically great and satisfying, the expression as form of thought is noble and admirable, but we miss the subtler rhythmic uplift of the poetic enthusiasm which is given to minds of much less power by the inspiring cadence and the ordered measures of the poetic spirit, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chandas</span>*. His flow is ordinarily of the middle kind with occasional choric turns and movements, but the latter do not carry with them the full force of the intenser poetic cadence. To cite one passage,—\n\n>There in the region of equality in the world of Freedom no longer limited, standing on a lofty peak in heaven above the clouds,\n\n>From below hidden. Yet to all who pass into that region most clearly visible\n\n>He the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> appeared.\n\nWhitman would have broken that up into five lines and got by it a more distinct and forcible effect,—for the breath of poetry best rises and falls in brief and intense lengths; so printed, it would be at once apparent that we have a varied choric movement, a little stumbling into half-prose just before the end, but otherwise admirable, with two sudden turns of great poetic force, where the movement is precisely that of the Greek chorus. But the total effect is the sense of what one might almost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a noble and chanting superprose rhythm.\n\nThis appears more clearly in another passage where Carpenter's movement is more at its normal level. He begins with a strain which is only just distinguishable from the prose strain, but suddenly rises from it to the beginning of a choric elevation,\n\n>As one shuts a door after a long confinement in the house—so out of your own plans and purposes escaping,—\n\nthen comes the full choric rise,<span class='page-number' id='s-169' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.169]</span>\n\n>Out of the mirror-lined chambers of self (grand though they be, but O how dreary!) in which you have hitherto spent your life,—\n\nwhere, if the line had only ended with the parenthesis, it would have been a strain of perfect choric poetry, magnificently thought, imaged and cadenced, but the closing words spoil the effect, for they are a sharp descent towards the prose level. There are too elevations rising up from a rhythmical prose cadence but lifted high by the scriptural nobility of phrase and spiritual turn which we get so often in Carpenter. These fluctuations appear then to be inherent in the form and it seems to me that being in their nature a constant fall from the striving after a sustained perfection, they take away altogether from the claims of this \"free verse\". In lesser writers there is a similar but much more pronounced inadequacy; they rise little and fall or drag along with the most easily satisfied self-content in lowness. But that poets of great power should be satisfied with these deficiencies of their instrument and their most cultured readers accept them without question, indicates an inferiority, almost a depravation in the modern ear, or at least a great remissness in the austerity of the search after perfection. It is now sometimes said that the lines of poetry should follow the lines of life, and life, it might be contended, is of this kind, thought itself is of this kind, and the rhythm of poetry gains in sincerity by following them. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> is not of this kind, the poetic spirit is not of this kind; the nature of art is to strive after a nobler beauty and more sustained perfection than life can give, the nature of poetry is to soar on the wings of the inspiration to the highest intensities and keep winging, as far as may be, always near to them. A form which in the name of freedom remits and relaxes this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, whatever its other merits and advantages, means a laxity of effort and is a dangerous downward concession.\n\nBut there is another objection which may be denied, but seems to me true, that this kind of verse does not give its full spiritual value to the poet's speech. Carpenter has a power of substance, thought-vision, image, expression which is very rare<span class='page-number' id='s-170' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.170]</span> and in all these respects he would have been recognised as not only equal but superior to many who have enjoyed in their own day the reputation of poets of the first rank. That he is not so recognised is due to the inferior form, a form legitimate enough for lesser uses, but not easily capable of the greatest poetic effects. Whitman too for all his energy loses in this way; even his greatest things do not go absolutely and immediately home, or having entered they do not so easily seize on the soul, take possession and rest in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, yet vibrating mastery. The real poetic cadence has that power, and to make the full use of it is the sign of the greatest masters; it has in it then something magical, immediate and miraculous, an unanalysable triumph of the spirit. But this other movement has not that stamp, it does only a little more than a highly concentrated prose might do, and this is because of the three indispensable intensities of poetry it may have intensity of thought and soul-substance, intensity of expression, but the intensity of rhythm, which is poetry's primal need, is lowered and diluted,—even, one feels, to a certain extent in its choric movements: by that lowering the two other intensities suffer, the poet himself tends to loosen them to the level of his movement. If that is so, those who use the form to meet the demands of the new age, are on the wrong track. But a demand is there and it indicates a real need. It is evident that Whitman and Carpenter could not have expressed themselves altogether in the existing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, even if they had made the attempt. But if the new age is to express itself with the highest poetical power, it must be by new discoveries within the principle of the intenser poetical rhythm. The recent or living masters may not have done this, though we may claim that some beginnings have been made, but the new age is only at its commencement; the decisive departures, the unforeseen creations may yet be due which will equip it with an instrument or many instruments suited to the largeness, depth and subtlety of the coming spirit.<span class='page-number' id='s-171' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.171]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-i","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Recent English Poetry - II","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-ii","prvt":"The Victorian Poets","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-victorian-poets","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["recent-english-poetry-ii"],"t":"Recent English Poetry - II","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The effective stream of poetry in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> tongue has followed no such strong distinctive turn as would be able to sweep the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> along with it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> mastering direction.

But we find it elsewhere too in obscurer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>; on this element we may pause to lay stress while we leave aside as of less importance the crowding variety of other temperamental and personal emphasis which hides it from view or chokes up its channels of emergence.

I may take for my purpose four of them whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> stand behind or are still with us and their station already among those whose work endures, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Meredith</span> and Phillips among recent English poets, A. E. and Yeats of the Irish singers.[^1] There is a very great difference of the degree and power with which the spirit has opened to them its secret and a great difference too in the turn which they give to its promptings. The two English poets have it at moments in a high clarity, but at others it is only a suggestion behind which gives a penetrating, original and profound tone to their work. This is their native secret when they go deepest into themselves, a thing they get sometimes into clear speech perhaps by right of their Celtic inheritance; but they work in the English tradition, follow other attractions, bear the burden of a tendency of aesthetic feeling, form and treatment which lead away from the pursuit of the direct seeking and the perfect manner. The consistent note we get more constantly in the Irish poets who, freer in mind from<span class='page-number' id='s-173' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.173]</span> this past tradition, though something of it must cling perhaps to all who write in the English tongue, unless they start with the superb revolutionary defiance of Whitman,—are able to strike out with a less encumbered gait into new paths of thought and movement. They have too an original well of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> in the Celtic spirit, temperament and tradition from which they draw a magical and delicate draught of other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> naturally stimulative of a subtler and more spiritual vision: they escape, and that is another supreme advantage, from the overstress of the intellectual and vital notes which in their English kindred and compeers take from the direct purity of utterance of their spirit. None of them has indeed the large and puissant voice of Whitman or his dominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of poetic personality, though they have what he has not or did not care to evolve, the artistic faculty and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>, but each has a high peculiar power in his own way of light, is at his best, and the best is not infrequent even in the least of them, a poet of the first rank. The greatness of scope and unified plenitude of power is absent which would have been needed to make any one of them a grand representative voice of the time. But they lead and prepare, they strike great new notes, open or at least give hints of great new ways for a future poetry.\n\n[^1]: I take most of my citations from Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cousins</span>' book, the only source I have at present before me; but though few, they are made from the same standpoint and selected with singular felicity and serve fully my purpose.\n\nOne thing that comes home to us when we take a comparative view of this poetry, when we look at the inmost strands of the expression at which it arrives in these four poets, all of them among its boldest and most original and therefore most revealing representatives, is a certain common element behind their differences; this we find in a novel use of rhythmic movement, a sudden new moving force, turn, stamp and fashion in the minting of the gold and silver of their language and as the secret of this departure a quite other innate or conscious aim, not always manifest in the visible form of the substance, though that too is there in plenty, but in the way of seeing the object on which the inner eye is turned, whether it be idea, thing or person, significant emotion or glint of soul-power in man or revealing object or suggestive hint in Nature. This aim we may perhaps best express if we take up and modify a phrase of Meredith's when<span class='page-number' id='s-174' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.174]</span> he speaks of the hampered human voice that could never say\n\n>Our inmost in the sweetest way—\n\nhampered by the austerity of its wisdom or the excess of its sense and passion. But if it is rarely that this sweetest way is found—yet do we not get near to it sometimes in Yeats and Tagore?—at least this new turn of the poetic voice is characteristically an endeavour to see and to say our inmost in the inmost way.\n\nThe natural turn of poetry, that which gives to it its soul of superiority to other ways of human utterance, is the endeavour of the interpretative cast of its mind always to look <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the object, even to get behind it and evoke from a something that was waiting for us within its own inevitable speech and rhythm. That inwardness is the triumph of great poetical speech, whether the poet has his eye like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> on physical object and power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and the externalised thought and emotion which they throw up into the surface roll of life, or else like Shakespeare on the surge of the life-spirit and its forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and passion and its waves of self-interpreting thought and reflection, or on the play of the detached or half-detached seeing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> or the inspired reason, or on the strainings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> of man striving to find the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of things in the thousand-coloured threads of the double web of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. The manner and yield of poetry vary according to the depth we penetrate into that inner something which is hidden by layer upon layer of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> an intervening medium, but which offers and gives itself wonderfully in all of them, yet seems to retreat always and invites to a profounder pursuit and discovery; it varies according to the insistence of the eye on the object or its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> into the greater significance of which the object is only the seizable symbol, or according as we are stopped by the medium or break through it to some truth of the one thing in all which throws out in these various sheaths such different richnesses of form, colour and suggestion of idea and sound, but is yet one in all things to the soul that can discover its eternal unity.\n\nBut this new way of seeing is a first effort to get through the object and the medium and employ them only as suggestive<span class='page-number' id='s-175' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.175]</span> instruments, to break beyond the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> and the emotion, the imagination and the idea, not to be stopped by these things, though using the inmost life-stress, the inmost releasing force of the emotion, the inmost plunge of the imagination or its most searching power of form, colour and symbol, the inmost penetrating subtlety of the idea and to arrive at what we may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the soul-sense, the soul-sound and as far as may be the soulword interpretative of some yet deeper revealing truth in all their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>. There is in most recent poetry that counts, though less here, more there, some element of this kind of straining, force, pressure on sound and word and vision, and though it often turns into strange, obscure and devious paths, obstructed by the insistence of the superficial desire-soul or weighted by the intellect,—the two powers in us which modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> has developed into an exaggerated predominance,—still it reaches out towards this effort to see our inmost in the inmost way, and when it gets free, delivers voices of a supreme power, vision and purity. And what it must lead to in the end if it gets to its end, does not stop short or turn aside after some other lure, must be some direct seeing by the soul of the soul or self everywhere in its own delivered force of vision,—the direct vision of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, *ātmani ātmānam ātmanā*,—not the sensuous or the imaginative or the intellectual or the vital insistence, but a greater Potency using and surmounting them, the Soul's own delivered self-vision in all things and delight of its own greatness and light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. That is the turn of mind which is now making itself heard in effort, though not in full mastery, stammered here, there sung with a slight, delicate and subtle sweetness or with an initial load of rare or crowding suggestion, but waiting still the splendour of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> song that shall rise into the light of the spirit,—\n\n>So pure that it salutes the suns,\nThe voice of one for millions,\nIn whom the millions rejoice\nFor <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> their one spirit voice.<span class='page-number' id='s-176' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.176]</span>\n\nThe inmost seeing must bring out of itself to be poetically effective the inmost word and sound, must find out a luminous purity of its steps or a profound depth of its movement, must be said in the inmost way. Rhythm is the most potent, founding element of poetic expression, and though most modern poets depend or at least lean more heavily on force of thought and substance than on the greater musical suggestions of rhythm,—Shelley, Swinburne, Yeats are exceptions,—there must always be a change in this basis of the poet's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> when there is a substantial change of the constituting spirit and motive. Especially when there is this more subtle spiritual aim, the rhythmical movement becomes of a new importance. Whether as an aid to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> out by the subtle meaning of the cadence the total spiritual suggestion of the speech or, more supremely, to bring in out of the depths, as great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> does, some surge or outwelling of the infinite movement and cry of the spirit and bear like a jewel of light on its breast the outbreak of the inevitable revealing word, it must be persuaded to find some new unity of measure and speech, the thought echoing with the very native sound of its Idea. We find accordingly the beginning, sometimes something more, of another spirit in the movement of this poetry. These poets use for the most part old established metrical forms or variations of them; when there are departures, they do not go very far from the familiar base: but in their way of using them we are as far as possible in its intrinsic principle from the method of the older poets. The change may be described as a more complete subordination of the metrical insistence to the inner suggestion of the movement. The old poets depended greatly on the metrical fall, made much of the external mould and its possible devices and filled it with the tones of life or thought or the excitement of the thing that possessed them and moved them to speech. Shakespeare's lines,\n\n>Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast\nSeal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains\nIn cradle of the rude imperious surge,\n\nare a supreme instance of the manner, or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>'s<span class='page-number' id='s-177' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.177]</span>\n\n>Those thoughts that wander through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span>,\n\nor any of his stately rolling lines or periods of organ music will do for a great illustration. Pope and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> simply overdid the reliance on measure and chained themselves up in a monotony of pointed metrical effect. The succeeding poets got back to the greater freedoms of tone and used them in a new way, but the principle remains the same,—as in Shelley's\n\n>Rarely, rarely comest thou,\n    Spirit of Delight,\n\nor Wordsworth's\n\n>For old unhappy far-off things\n    And battles long ago,—\n\nboth of them examples of the ordinary base used with a deep simplicity of single tone and a melodious insistence; or otherwise, where the tone on the contrary makes the most of the mould,\n\n>And wild-roses and ivy serpentine,\n\nor,\n\n>Breaking the silence of the seas\nAmong the farthest Hebrides.\n\nThe base of the old poetry is a march, a walk or a lilt, a measured flow, roll or surge,—or it is with less competent metrists a tripping trot, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dance</span> or gallop: but even in the freest movements there is a prevailing metrical insistence. In the new movement the old base is there, but whatever show it may make, its real importance tends to drop into a very second place. Insistence of tone has taken full possession of or even conquered the insistence of the fall. A spiritual intonation, not content to fill and at its strongest overflow the metrical mould, but insistent to take it into itself and carrying it rather than carried in it, is the secret of its melody or its harmony. There is here the sound of the coming in, perhaps only the first suggestion of a new music.<span class='page-number' id='s-178' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.178]</span>\n\nThe main reliance on the metrical stress can leave room in powerful hands for very great rhythms, but it has its limitations, from which different poets try to get release by different devices. Milton sought it in variations of pause and the engulfing swell of periods of large and resonant harmony, Swinburne by the cymbal clang of his alliterations and a rush and surge of assonant lyrical sound, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span> by a calculated roughness. Shakespeare himself under a great stress of crowding life and thought suggestions simply broke the back and joints of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> and tortured it into shapes from which he got out masterfully irregular harmonies sometimes of a great power, a process of which we may perhaps see in Whitmanesque free verse the far-off logical consequence. These more recent poets, whatever metrical devices they may use, depend upon something else, on a method which at its clearest becomes a principle of pure sound intonation.\n\nPhillips' blank verse which is of a very original mould, is built on this principle. The poet first gets as his basis the most simple, direct and easy form possible of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span>, which he can loosen as much as possible, suppress or shift or add as many stresses as he chooses, or on the contrary weigh extraordinarily upon his stresses so as to give an impression of long space or burdened lingering or some echo of infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duration</span>; but in either case the object is to get free room for the play of tone. Four lines come together,\n\n>The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of a flower in the air\nLiable but to breezes and to time,\nAs rich and purposeless as is the rose,\nThy simple doom is to be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span>,\n\nin which there are only three stresses, in the last one might almost say two and a half, a small number of quantitatively long syllables are the physical support of the verse,—as if quantity were trying to come back to first importance in a language of stresses,—and the rest is made up of varying minor tones. Or the long drawn out syllables are brought in in great abundance,<span class='page-number' id='s-179' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.179]</span> in a variety of combinations, closely packed and largely spaced, as in\n\n>The fiery funeral of foliage old,\n\nor,\n\n>With slow sweet surgery restore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>,\n\nor again,\n\n>The vault closed back, woe upon woe, the wheel\nRevolved, the stone rebounded, for that time\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hades</span> her interrupted life resumed.\n\nThese and others are the means used, but at their back is the principle of a free intonation. It is the tone that builds the verse, gives it its real form and the metrical mould, forced to become and to do whatever the tone chooses, whatever is needed for the intonation of the inmost thought, is a flexible convenience and a needed restraint,—for if loosened or freely spaced, it is not broken,—but no longer a chain and hardly felt even as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>. The significance is that the poet has a rhythm of thought and spirit already sounding somewhere within him and in bringing it out he imposes it consciously on his outer instrument with an imperious sovereignty and does not get to it, like the older masters, as the result of a faithful observance of the metrical harmony.\n\nThe other poets use a different, less open and forceful outer method, but the same principle emerges in greater or less degree as if by some spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>. Meredith's poetry belongs to an earlier technique, observes faithfully the metrical law, but the subtler thing is already coming: some curious turn is given to the beat which persistently compels it to serve some dominant soultone of the thought and seeing and to dance attendance on that, as in the four lines already quoted from *The Lark Ascending*, or else there is the turn towards long spaces and lingering tones where the metrical sound floats and seems always on the point of drowning in some deep sea of inner intonation,—<span class='page-number' id='s-180' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.180]</span>\n\n>Through widening chambers of surprise to where\nThrobs rapture near an end that aye recedes,\nBecause his touch is infinite and lends\nA yonder to all ends,—\n\na description which might well be applied to the whole drift and cause of this spiritual principle of rhythm. A. E. is not a great rhythmist, he is too preoccupied with his vision, more of a truth-seer than a truth-hearer of the Spirit, but when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> comes, the *śruti*, somehow or other without any expenditure of device the full spiritual intonation rises up and takes possession of the music,—to give one instance only,\n\n>Like winds and waters were her ways:\nThey heed not immemorial cries;\nThey move to their high destinies\nBeyond the little voice that prays.\n\nAnd in Yeats, a supreme artist in rhythm, this spiritual intonation is the very secret of all his subtlest melodies and harmonies and reveals itself whether in the use of old and common metres which cease to be either old or common in his hands or in delicate new turns of verse. We get it in his blank verse, taken at random,—\n\n>A sweet miraculous terrifying sound,—\n\nor in the mounting flight of that couplet on the flaming multitude\n\n>That rise, wing upon wing, flame above flame\nAnd like a storm cry the ineffable name,\n\nor heard through the slowly errant footfalls of that other,\n\n>In all poor foolish things that live a day\nEternal Beauty wandering on her way,—\n\nbut most of all in the lyrical movements,—\n\n>With all the earth and the sky and the water remade, like a casket of gold\nFor my dream of your image that blossoms, a rose in the deeps of my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-181' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.181]</span>\n\nThere we have, very near to the ear of the sense, that inaudible music floating the vocal music, the song unheard, or heard only behind and in the inner silence, to catch some echo of which is the privilege of music but also the highest intention of poetical rhythm.\n\nBeyond all analysis or set provision of means that is the constant attempt to which poetry must move, if this new realm is to open to its footsteps, not to suit the metre to the intellectual or even the emotional sense or to cast it in the moulds of life, but to seize some sound, some intonation of the voice of the soul, the lyric or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chandas</span>* or the large or simple measures of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> and creation, which, as the old Vedic theory would say, initiate, roll out and support all the steps of the universe. This intoned music in which the outer form becomes an external subtle means and suggestion, but the building power is other and brings in a spiritual accompaniment which is the real thing we have to listen to, opens at least one line on which we can arrive at that greater hearing whose wave can bring with it the inspiring word of a higher vision. For the musical tone of the older poetry is the simply sensuous, the emotional, the thought or the life tone with the spiritual cadence as the result of some strong intensity of these things, but here is some beginning of a direct spiritual intonation.<span class='page-number' id='s-182' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.182]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-ii","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Recent English Poetry - III","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-iii","prvt":"Recent English Poetry - I","prvu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-i","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["recent-english-poetry-iii"],"t":"Recent English Poetry - III","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The rhythmic change which distinguishes the new poetry, may not be easy to seize at the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span>, for it is a subtle thing in its spirit more than in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, commencing only and obscured by the outward adherence to the apparent turn-out and method of older <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>; but there is a change too, more readily tangible, in the language of this poetry, in that fusion of a concentrated substance of the idea and a transmuting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the speech which we mean by poetic style.

We take little account of the psychology of poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and are content with saying that the word of the poet is the speech of the imagination or that he works by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. But this is an insufficient account; for imagination is of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> different kinds and inspiration touches the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> at different levels and breaks out through different media before it issues through the gates of the creative imagination. What we mean by inspiration is that the impetus to poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and utterance comes to us from a superconscient source above the ordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, so that what is written seems not to be the fabrication of the brain-mind, but something more sovereign breathed or poured in from above. That is the possession by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> *enthousiasmos* of which Plato has spoken. But it is seldom that the whole word leaps direct from that source, that cavern of natal light ready-shaped and with the pure stamp of its divine origin,—ordinarily it goes through some secondary process in the brain-mind itself, gets its impulse and unformed substance perhaps from above, but subjects it to an intellectual or other earthly change; there is in that change always indeed<span class='page-number' id='s-183' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.183]</span> some superior power born of the excitement of the higher possession, but also some alloy too of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mortality</span>.

The Tantric theory of Speech, the inspired seeing and creative goddess enthroned in our various soul-centres in her several forms and with her higher and higher stations, becomes here an actual and luminously perceptible truth of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. But also there is in us a direct medium between that divine and this human mentality, an intuitive soul-mind supporting the rest, which has its share both in the transmission and the formal creation, and it is where this gets out into overt working, discloses its shaping touch or makes heard its transmitting voice that we get the really immortal tones of speech and heights of creation. And it is the epochs when there is in the mind of a race some enthusiastic outburst or some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> august action of this intuitive power, intermediary of the inspirations of the spirit or its revelations, that make the great ages of poetry.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> this period was the Elizabethan. Then the speech of poetry got into it a ring and turn of direct intuitive power, a spontaneous fullness of vision and divine fashion in its utterance which it had not at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> before and has hardly had afterwards. Even the lesser poets of the time are touched by it, but in Shakespeare it runs in a stream and condenses to a richly-loaded and crowding mass of the work and word of the intuition almost unexampled in any poetry. The difference can be measured by taking the work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span> or of subsequent poets almost at their best and of Shakespeare at a quite ordinary level and feeling the effect on the poetic listener in our own intuitive being. We take Chaucer with his easy adequate limpidity,—\n\n>He was a very parfit gentle knight,\n\nand then pass on to Shakespeare's rapid seizing of the intuitive inevitable word and the disclosing turn of phrase which admits us at once to a direct vision of the thing he shows us,—<span class='page-number' id='s-184' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.184]</span>\n\n>Of moving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>accidents</span> by flood and field,\nOf hair-breadth scapes in the imminent deadly breach,\n\nwhere with quite as simple a thing to say and a perfect force of directness in saying it, it is yet a vastly different kind of directness.

It is not merely a difference of the measure of the genius, but of its source. This language of Shakespeare's is a unique and wonderful thing; it has everywhere the royalty of the sovereign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> looking into and not merely at life and in this most myriad-minded of poets it takes like life itself many tones, but that intuitive readiness to get through, seize the lurking word and bring it out from the heart of the thing itself is almost always its secret. From that, he might have said, could he have given a better account of his own working, and not by any mere mirroring of things in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>,\n\n>It was my hint to speak, such was the process.\n\nWe are most readily struck in Shakespeare by the lines and passages in which the word thus seized and brought out is followed swiftly on the heels by another and another of its kind, many crowding together or even fused and run into each other in a single phrase of many suggestions,—for this manner is peculiarly his own and others can only occasionally come near to it. Such passages recur to the mind as those in the soliloquy on sleep or the well-known lines in *Macbeth*,\n\n>Pluck from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> a rooted sorrow,\nRaze out the written troubles of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>,\nAnd with some sweet oblivious antidote\nCleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff\nWhich weighs upon the heart.<span class='page-number' id='s-185' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.185]</span>\n\nHis is often a highly imaged style, but Shakespeare's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> are not, as with so many poets, decorative or brought in to enforce and visualise the intellectual sense, they are more immediately revelatory, intimate to the thing he speaks and rather the proper stuff of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> itself than images. But he has too a clearer, less crowded, still swifter fashion of speech in which they are absent; for an example,\n\n>    She should have died hereafter;\nThere would have been a time for such a word,—\n\nwhich has yet the same deep and penetrating intuitive spirit in its utterance. Or the two manners meet together and lean on each other,—\n\n>I have lived long enough; my way of life\nIs fallen into the sere, the yellow leaf,\n\nor become one, as in the last speeches of Antony,—\n\n>I am dying, Egypt, dying; only\nI here importune <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> awhile, until\nOf many thousand kisses the poor last\nI lay upon thy lips.\n\nBut all have the same characteristic stamp of the intuitive mind rapidly and powerfully at work; but always too,—and this is the important distinction,—that mediator between the secret spirit and our ordinary surface mentality works in him through and behind the life vision to give the vital impression, the vital psychology, the life-burden of the thought, the emotion, the act or the thing seen in Nature.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> that immediately followed, abandoned this power which Shakespeare and the Elizabethans had brought into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>; it sought after a language cut into the precision or full with the suggestions of the poetical intellect, and it gained something by its sacrifice; it purified the language, got rid of Elizabethan conceit and extravagance, laid a clearer basis of thought, went back to ordinary speech and raised it into a<span class='page-number' id='s-186' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.186]</span> fit <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the poetical imagination.

The later poets get a compensation in other directions by a heightening of the clarified thought and imagination, but the basic substance of the speech seems to have irrecoverably changed and its more tenuous spirit and make impose on the searching audacities of the intuition the curbing restraints and limits of the imaginative intelligence. Shelley's\n\n>Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought,\n\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>'\n\n>A thing of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> for ever,\n\nor his\n\n>To that large utterance of the early <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span>,\n\nor Wordsworth's\n\n>    the heavy and the weary weight\nOf all this unintelligible world,\n\ngive the force and pitch and measure of this often clear, strong, large and luminous, but less intensely surprising and uplifting manner. English poetry has got away from the Elizabethan outbreak nearer to a kinship with the mind and manner of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and Latin poets and their intellectual descendants, though still, it is to be noted, keeping something, a subtle and intimate turn, a power of fire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> which has become native to it, a legacy from the Shakespearian speech which was not there in its beginnings. This imaginatively intellectual basis of speech remains constant down to the end of the Victorian era.\n\nBut at the same time there emerges, at times, a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to recapture the Shakespearian potency and intensity accompanied by a new and higher element in the workings of the poetic<span class='page-number' id='s-187' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.187]</span> inspiration. When we try to put a name on it,—a thing which the poet himself seldom does successfully, for the creative instinct does not usually care to burden itself with a too intellectual self-consciousness,—we can see that this is an attempt to return to the fullness and the awakening turn of the direct intuitive expression on a subtler and more ethereal level. The clarified intellect observing life from above is in itself a higher thing than the vital and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional mind</span> which responds more immediately and powerfully to life, but is caught in its bonds; and if the direct intuitive power can be got to work on the level just above the ordinary thinking mind where that mind opens through the full intuitive intelligence to a greater supra-intellectual mass and subtlety of light, it will bring in the revelation and inspiration of mightier and profounder things than when it works from behind the mind—even the vividly thinking mind of life and its vital sight and feeling. For here, on the lower level, we get at most, as in Shakespeare, at the spirit in life with all its power of vital thought and its potency of passion and emotion; but there we shall get the greater spirit which embraces life, but shows us too all that is behind it, all that it dimly means and strives in embarrassed act and thought to bring into expression.

In the Victorian poets we get occasionally the same tendency in a stronger but less happy force; for it is weighted down by an increased <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span> by the robust strenuousness of the analytic intelligence, in Tennyson by the tendency to mere trimming of expression or glitter and wealth of artistic colour; but we have its voice sometimes, as in this line of the *Lotos-Eaters*,—\n\n>Portions and parcels of the dreadful past.\n\nBut it has not yet arrived, it is still seeking for itself, beating fitfully at the gates of the greater intuitive vision and expression.\n\nBut in more recent work it is precisely the recovery of this supreme power of speech on that loftier and subtler level which to one who comes freshly to this poetry breaks out with a sense of satisfying surprise and discovery. It is not complete; it is not everywhere; it is only just rising from the acquired basis of the previous heights of expression to its own realm; but it is there in a comparative abundance and it is the highest strain of its intensities.

The change that is coming or at least striving to come, might be described on the surface as a great and subtle deepening and enlarging of the thought-mind in the race and a new profounder, closer, more intimate way of seeing, feeling, appreciating, interpreting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. The thought of the middle and even the later nineteenth century was wide in its way, especially in its range and breadth of surface or in comparison with the narrower thought of the preceding ages, but it was acute rather than profound, superficial even in its attempt at penetration. It sought for its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> over a great country, but it did not wing high in the breadth of the altitudes or plunge down into the largeness of the depths. Perhaps the distinction is best marked by that significant movement of philosophic thought which now repelled by these limitations rejects the supremacy of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and seeks for the secret of things in the intuition, in the inmost suggestions of life, in the innate will and principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and points more or less obscurely through these things to a spirit or self or nameless somewhat superconscient to or at least greater than our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span></span> and reason.

Poetry has been affected by the turn of the human mind in this age; it has been brilliant, curious, careful, inventive, interested and interesting, moving over a great range of subjects, closely observative and even sometimes analytical, or elaborately aesthetic, or expressive of some intellectual idealism, but without much height of wing or force from the depths or strong or fine spiritual suggestion. Or there has been only some occasional suggestion or isolated foretaste of these things.

It is, to return to a phrase already used, in search of our inmost and attempting already to find, though it has not yet altogether found, our inmost way of its sense, vision, idea, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. This change, reflected in the poetry of the time is<span class='page-number' id='s-193' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.193]</span> not an abrupt turn or a casting away of the immediate past from which it was born, but a rapid development of new viewpoints, a shedding of restrictions and limitations and husks and externalities, a transformation by the entrance of a new force of the soul into possession of the gains of the intellectual age and a swift completion and filling of them out in a new flood of light and an at once nearer and more extended sense of their meaning. The whole view and sense of existence has deepened into a greater subjectivity. For the subjectivity of the nineteenth century was a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of the temperament, an activity of the strongly marked psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> turned upon things held under the lens as an object of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>; but now there are coming a universal subjectivity of the whole spirit, an attempt towards closeness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>, a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> with the universal soul and mind. The wider interest in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Man</span> has not lessened in breadth, but it is changing its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. More strenuous than before, it is less concentrated on his outer life and creation, and even where it deals with them, it opens more understandingly to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and to his inner possibilities, to the psychological and the spiritual sense of his past, to the deeper significance of his present, to his self-creation. The profounder ranges of his being are now sounded and there is an initial feeling and even some actual seeing of the greater individual and the communal or universal self of our kind. Nature is seen more in her hidden suggestions and soul meanings and in the finer impressions by which we enter into them and establish with her a spiritual relation or identity. The things that lie behind the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> world</span> are almost for the first time being touched and seen with a close and revealing intimacy.

This change amounts to a revolution of the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of man towards existence, but it is commencing by an extension of the intellectual stress and a<span class='page-number' id='s-194' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.194]</span> consequent breaking down of its bounds.

These things have not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> arrived, but they are on the way and the first waves of the surge have already broken over the dry beaches of the age of reason.\n\nThis considerable change was intellectually anticipated and to some extent prepared in the last century itself by a strain, a little thin in body, but high and continuous, of strenuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> which strove to rise beyond the level of the ordinary thought of the time to the full height and power of what the intellect of the race could then think out or create in the light of the inheritance of our ages. A small number of writers—in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Emerson</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carlyle</span>, Ruskin are the best known among these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span>,—build for us a bridge of transition from the intellectual transcendentalism of the earlier nineteenth century across a subsequent low-lying scientific, utilitarian, externalised intellectualism, as if from bank to bank across morass or flood, over to the age now beginning to come in towards us. But in the region of poetic thought and creation Whitman was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> prophetic mind which consciously and largely foresaw and prepared the paths and had some sense of that to which they are leading. He belongs to the largest mind of the nineteenth century by the stress and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of his intellectual seeking, by his emphasis on man and life and Nature, by his idea of the cosmic and universal, his broad spaces and surfaces, by his democratic enthusiasm, by his eye fixed on the future, by his intellectual reconciling vision at once of the greatness of the individual and the community of mankind, by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationalism</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>internationalism</span>, by his gospel of comradeship and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fraternity</span> in our common average manhood, by almost all in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of the immense mass of ideas which form the connecting tissue of his work. But he brings into them an element which gives them another potency and meaning and restores something which in most of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> of the time tended to be overcast and sicklied over by an excessive intellectual tendency more leaned to observe life than strong and swift to live it and which in the<span class='page-number' id='s-195' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.195]</span> practicality of the time was caught up from its healthful soul of nature and converted into a huge grinding mechanism. He has the intimate pulse and power of life vibrating in all he utters, an almost primitive force of vitality, delivered from the enormous mechanical beat of the time by a robust closeness to the very spirit of life,—that closeness he has more than any other poet since Shakespeare,—and ennobled by a lifting up of its earthly vigour into a broad and full intellectual freedom. Thought leads and all is made subject and object and substance of a free and a powerful thinking, but this insistence of thought is made one with the pulse of life and the grave reflective pallor and want of blood of an overburdened intellectualism is healed by that vigorous union. Whitman writes with a conscious sense of his high function as a poet, a clear self-conception and consistent idea of what he has to cast into speech,—\n\n>One's-self I sing, a simple separate person\nYet utter the word Democratic, the word En Masse...\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse and power,\nCheerful, for freest action formed under the laws divine,\nThe Modern Man I sing.\n\nNo other writer of the time has had this large and definite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of the work of a modern poet as a representative voice of his age, this inspiring vital sentiment of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> conceived as a myriad-souled pioneer of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human progress</span>, of mankind, of universal Nature, of the vast web of a universal thought and action. His creation, triumphing over all defect and shortcoming, draws from it a unique broadness of view, vitality of force and sky-wide atmosphere of greatness.\n\nBut beyond this representation of the largest thought and life and broadest turn to the future possible to his age, there is something else which arises from it all and carries us forward towards what is now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> to man around or above, towards a vision of new reaches and a profounder interpretation of existence. Whitman by the intensity of his intellectual and vital dwelling on the things he saw and expressed, arrives at some first profound sense of the greater self of the individual, of the greater self in<span class='page-number' id='s-196' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.196]</span> the community of the race and in all its immense past action opening down through the broadening eager present to an immenser future, of the greater self of Nature and of the eternal, the divine Self and Spirit of existence who broods over these things, who awaits them and in whom they come to the sense of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. That which the old Indian seers called the *mahān ātmā*, the Great Self, the Great Spirit, which is seen through the vast strain of the cosmic thought and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic life</span>,—the French poets, influenced in their form and substance by Whitman, have seized on this element with the clear discernment and intellectual precision and lucidity of the Latin mind and given it the name of unanimism,—is the subject of some of his highest strains. He gets to it repeatedly through his vision of the past opening to the ideal future, the organic universal movement of bygone nations and ages and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> and creation of the present and some nobler coming turn to a freedom of unified completion,—\n\n>The journey done, the journeyman come home,\nAnd man and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> with Nature fused again...\nThe Almighty leader now for once has signalled with his wand.\n\nAnd some part of his work, as in the *Passage to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>*, opens out even into a fuller and profounder sense of its meaning.

It is<span class='page-number' id='s-198' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.198]</span> in some degree an indication of that which the twentieth century is slowly turning to lay hold of, to develop and to make its own in a closer actuality of insight and experience.\n\nThe idea in these and cognate passages anticipates the new age, but the language and method are still that of the poetic intellect straining to some fullest power of its intelligence and speech-force, and the thought and writing of those who follow Whitman, like the French \"unanimist\" poets, bear the same character. At the centre of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> itself, we have found another turn of intuitive speech which is more native to that closer actuality of experience for which we seek, a turn and power brought about perhaps by the greater fire of poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and imagination, the special gift of the Anglo-Celtic mind, which leaps at once to the forceful, native, instinctive energy of poetic expression of the thing it has to say. The full idea of that thing, the large and clearly conceived substance of thought and vision which should fill this mould of intuitive utterance, we do not get in any considerable degree or range,—again perhaps because of the inferior turn for large and straight thinking on the great scale, a full-orbed thinking with a sustained and total conception, which is the defect of the English mind,—but we have constant partial intuitions in detail and a treatment of life and thought and nature which presses towards the greater coming significance. That is as yet only one strain of recent poetry, but it is the most powerful and original and turns sometimes almost with a full face towards the future. These are strong touches only, but they give already some impression and mould of the thing that has to be, the ultimate creation. A new intuitive interpretation of the soul and mind of man, of the soul and mind in Nature, a thought which casts its fathom beyond the passion of life and the clarity of the intelligence and starts sounding a suggestion of the hidden and the infinite in all it touches is the shaping power and the mode of this utterance.\n\nThe citations I have already given to illustrate the new rhythm and language indicate also this power and thought-turn in the substance. A few more citations from the same poets may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to bring it out with more precision. The early and greater<span class='page-number' id='s-199' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.199]</span> poetry of Phillips has much of this stamp,—afterwards he unhappily turned to a more outward dramatic motive which was not the true and original bent of his genius, but even there his best is that which prolongs the high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of his first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. He has no great conscious range of poetical thinking, but all the more remarkable is the power with which this new influence comes out in what he can give us. We note a new treatment of life and human emotion. The love of Idas for Marpessa is not satisfied with the old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of passion and feeling and imaginative idealism, there are here other notes which carry the individual emotion out of itself and strive to cast it into unity with the life of Nature and the whole past life and love of humanity and the eternal continuity of passion and seeking and all the suggestion of the Infinite. The very passion for physical beauty takes on this almost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> character; it is the passion for a body\n\n>            packed with sweet\nOf all this world, that cup of brimming June,\nThat jar of violet wine set in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span>,\nThat palest rose sweet in the night of life.\n\nBut, says Idas,\n\n>Not for this only do I love thee, but\nBecause <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinity</span> upon thee broods,\nAnd thou art full of whispers and of shadows.\nThou meanest what the sea has striven to say\nSo long, and yearned up to the cliffs to tell;\nThou art what all the winds have uttered not,\nWhat the still night suggesteth to the heart.\nThy voice is like to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> heard ere birth,\nSome spirit lute touched on a spirit sea;\nThy face remembered is from other worlds.\nIt has been died for though I know not where,\nIt has been sung of though I know not when.\nI am aware of other times and lands,\nOf births far back, of lives in many stars.<span class='page-number' id='s-200' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.200]</span>\n\nHere we have the reconciliation, already suggested by Whitman, of the full power and meaning of the individual with the full power and meaning of the universal, eternal and infinite, but it is concentrated and brought to bear on a single feeling for its enlargement with a great power of intuitive and revealing suggestion. This enlarging of the particular to meet and become one with the universal and infinite—Tennyson's knowing of what God and man is from a deep and intimate perception of all that is meant by Nature in a single little flower in the crannies—is a very characteristic and indicative feature of this new poetry.\n\nThe same turn emerges in a more indirect and subtle, but not less significant way of treatment even in lines which apparently seek only to concentrate for the thought the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of a common human idea and emotion. When the poet speaks of\n\n><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beautiful</span> friendship tried by sun and wind,\nDurable from the daily dust of life,\n\nor of Marpessa's maternal human longing,\n\n>And he shall give me passionate children, not\nSome radiant god that will despise me quite,\nBut clambering limbs and little hearts that err,\n\nthe thought in itself is not uncommon, but what makes it uncommon is the turn of the utterance which by an intuitive pressure towards some deeper significance of the personal thought and emotion carries it beyond the personality of the idea and feeling into a suggestion of profound universality, a rhythm and light of some entire vibration from the depths of life caught up and held by a human self-knowledge. The same force of suggestion emerges in the treatment of Nature, whether it takes the form of an intensity of sensation,\n\n>            the moment deep\nWhen we are conscious of the secret dawn\nAmidst the darkness that we feel is green,<span class='page-number' id='s-201' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.201]</span>\n\nor passes through that intensity to the sense of the very soul and emotion of what seems to us in less seeing moods an inconscient and inanimate Nature, as in the\n\n>                trees\nMotionless in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of rain.\n\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Meredith</span> with his greater force of thinking gives us the clear significance of what is here only a powerful indication, a seeing identity of the soul of man with the hidden soul in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span>.\n\n>I neighbour the invisible\nSo close that my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span>\nIs only asked for spirits masked\nTo leap from trees and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span>.\nAnd this because with them I dwell\nIn thought, while calmly bent\nTo read the lines dear earth designs\nShall speak her life on ours.\n\nAnd the same turn emerges too in direct thought on the large aspects of life, as in such a phrase as\n\n>Lonely antagonist of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>,\n\nor that which describes\n\n>The listless ripple of oblivion,\n\nlines which give us by some deep suggestion to the spiritual sight a whole abiding soul aspect of man and the universe in a single revealing expression. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of poetry of this kind of inspiration may be defined by adapting another expression of Meredith's,\n\n>To spell the letters of the sky and read\nA reflex upon earth else meaningless.<span class='page-number' id='s-202' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.202]</span>\n\nAnd the fullness of that which it points to beyond itself, is a movement to unite the life of the earth, not lessened, not denied, not cast away, but accepted, with its own hidden spiritual reality, the one crucial movement necessary for man before he can reach that perfection which the race shall have on its heights, when\n\n>The vile plucked out of them, the unlovely slain,\nNot forfeiting the beast with which they are crossed,\nTo stature of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span> they shall attain.\nThey shall uplift their earth to meet her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>,\nThemselves the attuning chord.\n\nThis is in substance the same strain that arises finally from the more puissant voice of Whitman, but it has if a less forceful, a profounder touch,—a more delicate, intimate and spiritual closeness of seeing, experience and utterance is its charm and distinction.\n\nThe indications that we get in these and other English poets open to a clearer totality in the two great Irish voices. They have, helped by the strand of a spiritual lucidity of thought in the finer Celtic mind, a sustained and conscious idea of the thing that is most inwardly stirring them to utterance. That shapes into a singular light, delicacy and beauty the whole of Yeats' poetry. Here I must be content to note three of its more distinctive features, the remarkable interweaving into one, whether against a background of Irish tradition and legend or by a directer thought, of the earthly life of man with the unseen psychical life which, if we could only see it, as we can when we go back from the frontage of things into the inner soul-spaces, presses upon the earth-life and supports it, so that at times our world seems only its detached projection; the reading through the signs of life of the brighter letters of an ideal and eternal Beauty; the insistence, even when touching exclusively our external life, on the suggestion of finer soul-values which exceed its material meanings. The poetry of A. E. is still more remarkable. What the others suggest or give us in more or less luminous glimpses, he casts into concentrated expression from a nearer spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>,—as when he<span class='page-number' id='s-203' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.203]</span> strikes out in a brief verse the living spiritual perception of the universal and infinite source of love,—\n\n>We bade adieu to love the old,\nWe heard another lover then,\nWhose forms are myriad and untold,\nSigh to us from the hearts of men.\n\nHe lives on the spiritual plane to which so much of this poetry is an indistinct or a less distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, and his whole self-expression is bathed, perhaps rendered sometimes a little remote and unseizable by its immergence, in an unusual light, the light of the spirit breaking through the veils of the intelligence in which it has to find its means of speech. This is not the frank <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>marriage</span> and close unity of the earth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> of which Whitman and Meredith speak, but a rare, high and exclusive pinnacle of the soul's greater sight. The rest of this side of recent poetry is a climbing or pointing up from the earth-levels to the heights of Truth; but from one region of those loftiest elevations this sight looks down and opens its eye of light on the life of man and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cycles</span> of the universe.<span class='page-number' id='s-204' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.204]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-iv","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"New Birth or Decadence?","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/new-birth-or-decadence","prvt":"Recent English Poetry - III","prvu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-iii","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["new-birth-or-decadence"],"t":"New Birth or Decadence?","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"At this point we stand in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry.

Its fundamental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>, function and law are no doubt always the same, because each thing and each <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> too in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> must be faithful to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> idea in it, to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>, and can try to depart from it only on peril, whatever momentarily it may seem to gain, of eventual inferiority and futility, or even of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>. But still there is an evolution within this law of its being. And evolution means a bringing out of new powers which lay concealed in the seed or the first form; the simple develops to the more complex,—more complex even in some apparent simplicity,—the superficial gives place to the more and more profound, the lesser gives place to the greater nature of the common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>. But poetry is a psychological phenomenon, the poetic impulse a highly charged <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the mind and soul of man, and therefore in trying to follow out its line of evolution it is the development of the psychological motive and power, it is the kind of feeling, vision, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> which is seeking in it for its word and idea and form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and it is the power of<span class='page-number' id='s-205' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.205]</span> the soul through which it finds expression or the level of mind from which it speaks which we must distinguish to get a right idea of the progress of poetry. All else is subsidiary, variations of rhythm, language, structure; they are the form, the vehicle; they derive subtly and get their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and meaning from the psychological power and the fundamental motive.\n\nIf poetry is a highly charged power of aesthetic expression of the soul of man, it must follow in its course of evolution the development of that soul. I put it that from this point of view the soul of man like the soul of Nature can be regarded as an unfolding of the spirit in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> world</span>.

Arrived to a greater depth of living, seeing from<span class='page-number' id='s-206' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.206]</span> a vivid half outward half inward turn of mind his thought and action and self and world and Nature, man begins to feel more sensitively the passion and power of life, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and pain, its wonder and terror and beauty and romance, to turn everything into moved thought and sentiment and sensation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span>, the desire soul in him which first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> itself on his introspection when he begins to go inward. Poetry too takes this turn, rises and deepens to a new kind of greatness; and at the summit in this kind we have Shakespeare.\n\n[^1]: As in the hymns of the Vedic Rishis.\n\nThis way of seeing and creating, in which thought is involved in life and the view is that of the life-spirit feeling, thinking, imagining, carried forward in its own surge of self, cannot permanently hold the greater activities of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>. He ceases to identify himself entirely with the passion, the emotion, the thought-suggestions of life; for he needs to know from a freer height what it is and what he is, to get a clear detached idea of its workings, to dominate his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and vital intuitions and see with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> eye of his reason, to probe, analyse, get at the law and cause and general and particular rule of himself and Nature. He does this at first on large and comparatively bare lines dwelling only on the salient details for a first strong and provisionally adequate view. Poetry following this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> takes on the lucid, restrained, intellectual and ideal classic form, in which high or strong ideas govern and develop the presentation of life and thought in an atmosphere of clear beauty and the vision of the satisfied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>; that is the greatness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and Latin poets. But afterwards the intelligence sets more comprehensively to work, opens itself to all manner of the possibilities of truth and to a crowding stream and mass of interests, a never satisfied minuteness of detail, an endless succession of pregnant generalisations. This is the type of modern intellectualism.\n\nThe poetry which arises from this mentality is full of a teeming many-sided poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideation</span> which takes up the external and life motives not for their own sake, but to make them <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> for the poetic intelligence, blends the classical and romantic motives, adds to them the realistic, aesthetic, impressionist, idealistic<span class='page-number' id='s-207' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.207]</span> ways of seeing and thinking, makes many experiments and combinations, passes through many phases. The true classic form is then no longer possible; if it is tried, it is not quite genuine, for what informs it is no longer the classic spirit; it is too crowded with subtle thought-matter, too brooding, sensitive, responsive to many things; no new Parthenon can be built whether in the white marble subdued to the hand or in the pure and lucid spacings of the idea and the word: the mind of man has become too full, complex, pregnant with subtle and not easily expressible things to be capable of that earlier type of perfection. The romantic strain is a part of this wider intelligence, but the pure and genuine romanticism of the life-spirit which cares nothing for thought except as it enriches its own being, is also no longer possible. If it tries to get back to that, it falls into an affectation, an intellectual pose and, whatever <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> may be expended upon it, this kind cannot remain long alive. That is the secret of the failure of modern romanticism in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span>. In Germany, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Heine</span> alone got away from this falsity and were able to use this strain in its proper way as one enriching chord serving the complex harmonic purpose of the intelligence; the rest of German literary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of the time is interesting and suggestive in its way, but very little of it is intimately alive and true, and afterwards Germany failed to keep up a sustained poetic impulse; she turned aside to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> on the one side and on the other to philosophy and science for her field. The French mind got away very soon from romanticism and, though greatly enriched by its outbreak into that phase, went on to a more genuine intellectual and intellectually aesthetic form of creation. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> with the greater spontaneity of its poetic spirit the mistake never went so far. The poetry of the time of Wordsworth and Shelley is sometimes called romantic poetry, but it was not so in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>, but only in certain of its moods and motives. It lives really by its greater and more characteristic element, by its half spiritual turn, by Wordsworth's force of ethical thought and communion with Nature, by Shelley's imaginative transcendentalism, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>' worship of Beauty, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span>'s Titanism and force of personality, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Coleridge</span>'s supernaturalism or, as it should more<span class='page-number' id='s-208' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.208]</span> properly be called, his eye for other nature, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Blake</span>'s command of the inner psychic realms. Only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> was there, owing to the prestige of Shakespeare, an attempt at pure romanticism, and therefore in this domain nothing great and living could be done, but only a record of failures. Realism is a more native turn of this kind of intelligence, and it invades poetry too to a certain extent, but if it dominates, then poetry must decline and cease. The poetry of an age of many-sided intellectualism can live only by its many-sidedness and by making everything as it comes a new material for the aesthetic creations of the observing, thinking, constructing intelligence.\n\nBut then comes the now vital question in this cultural evolution,—in what is this intellectualism to culminate? For if it leads to nothing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> itself, it must end, however brilliant its work, in a poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span>, and that must come nearer, the more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> dominates the other powers of our being. The intellect moves naturally between two limits, the abstractions or solving analyses of the reason and the domain of positive and practical reality; its great achievements are in these two fields or in a mediation between them, and it can do most and go farthest, can achieve its most native and characteristic and therefore its greatest and completest work either in philosophy or in Science. The age of developed intellectualism in Greece killed poetry; it ended in the comedy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Menander</span>, the intellectual artificialities of Alexandrianism, the last flush of beauty in the aesthetic pseudo-naturalism of the Sicilian pastoral poetry; philosophy occupied the field. In the more rich and complex modern mind this result could not so easily come and has not yet come. At the same time the really great, perfect and securely characteristic work of the age has not been in the field of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and poetry, but in critical thought and science. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Criticism</span> and science, by a triumphant force of abstraction and analysis turned on the world of positive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, have in this period been able to become enormously effective for life. They have been able to reign sovereignly, not so much by their contributions to pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, but by their practical, revolutionary and constructive force. If modern thought with its immense scientific achievement has not enriched life at its<span class='page-number' id='s-209' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.209]</span> base or given it a higher and purer action,—it has only created a yet unrealised possibility in that direction by its idealistic side,—it has wonderfully equipped it with powerful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> and an imposing paraphernalia and wrought conspicuous and unprecedented changes in its superstructure. But poetry in this atmosphere has kept itself alive not by any native and spontaneous power born of agreement between its own essential spirit and the spirit of the age, but by a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of the imagination and aesthetic intelligence labouring for the most part to make the best of what material it could get in the shape of new thought and new view-points for the poetic criticism or the thoughtful presentation of life. It has been an aesthetic byplay rather than a leading or sometimes even premier force in the cultural life of the race such as it was in the ancient ages and even, with a certain limited action, in more recent times.\n\nThat a certain decline, not of the activity of the poetic mind, but of its natural vigour, importance and effective power has been felt, if not quite clearly appreciated in its causes, we can see from various significant indications. Throughout the later nineteenth century one observes a constant apprehension of approaching aesthetic decadence, a tendency to be on the look-out for it and to find the signs of it in innovations and new turns in art and poetry. The attempt to break the whole mould of poetry and make a new thing of it so that it may be easier to handle and may shape itself to all the turns, the high and low, noble and common, fair or unseemly movements of the modern mind and its varied interest in life, is itself due to a sense of some difficulty, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and unease, some want of equation between the fine but severely self-limiting character of this kind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative power</span> and the spirit of the age. At one time indeed it was hardily predicted that since the modern mind is increasingly scientific and less and less poetically and aesthetically imaginative, poetry must necessarily decline and give place to science,—for much the same reason, in fact, for which philosophy replaced poetry in Greece. On the opposite side it was sometimes suggested that the poetic mind might become more positive and make use of the materials of science or might undertake a more intellectual<span class='page-number' id='s-210' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.210]</span> though always poetic criticism of life and might fill the place of philosophy and religion which were supposed for a time to be dead or dying powers in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span>; but this came to the same thing, for it meant a deviation from the true law of aesthetic creation and only a more protracted decadence.\n\nAnd behind these uneasy suggestions lay the one fact that for causes already indicated an age of reason dominated by the critical, scientific or philosophic intelligence is ordinarily unfavourable and, even when it is most catholic and ample, cannot be quite favourable to great poetic creation. The pure intellect cannot create poetry. The inspired or the imaginative reason does indeed play an important, sometimes a leading part, but even that can only be a support or an influence; the thinking mind may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to give a final shape, a great and large form, *saṁ mahemā manīṣayā*, as the Vedic poets said of the Mantra, but the word must start first from a more intimate sense in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span>, *hṛdā taṣṭam*; it is the spirit within and not the mind without that is the fount of poetry. Poetry too is an interpreter of truth, but in the forms of an innate beauty, and not so much of intellectual truth, the truths offered by the critical mind, as of the intimate truth of being. It deals not so much with things thought as with things seen, not with the authenticities of the analytic mind, but with the authenticities of the synthetic vision and the seeing spirit. The abstractions, generalisations, minute precisions of our ordinary intellectual cerebration are no part of its essence or texture; but it has others, more luminous, more subtle, those which come to us after passing through the medium and getting drenched in the light of the intuitive and revealing mind. And therefore when the general activity of thought runs predominantly into the former kind, the works of the latter are apt to proceed under rather anaemic conditions, they are affected by the pervading atmosphere; poetry either ceases or falls into a minor strain or takes refuge in virtuosities of its outer instruments and aids or, if it still does any considerable work, lacks the supreme spontaneity, the natural perfection, the sense of abundant ease or else of sovereign mastery which the touch of the<span class='page-number' id='s-211' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.211]</span> spirit manifests even amidst the fullest or austerest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of its creation.\n\nBut this incompatibility is not the last word of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>. The truth which poetry expresses takes two forms, the truth of life and the truth of that which works in life, the truth of the inner spirit. It may take its stand on the outer life and work in an intimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>, relation or close dwelling upon it, and then what it does is to bring some light of intuitive things, some power of revelation of the beauty that is truth and the truth that is beauty into the outer things of life, even into those that are most common, obvious, of daily occurrence. But also it may get back into the truth of the inner spirit and work in an intimate identity, relation or close dwelling upon it, and then what it will do is to give a new revelation of our being and life and thought and Nature and the material and the psychical and spiritual worlds. That is the effort to which it seems to be turning now in its most characteristic, effective and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> manifestations. But it cannot fully develop in this sense unless the general mind of the age takes that turn. There are signs that this will indeed be the outcome of the new direction taken by the modern mind, not an intellectual petrifaction or a long spinning in the grooves of a critical intellectualism, but a higher and more authentic thinking and living. The human intelligence seems on the verge of an attempt to rise through the intellectual into an intuitive mentality; it is no longer content to regard the intellect and the world of positive fact as all or the intellectual reason as a sufficient mediator between life and the spirit, but is beginning to perceive that there is a spiritual mind which can admit us to a greater and more comprehensive vision. This does not mean any sacrifice of the gains of the past, but a raising and extending of them not only by a seeking of the inner as well as the outer truth of things, but also of all that binds them together and a bringing of them into true relation and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. A first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> out to this new way of seeing is the sense of the work of Whitman and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span> and some of the recent French poets, of Tagore and Yeats and A. E., of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Meredith</span> and some others of the English poets. There are critics who regard this tendency as only another<span class='page-number' id='s-212' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.212]</span> sign of decadence; they see in it a morbid brilliance, a phosphorescence of decay or the phosphorescence which we observe on the sea when the sun has gone down and night occupies the waters. But this is to suppose that poetry can only repeat what it has done in the past and can accomplish no new and great thing and that a clear, strong or brilliant dealing with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer mind</span> and world is its last word and the one condition of its healthy creativeness. There is much that is morbid, perverse or unsound in some recent poetry; but this comes from an artificial prolongation of the past or a temporary mixed straining, it does not belong to that element in the new poetry which escapes from it and turns firmly to the things of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. Decadence arrives when in the decline of a culture there is nothing more to be lived or seen or said, or when the poetic mind settles irretrievably into a clumsy and artificial repetition of past forms and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conventions</span> or can only escape from them into scholastic or aesthetic prettinesses or extravagance. But an age which brings in large and new vital and spiritual truths, truths of our being, truths of the self of man and the inner self of Nature and opens vast untrod ranges to sight and imagination, is not likely to be an age of decadence, and a poetry which voices these things,—unless its creative power has been fatally atrophied by long conventionalism, and that is not at present our case,—is not likely to be a poetry of decadence.\n\nThe more perfectly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive poetry</span> of the future, supposing it to emerge successfully from its present incubation, find itself and develop all its possibilities, will not be a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> poetry recondite in expression or quite remote from the earthly life of man. Some element of the kind may be there; for always when we open into these fields, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysteries</span> more than the Orphic or the Eleusinian revive and some of them are beyond our means of expression; but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span> in its unfavourable or lesser sense comes when either we glimpse but do not intimately realise the now secret things of the spirit or, realising, yet cannot find their direct language, their intrinsic way of utterance, and have to use obscurely luminous hints or a thick drapery of symbol, when we have the revelation, but not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>, the sight but<span class='page-number' id='s-213' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.213]</span> not the word. And remoteness comes when we cannot relate the spirit with life or bring the power of the spirit to transmute the other members of our being. But the new age is one which is climbing from a full <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> towards some possibility of an equal fullness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span>, and the full intuitive mind, not that of glimpses, but of a luminous totality, opens to the mind of revelation and inspiration. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span>, whether it take form in the word of the poet or in the word of the illumined thinker, the prophet or the seer, can be one of the main gateways. And what the age will aim at is neither <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span> nor an intuitive vitalism nor a remote detached spirituality, but a harmonious and luminous totality of man's being. Therefore to this poetry the whole field of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> will be open for its subject, God and Nature and man and all the worlds, the field of the finite and the infinite. It is not a close, even a high close and ending in this or any field that the future offers to us, but a new and higher evolution, a second and greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of all man's powers and his being and action and creation.<span class='page-number' id='s-214' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.214]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/new-birth-or-decadence","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Ideal Spirit of Poetry","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-ideal-spirit-of-poetry","prvt":"Recent English Poetry - IV","prvu":"/cwsa/26/recent-english-poetry-iv","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-ideal-spirit-of-poetry"],"t":"The Ideal Spirit of Poetry","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"To attempt to presage the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> turn or development of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in any of its fields must always be a hazardous venture.

We can see where we stand today, but we cannot tell where we shall stand a quarter of a century hence. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> can do is to distinguish for oneself some possibilities that lie before the poetic mind of the race and to figure what it can achieve if it chooses to follow out certain great openings which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of recent and contemporary poets has made free to us; but what path it will actually choose to tread or what new heights attempt, waits still for its own yet unformed decision.\n\nWhat would be the ideal spirit of poetry in an age of the increasingly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span>: that is the question which arises from all that has gone before and to which we may attempt some kind of answer. I have spoken in the beginning of the Mantra as the highest and intensest revealing form of poetic thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. What the Vedic poets meant by the Mantra was an inspired and revealed seeing and visioned thinking, attended by a realisation, to use the ponderous but necessary modern word, of some inmost truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and self and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and Nature and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span> and life and thing and thought and experience and deed. It was a thinking that came on the wings of a great soul rhythm, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chandas</span>*. For the seeing could not be separated from<span class='page-number' id='s-217' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.217]</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span>; it was one act. Nor could the living of the truth in oneself which we mean by realisation, be separated from either, for the presence of it in the soul and its possession of the mind must precede or accompany in the creator or human channel that expression of the inner sight and hearing which takes the shape of the luminous word. The Mantra is born through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and shaped or massed by the thinking mind into a chariot of that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> of whom the truth seen is a face or a form. And in the mind too of the fit outward hearer who listens to the word of the poet-seer, these three must come together, if our word is a real Mantra; the sight of the inmost truth must accompany the hearing, the possession of the inmost spirit of it by the mind and its coming home to the soul must accompany or follow immediately upon the rhythmic message of the Word and the mind's sight of the Truth. That may sound a rather <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> account of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, but substantially there could hardly be a more complete description of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> and effect of the inspired and revealing word, and it might be applied, though usually on a more lowered scale than was intended by the Vedic Rishis, to all the highest outbursts of a really great poetry. But poetry is the Mantra only when it is the voice of the inmost truth and is couched in the highest power of the very rhythm and speech of that truth. And the ancient poets of the Veda and Upanishads claimed to be uttering the Mantra because always it was this inmost and almost occult truth of things which they strove to see and hear and speak and because they believed themselves to be using or finding its innate soul rhythms and the sacrificial speech of it cast up by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Agni</span>, the sacred Fire in the heart of man. The Mantra in other words is a direct and most heightened, an intensest and most divinely burdened rhythmic word which embodies an intuitive and revelatory <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and ensouls the mind with the sight and the presence of the very self, the inmost reality of things and with its truth and with the divine soul-forms of it, the Godheads which are born from the living Truth. Or, let us say, it is a supreme rhythmic language which seizes hold upon all that is finite and brings into each the light and voice of its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-218' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.218]</span>\n\nThis is a theory of poetry, a view of the rhythmic and creative self-expression to which we give that name, which is very different from any that we now hold, a sacred or hieratic *ars poetica* only possible in days when man believed himself to be near to the gods and felt their presence in his bosom and could think he heard some accents of their divine and eternal wisdom take form on the heights of his mind. And perhaps no thinking age has been so far removed from any such view of our life as the one through which we have recently passed and even now are not well out of its shadow, the age of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span>, the age of positive outward matter of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> and of scientific and utilitarian reason. And yet curiously enough—or naturally, since in the economy of Nature opposite creates itself out of opposite and not only like from like,—it is to some far-off light at least of the view of ourselves at our greatest of which such ideas were a concretised expression that we seem to be returning. For we can mark that although in very different circumstances, in broader <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, with a more complex mind and an enormously enlarged basis of culture and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, the gain and inheritance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> intermediate ages, it is still to something very like the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> which was the soul of the Vedic or at least the Vedantic mind that we almost appear to be on the point of turning back in the circle of our course. Now that we have seen minutely what is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> reality of the world in which we live and have some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the vital reality of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Force</span> from which we spring, we are at last beginning to seek again for the spiritual reality of that which we and all things secretly are. Our minds are once more trying to envisage the self, the spirit of Man and the spirit of the universe, intellectually, no doubt, at first, but from that to the old effort at sight, at realisation within ourselves and in all is not a very far step. And with this effort there must rise too on the human mind the conception of the godheads in whom this Spirit, this marvellous Self and Reality which broods over the world, takes shape in the liberated soul and life of the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>, his godheads of Truth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Freedom</span> and Unity, his godheads of a greater more highly visioned Will and Power, his godheads of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span> and universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Delight</span>, his godheads of universal and<span class='page-number' id='s-219' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.219]</span> eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beauty</span>, his godheads of a supreme Light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Harmony</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Good</span>. The new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> of the race seem already to be affected by some first bright shadow of these things, and even though it be only a tinge, a flush colouring the duller atmosphere of our recent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, there is every sign that this tinge will deepen and grow, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> to which we look up if not at once in the earth of our actual life.\n\nBut this new vision will not be as in the old times something hieratically remote, mystic, inward, shielded from the profane, but rather a sight which will endeavour to draw these godheads again to close and familiar intimacy with our earth and embody them not only in the heart of religion and philosophy, nor only in the higher flights of thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, but also, as far as may be, in the common life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of man. For in the old days these things were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mysteries</span>, which men left to the few, to the initiates and by so leaving them lost sight of them in the end, but the endeavour of this new mind is to reveal, to divulge and to bring near to our comprehension all mysteries,—at present indeed making them too common and outward in the process and depriving them of much of their beauty and inner light and depth, but that defect will pass,—and this turn towards an open realisation may well lead to an age in which man as a race will try to live in a greater Truth than has as yet governed our kind. For all that we know, we now tend to make some attempt to form clearly and live. His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> too will then be moved by another spirit and cast on other lines.\n\nAnd if this takes place or even if there is some strong mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> towards it, poetry may recover something of an old sacred prestige. There will no doubt still be plenty of poetical writing which will follow the old lines and minister to the old commoner aesthetic motives, and it is as well that it should be so, for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of poetry is to express the soul of man to himself and to embody in the word whatever power of beauty he sees; but also there may now emerge too and take the first place souls no longer niggardly of the highest flame, the poet-seer and seer-creator, the poet who is also a Rishi, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> singers of Truth, hierophants and magicians of a diviner and more<span class='page-number' id='s-220' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.220]</span> universal beauty. There has no doubt always been something of that in the greatest masters of poetry in the great ages, but to fulfil such a role has not often been the one fountain idea of their function; the mind of the age has made other demands on them, needed at that time, and the highest things in this direction have been rare self-exceedings and still coloured by and toned to the half light in which they sang. But if an age comes which is in common possession of a deeper and greater and more inspiring Truth, then its masters of the rhythmic word will at least sing on a higher common level and may rise more often into a fuller intenser light and capture more constantly the greater tones of which this harp of God, to use the Upanishad's description of man's created being, is secretly capable.\n\nA greater era of man's living seems to be in promise, whatever nearer and earthier powers may be striving to lead him on a side path away to a less exalted ideal, and with that advent there must come a new great age of his creation different from the past epochs which he counts as his glories and superior to them in its vision and motive. But first there must intervene a poetry which will lead him towards it from the present faint beginnings. It will be aided by new views in philosophy, a changed and extended spirit in science and new revelations in the other arts, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, painting, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span>, sculpture, as well as high new ideals in life and new powers of a reviving but no longer limited or obscurantist religious mind. A glint of this change is already visible. And in poetry there is already the commencement of such a greater leading; the conscious effort of Whitman, the tone of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span>, the significance of the poetry of A. E., the rapid immediate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> of Tagore are its first signs. The idea of the poet who is also the Rishi has made again its appearance. Only a wider spreading of the thought and mentality in which that idea can live and the growth of an accomplished art of poetry in which it can take <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, are still needed to give the force of permanence to what is now only an incipient and just emerging power. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mankind</span> satiated with the levels is turning its face once more towards the heights, and the poetic voices that will lead us thither with song will be among the high seer voices. For the great poet interprets<span class='page-number' id='s-221' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.221]</span> to man his present or reinterprets for him his past, but can also point him to his future and in all three reveal to him the face of the Eternal.\n\nAn intuitive revealing poetry of the kind which we have in view would voice a supreme harmony of five eternal powers, Truth, Beauty, Delight, Life and the Spirit. These are indeed the five greater ideal lamps or rather the five suns of poetry. And towards three of them the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher mind</span> of the race is in many directions turning its thought and desire with a new kind and force of insistence. The intellectual side of our recent progress has in fact been for a long time a constant arduous pursuit of Truth in certain of its fields; but now the limited truth of yesterday can no longer satisfy or bind us. Much has been known and discovered of a kind which had not been found or had only been glimpsed before, but the utmost of that much appears now very little compared with the infinitely more which was left aside and ignored and which now invites our search. The description which the old Vedic poet once gave of the seeking of divine Truth, applies vividly to the mind of our age, \"As it climbs from height to height, there becomes clear to its view all the much that is yet to be done.\" But also it is beginning to be seen that only in some great awakening of the self and spiritual being of man is that yet unlived truth to be found and that infinite much to be achieved. It is only then that the fullness of a greater knowledge for man living on earth can unfold itself and get rid of its coverings and again on his deeper mind and soul, in the words of another Vedic poet-seer, \"New states come into birth, covering upon covering awaken to knowledge, till in the lap of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> one wholly sees.\" This new-old light is now returning upon our minds. Men no longer so completely believe that the world is a machine and they only so much transient thinking matter, a view of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in the midst of which however helpful it might be to a victorious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> on physical science and social economy and material well-being, neither religion nor philosophic wisdom could renew their power in the fountains of the spirit nor art and poetry, which are also things of the soul like religion and wisdom, refresh themselves from their native<span class='page-number' id='s-222' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.222]</span> sources of strength. Now we are moving back from the physical obsession to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> that there is a soul and greater self within us and the universe which finds expression here in the life and the body.\n\nBut the mind of today insists too and rightly insists on life, on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, on the dignity of our labour and action. We have no longer any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> quarrel with our mother earth, but rather would drink full of her bosom of beauty and power and raise her life to a more perfect greatness. Thought now dwells much on the idea of a vast creative will of life and action as the secret of existence. That way of seeing, though it may give room for a greater power of art and poetry and philosophy and religion, for it brings in real soul-values, has by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> its own dangers. A spirit which is all life because it is greater than life, is rather the truth in which we shall most powerfully live. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aditi</span>, the infinite Mother, cries in the ancient Vedic hymn to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indra</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> now about to be born in her womb, \"This is the path of old discovered again by which all the gods rose up into birth, even by that upward way shouldst thou be born in thy increase; but go not forth by this other to turn thy mother to her fall,\" but if, refusing the upward way, the new spirit in process of birth replies like the god, \"By that way I will not go forth, for it is hard to tread, let me come out straight on the level from thy side; I have many things to do which have not yet been done; with one I must fight and with another I must question after the Truth,\" then the new age may do great things, as the last also did great things, but it will miss the highest way and end like it in a catastrophe. There is no reason why we should so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> our new birth in time; for the spirit and life are not incompatible, but rather a greater power of the spirit brings a greater power of life. Poetry and art most of all our powers can <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to bring this truth home to the mind of man with an illumining and catholic force, for while philosophy may lose itself in abstractions and religion turn to an intolerant otherworldliness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>asceticism</span>, poetry and art are born mediators between the immaterial and the concrete, the spirit and life. This mediation between the truth of the spirit and the truth<span class='page-number' id='s-223' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.223]</span> of life will be one of the chief functions of the poetry of the future.\n\nThe two other sister lamps of God, colour suns of the Ideal, which our age has most dimmed and of whose reviving light it is most sadly in need, but still too strenuously outward and utilitarian to feel sufficiently their absence, Beauty and Delight, are also things spiritual and they bring out the very heart of sweetness and colour and flame of the other three. Truth and Life have not their perfection until they are suffused and filled with the completing power of delight and the fine power of beauty and become one at their heights with this perfecting hue and this secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of themselves; the spirit has no full revelation without these two satisfying presences. For the ancient Indian idea is absolutely true that delight, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, is the inmost expressive and creative nature of the free self because it is the very essence of the original being of the Spirit. But beauty and delight are also the very soul and origin of art and poetry. It is the significance and spiritual function of art and poetry to liberate man into pure delight and to bring beauty into his life. Only there are grades and heights here as in everything else and the highest kinds of delight and beauty are those which are one with the highest Truth, the perfection of life and the purest and fullest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of the self-revealing Spirit. Therefore will poetry most find itself and enter most completely into its heritage when it arrives at the richest harmony of these five things in their most splendid and ample sweetness and light and power; but that can only wholly be when it sings from the highest skies of vision and ranges through the widest widths of our being.\n\nThese powers can indeed be possessed in every scale, because on whatever grade of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> we stand, the Spirit, the divine Self of man is always there, can break out into a strong flame of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> carrying in it all its godheads in whatever form, and poetry and art are among the means by which it thus delivers itself into expression. Therefore the essence of poetry is eternally the same and its essential power and the magnitude of the genius expended may be the same whatever the frame of the sight, whether it be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> chanting of the heroes in god-moved battle<span class='page-number' id='s-224' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.224]</span> before Troy and of Odysseus wandering among the wonders of remote and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> isles with his heart always turned to his lost and far-off human hearth, Shakespeare riding in his surge of the manifold colour and music and passion of life, or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dante</span> errant mid his terrible or beatific visions of Hell and Purgatory and Paradise, or Valmiki singing of the ideal man embodying God and egoistic giant Rakshasa embodying only fierce self-will approaching each other from their different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of life and in their different law of being for the struggle desired by the gods, or some mystic Vamadeva or Vishwamitra voicing in strange vivid now forgotten symbols the action of the gods and the glories of the Truth, the battle and the journey to the Light, the double riches and the sacrificial climbing of the soul to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Immortality</span>. For whether it be the inspired imagination fixed on earth or the soul of life or the inspired reason or the high intuitive spiritual vision which gives the form, the genius of the great poet will seize on some truth of being, some breath of life, some power of the spirit and bring it out with a certain supreme force for his and our delight and joy in its beauty. But nevertheless the poetry which can keep the amplitude of its breadth and nearness of its touch and yet see all things from a higher height will, the rest being equal, give more and will more fully satisfy the whole of what we are and therefore the whole of what we demand from this most complete of all the arts and most subtle of all our means of aesthetic self-expression.\n\nThe poetry of the future, if it fulfils in amplitude the promise now only there in rich hint, will kindle these five lamps of our being, but raise them up more on high and light with them a broader country, many countries indeed now hidden from our view, will make them not any longer lamps in some limited temple of beauty, but suns in the heavens of our highest mind and illuminative of our widest as well as our inmost life. It will be a poetry of a new largest vision of himself and Nature and God and all things which is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> itself to man and of its possible realisation in a nobler and more divine manhood; and it will not sing of them only with the power of the imaginative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, the exalted and ecstatic sense or the moved joy and<span class='page-number' id='s-225' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.225]</span> passion of life, but will rise to look at them from an intenser light and embody them in a more revealing force of the word. It will be first and most a poetry of the intuitive reason, the intuitive senses, the intuitive delight-soul in us, getting from this enhanced source of inspiration a more sovereign poetic enthusiasm and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>, and then, it may even be, rise towards a still greater power of revelation nearer to the direct vision and word of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Overmind</span> from which all creative inspiration comes.\n\nA poetry of this kind need not be at all something high and remote or beautifully and delicately intangible, or not that alone, but will make too the highest things near, close and visible, will sing greatly and beautifully of all that has been sung, all that we are from outward body to very God and Self, of the finite and the infinite, the transient and the Eternal, but with a new reconciling and fusing vision that will make them other to us than they have been even when yet the same. If it wings to the heights, it will not leave earth unseen below it, but also will not confine itself to earth, but find too other realities and their powers on man and take all the planes of existence for its empire. It will take up and transform the secrets of the older poets and find new undiscovered secrets, transfigure the old rhythms by the insistence of the voice of its deeper subtler spirit and create new characteristic harmonies, reveal other greater powers and spirits of language, proceeding from the past and present yet will not be limited by them or their rule and forms and canon, but compass its own altered perfected art of poetry. This at least is its possible ideal endeavour, and then the attempt itself would be a rejuvenating elixir and put the poetic spirit once more in the shining front of the powers and guides of the ever-progressing soul of humanity. There it will lead in the journey like the Vedic Agni, the fiery giver of the word, *yuvā kaviḥ, priyo atithir amartyo mandrajihvo, ṛtacid ṛtāvā*, the Youth, the Seer, the beloved and immortal Guest with his honeyed tongue of ecstasy, the Truth-conscious, the Truth-finder, born as a flame from earth and yet the heavenly messenger of the Immortals.<span class='page-number' id='s-226' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.226]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-ideal-spirit-of-poetry","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Sun of Poetic Truth","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-sun-of-poetic-truth","prvt":"New Birth or Decadence?","prvu":"/cwsa/26/new-birth-or-decadence","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-sun-of-poetic-truth"],"t":"The Sun of Poetic Truth","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"What is the kind of Truth which we can demand from the spirit of poetry, from the lips of the inspired singer, or what do we mean when we speak of Truth as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the high powers and godheads of his work and of its light as a diviner sunlight in which he must see and shape from its burning rays within and around him the flame-stuff of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>?

But first there is the primary objection, plausible enough if we look only at the glowing robe and not at the soul of creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, that the poet has nothing at all to do with any other kind of truth or with Truth at all for her own sake, but is a lover only of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beauty</span>, she his only worshipped goddess, and not truth but imagination her winged servant and the radiant messenger of the Muse.

That might seem at first sight to mean or so might be interpreted that truth and art are two unconnected or little connected things, and if truth is to be made at all the subject matter of art, it yet does not become art unless it has come out transfigured and, it may be, unrecognisable in the imagination's characteristic process. But in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> it does not mean that, but only that art is not an imitation or reproduction of outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, but rather missioned to give by the aid of a transmuting faculty something more inwardly true than the external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and appearance.<span class='page-number' id='s-227' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.227]</span>\n\nAnd next, there is the quite opposite idea, which one finds sometimes rampant and self-confident in an age of realism and the cult of vital power, that the truth which is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> of poetry and has to be set out and rhythmed in her process, is the reality of life in its most strenuous vital sense, the reality of what we see and hear and touch and vitally feel and energetically think with the most positive impact of the mind, the raw rough concrete and dynamic fact of experience to be transferred without any real change into rhythmic form, relieved with image and dressed in its just idea and word. And we are even told that poetry to be faithful to life must manage not only her seeing and expression, but her rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> so as to create some subjective correspondence with life, creep and trip and walk and run and bound along with it, reproduce every bang and stumble and shuffle and thump of the vital steps, and then we shall get a quite new large and vigorous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> and in comparison with its sincere and direct power the old melodies will fade into false and flimsy sweetnesses of insipid artifice. Here what is demanded is not beauty but power or rather <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. If beauty can get in, if she can dress herself in these new and strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span>, we shall gratefully accept her, provided she is not too beautiful to be true and does not bring in again with her the unreal, the romantic or remotely ideal or some novel kind of perverse[^1] imagination. But if ugly, brutal and sordid things are shown powerfully in their full ugliness, brutality and sordidness without any work of transmutation, so much the better since truth of life, force of vital reality of whatever kind set and made vivid in a strong outlining illumination is what we shall henceforth demand of the artist in verse. And it cannot be denied that the crudity of actual life so treated and heightened in art—for art cannot merely reproduce, it cannot <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> heightening—gives us a new sensation, becomes a crude and heady wine setting up an agreeable disturbance in the midriff and bowels and a violent satisfaction in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span><span class='page-number' id='s-228' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.228]</span> and can be given by a powerful writer a wide appeal demanding no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of taste or understanding from the average <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who makes the multitude.

I have not read the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span>, but the expression itself is a sufficient condemnation not of the poet, but of the mind—and of its poetic theory—which can use such a word in such a connection.\n\nThen again there is the old academic conception, truth of the cultivated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, truth of reason, philosophic and scientific truth, or, more pertinent to the matter, truth of a certain selective imagination and taste consonant with reason and strong to give a tempered beauty to just presentation and idea, the classical or in its more formal shape the pseudo-classical aesthetic rule. And in this connection we have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> familiar notions chasing each other across the field, such as on one side the compatibility or incompatibility of philosophy and poetry or on the other the definition of poetry as substantially a criticism of life though set in an artistic form and a high and serious tone. And associated with this view also we find very commonly a dislike of free imagination and rich colour and the audacities of the fancy and the far-off and shrouded voices and things visionary, subtle and remote. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span> varies, follows its own bent, fashions its idea of poetic truth according to its own standard of satisfaction and sets up as a canon and law its own manner of response; there is a multitude of counsels, and each has this common characteristic that it overstresses one side of the norm of poetic creation. For the spirit of poetry is many-sided and flexible in its processes, but firm and invariable in the central law of its nature.\n\nThe poetic Truth of which I am speaking has nothing to do with any of these limitations. Truth, as she is seen by us in the end, is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> goddess, the very front and face of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinity</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aditi</span> herself, the illimitable mother of all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>. This infinite, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> and eternally creative Truth is no enemy of imagination or even of free fancy, for they too are godheads and can wear one of her faces or one of her expressive masks, while imagination is perhaps the very colour of her creative process, her births and movements are innumerable, her walk supple and many-pathed, and through all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> powers and universal<span class='page-number' id='s-229' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.229]</span> means she can find her way to her own riches, and even error is her illegitimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> and serves, though wantonly, rebelliously and through many a giddy turn, her mother's many-formed self-adaptive world-wide aim. Now it is something of this infinite Truth which poetry succeeds in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> us with a high power, in its own way of beauty, by its own opulent appointed means. The channel is different from those of her other activities because the power is of another kind. Infinite Truth has her many distinct ways of expressing and finding herself and each way must be kept distinct and the law of one must not be applied to the law of another form of her self-expression; and yet that does not mean that the material of one cannot be used as the material of another, though it must be cast by a different power into a different mould, or that all do not meet on their tops. Truth of poetry is not truth of philosophy or truth of science or truth of religion only, because it is another way of self-expression of infinite Truth so distinct that it appears to give quite another face of things and reveal quite another side of experience. A poet may have a religious creed or subscribe to a system of philosophy or take rank himself like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lucretius</span> or certain Indian poets as a considerable philosophical thinker or succeed like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goethe</span> as a scientist as well as a poetic creator, but the moment he begins to argue out his system intellectually in verse or puts a dressedup science straight into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> or else inflicts like Wordsworth or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span> rhymed sermons or theological disputations on us, he is breaking the law. And even if he does not move so far astray, yet the farther he goes in that direction even within the bounds of his art, he is, though it has often been done with a tolerable, sometimes a considerable or total success, treading on unfirm or at any rate on lower ground. It is difficult for him there to maintain the authentic poetic spirit and pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>.\n\nFor this is another cult and worship and the moment he stands before the altar of the Muse, he has to change his robes of mind and serve the rites of a different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span>. He has to bring out into the front that other personality in him who looks with a more richly irised seeing eye and speaks with a more rapturous voice. The others have not normally the same<span class='page-number' id='s-230' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.230]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of the word because they do not go to its fountain-head, even though each has its own intense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>, as philosophy has its joy of deep and comprehensive understanding and religion its hardly expressible rapture. Still it remains true that the poet may express precisely the same thing in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> as the philosopher or the man of religion or the man of science, may even give us truth of philosophy, truth of religion, truth of science, provided he transmutes it, abstracts from it something on which the others insist in their own special form and gives us the something more which poetic sight and expression bring. He has to convert it into truth of poetry, and it will be still better for his art if he saw it originally with the poetic insight, the creative, intuitive, directly perceiving and interpreting eye; for then his utterance of truth is likely to be more poetic, authentic, inspired and compelling. This distinction between poetic and other truth, well enough felt but not always well observed, and their fusion and meeting-place are worth dwelling upon; for if poetry is to do all it can for us in the new age, it will include increasingly in its scope much that will be common to it with philosophy, religion and even in a broader sense with science, and yet it will at the same time develop more intensely the special beauty and peculiar power of its own insight and its own manner. The poetry of Tagore is already a new striking instance of what differently seen and followed out might have been a specifically philosophic and religious truth, but here turned into beauty and given a new significance by the transforming power of poetic vision.\n\nThe difference which separates these great things of the mind is a difference of the principal, the indispensable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> we must use and of the appeal to the mind and the whole manner. There is a whole gulf of difference. The philosopher sees in the dry light of the reason, proceeds dispassionately by a severe analysis and abstraction of the intellectual content of the truth, a logical slow close stepping from idea to pure idea, a method difficult and nebulous to the ordinary, hard, arid, impossible to the poetic mind. For the poetic mind sees at once in a flood of coloured light, in a moved experience, in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of the coming of the word, in splendours of form, in a spontaneous<span class='page-number' id='s-231' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.231]</span> leaping out of inspired idea upon idea, sparks of the hoof-beats of the white flame horse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dadhikravan</span> galloping up the mountain of the gods or breath and hue of wing striking into wing of the irised broods of Thought flying over earth or up towards heaven. The scientist proceeds also by the intellectual reason but with a microscopic scrutiny which brings it to bear on an analysis of sensible fact and process and on the correct measure and relation of force and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> as it is seen working on the phenomenal stuff of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, and joins continually link of fact with fact and coil of process with process till he has under his hand at least in skeleton and tissue the whole connected chain of apparent things. But to the poetic mind this is a dead mechanical thing; for the eye of the poet loves to look on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>breathing</span> acting life in its perfected synthesis and rhythm, not on the constituent measures, still less on the dissected parts, and his look seizes the soul of wonder of things, not the mechanical miracle. The method of these other powers moves by the rigorously based and patiently self-assured steps of the systematising intelligence and the aspect of Truth which they uncover is a norm measured and cut out from the world of ideas and the world of sense by the eye of the intellectual reason. The brooding philosopher or the discovering scientist cannot indeed do without the aid of a greater power, intuition, but ordinarily he has to bring what that nearer more swiftly luminous faculty gives him into a more deliberate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> under the critical light of the intelligence and establish it in the dialectical or analytical way of philosophy and science before the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> as judge. The mind of the poet sees by intuition and direct perception and brings out what they give him by a formative stress on the total image, and the aspect to which he thrills is the living truth of the form, of the life that inspires it, of the creative thought behind and the supporting movement of the soul and a rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of these things revealed to his delight in their beauty. These fields and paths lie very wide apart, and if any voices from the others reach and claim the ear of the poetic creator, they must change greatly in their form and suit themselves to the warmth and colour of his atmosphere before they can find right of entry into his kingdom.<span class='page-number' id='s-232' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.232]</span>\n\nThe meeting is not here at the base, but on the tops. The philosopher's reasoning intelligence discovers only a system of thought symbols and the reality they figure cannot be seized by the intelligence, but needs direct intuition, a living contact, a close experience by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> in our self of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>. That is work not for a dialectical, but a bright revelatory thinking, a luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of intuitive thought and spiritual experience which carries us straight into sight, into vision of knowledge. The first effort of philosophy is to know for the sake of pure understanding, but her greater height is to take Truth alive in the spirit and clasp and grow one with her and be consciously within ourselves all the reality we have learned to know. But that is precisely what the poet strives to do in his own way by intuition and imagination, when he labours to bring himself close to and be one by delight with the thing of beauty which awakes his joy. He does not always seize the very self of the thing, but to do so lies within his power. The language of intuitive thinking moves always therefore to an affinity with poetic speech and in the ancient Upanishads it used that commonly as its natural vehicle. \"The Spirit went abroad, a thing pure, bright, unwounded by sin, without body or sinew or scar; the Seer, the Thinker, the Self-born who breaks into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> all around us, decreed of old all things in their nature from long eternal years.\" \"There sun shines not nor moon nor star nor these lightnings blaze nor this fire; all this world is luminous only with his light.\" Are we listening, one might ask, to the voice of poetry or philosophy or religion? It is all three voices cast in one, indistinguishable in the eternal choir. And there is too and similarly a pure intuitive science which comes into the field when we enter the ranges of the psychical and spiritual being and can from there work for the discovery of greater secrets of the physical or at least of the psycho-physical world. Indian Yoga founds itself on that greater process, and there, though as in all true science the object is an assured method of personal discovery or living repetition and possession of past discovery and a working out of all the thing found, there is too a high final intention to hold the truth, the light found in our inner power of being and turn it to a power of<span class='page-number' id='s-233' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.233]</span> our psychical self, our spirit, our self of knowledge and will, our self of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and joy, our self of life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. This too, though not the same thing in form, is akin to the higher work of poetry when it acts, as the ancients would have had it consciously act, as a purifier and builder of the soul.\n\nThe initial function of religion again is to make clear the approaches of the soul to the Highest, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>. And it does that at first by laying on the mind a scheme of religious knowledge or guiding creed and dogma, a taming yoke of moral instruction or purifying law of religious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> and an awakening <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> of religious emotion, worship, cult, and so far it is a thing apart in its own field, but in its truly revealing side of intuitive being and experience we find that the essence of religion is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> of the soul towards the Divine, the Self, the Supreme, the Eternal, the Infinite, and an effort to get close to and live with or in that or to enjoy in love and be like or one with that which we adore. But poetry also on its heights turns to the same things in ourselves and the world, not indeed with religious adoration, but by a regarding closeness and moved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> in beauty and delight. The characteristic method and first field of all these things is indeed wide apart, but at their end when they come into their deepest spirit, they begin to approach each other and touch; and because of this greater affinity philosophy, psychic and spiritual science and religion are found in the ancient Indian culture woven into one unity, and when they turn to the expression of their most intimate experience, it is always the poetic word which they use.\n\nThe steps of Poetry rise to these heights on her own side of the mountain of the gods. Poetry comes into being at the direct call of three powers, inspiration, beauty and delight, and brings them to us and us to them by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> charm of the inspired rhythmic word. If it can do that at all perfectly, its essential work has been done. It is in its beginning concerned with close and simple natural things and, when it grows more subtle, still it has only to create a power of beauty, move the soul with aesthetic delight and make it feel and see, and its function seems at an end. The kind does not seem to matter, and it has nothing to do<span class='page-number' id='s-234' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.234]</span> primarily or directly, nor at any time in a set formal will taking that as its function and aim, with the presentation of intellectual concepts to the reason or with truth of science or with moral betterment or the working out of religious aspiration, not often even with so near a thing to it as religious emotion and love. But yet because of that greater affinity we see it actually doing what is an equivalent to these things by its own power, in a strange and beautiful mould, with an indirect and yet subtly direct touch. The poet too brings out sometimes as if by accident, sometimes with a conscious intention the same essential truths as the philosopher or the man of religion. An instance or two will be sufficient to show the approximation and the difference. Religion brings us a command to love our neighbour as ourselves and even our enemies, a thing impossible to our normal nature, a law honoured with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> of the lips and universally ignored in the observance. A few only seeking perfection in spiritual experience discover in it the natural rule of our real and our highest being, quite possible if we can only get some abiding realisation of that secret oneness which is the foundation of the law of universal love. Then, not seeking this at all but only poetic delight or, if you are so inclined, the criticism of life, we listen to Creon's fierce reproach to Antigone that in her refusal to hate the national enemy she stands unnaturally apart from the mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of all her people and hear suddenly start out the high and proud reply of one lonely and doomed but inflexibly true to her nature, her soul's will under the shadow of a cruel <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, \"Not to join in hate, but to join in love was I born!\" The Athenian poet intended no moral instruction, calls up no religious emotion into his line, is concerned only with a crucial situation in life, the revolt of natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> against the rigid claim of the law, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, State. It is a simple cry of the voice of nature and life, yet there breathes behind it a greater thought which is not so far from the truth underlying religious teaching and spiritual experience. The poet, his eyes fixed on life, shows us as if by accident the seed in our normal nature which can grow into the prodigious spiritual truth of universal love. He has to do it in his own way in the mould of poetic<span class='page-number' id='s-235' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.235]</span> beauty and delight, and if we judge by such instances, we shall say that so only he has to do it, to cast as if casually the seed of the beauty and delight of some high mood of life and nature into the mind and pass on leaving it to its work on the soul's reflecting emotional experience, perhaps hardly himself knowing what he has done since he is absorbed in sight and satisfied with the joy of beautiful creation.\n\nAnd yet actually we find that we cannot quite set these limits or they are not regarded by poets of a high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>. The poet of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> has the conscious intention of laying the form of unity on the soul of the hearer and moving him to seek the full experience. \"He is the greatest Yogin who, come <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> by that or come <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, sees wherever he turns his eyes all equally in the image of his self.\" That is something high, grave, couched in the language of the inspired reason, uplifted in the original by a sweet and noble diction and rhythm, religious and philosophical in its strain and yet poetical, because it adds to the fundamental idea the visualising and bringing home of the spiritual experience, the sustaining emotion of the thing felt and a touch of its life. And in the much older Yajur Veda we find breaking out with a different, a more moved and less reflective voice the same truth of experience, the same touch on the soul, \"Where I am wounded, make me firm and whole. May all creatures gaze on me with the eye of the Friend, may I gaze on all creatures, may we all gaze on all with the eye of the Friend.\" There poetry and religious emotion become powerfully fused and one in the aspiration to the heart's perfection and the loving unity of all life. The same uniting alchemy and fusion can take place between truth of philosophy and poetic truth and it is continually found in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span></span>. And so too all the old Rig Veda, all the Vaishnava poetry of North and South had behind it an elaborate Yoga or practised psychical and spiritual science, without which it could not have come into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> in that form. Today much of the poetry of Tagore is the sign of such a Sadhana, a long inheritance of assured spiritual discovery and experience. But what is given whether directly or in symbol or in poetic image is not the formal steps of the Sadhana, but<span class='page-number' id='s-236' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.236]</span> the strongly felt movement and the living outcome, the vision and life and inner experience, the spirit and power and body of sweetness and beauty and delight. The tracing of close and too meticulous bounds round the steps of poetic truth or turning of its wide continental spheres into some limiting magic circle seems therefore to have no real foundation. One may almost though not quite say that there is nothing in infinite Truth that the poet cannot make his material, even if it seems to belong to other provinces of the mind, because all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of human experience approach each other on their sides of intuition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and vision and all meet in the spirit. The condition, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> is only in the way and manner,—but that means enormously much,—the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of the purely poetic way of seeing and the subjection of the thing seen to the law of poetic harmony and moved delight and beauty.\n\nThe real distinction therefore is in the primary or essential aim of poetry and in the imperative condition which that aim lays upon the art. Its function is not to teach truth of any particular kind, nor indeed to teach at all, nor to pursue knowledge nor to serve any religious or ethical aim, but to embody beauty in the word and give delight. But at the same time it is at any rate part of its highest function to serve the spirit and to illumine and lead through beauty and build by a high informing and revealing delight the soul of man. And its field is all soul experience, its appeal is to the aesthetic response of the soul to all that touches it in self or world; it is one of the high and beautiful powers of our inner and may be a power of our inmost life. All of the infinite Truth of being that can be made part of that life, all that can be made true and beautiful and living to that experience, is poetic truth and a fit subject matter of poetry. But there are always three things which we find present in the utterance and which may be taken as the tests of its measure of power. First there is a force of inspired seeing which gives us the appeal of some reality of self or mind or world, whether in this material field or the other planes of universal existence or of our own being to which imagination is one of the gates, a seeing which brings to us the power of its truth and the beauty of its image<span class='page-number' id='s-237' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.237]</span> and gives it body in the mind by the word. Then there must be the touch, presence, breath of the very life, not the outward only, but the inward life, not an imitation by force of speech or the holding up of a mirror to some external movement or form of Nature, but a creative interpretation which brings home to us as much as may be of what she is or things or we are. And again that must carry in it and arouse in us an emotion of its touch on the soul, not the raw emotion of the vital parts,—though that comes in in certain kinds of poetry,—but a spiritual essence of feeling to which our inner strands can vibrate. The intellectual, vital, sensible truths are subordinate things; the breath of poetry should give us along with them, or it may even be apart from them, some more essential truth of the being of things, their very power which springs in the last resort from something eternal in their heart and secrecy, *hṛdaye guhāyām*, expressive even in the moments and transiences of life. The soul of the poet, and the soul too of the hearer by a response to his word, enters into some direct contact through vision and straight touch and emotion, possesses and feels at its strongest by a union in our own stuff of being, a moved identity. A direct spiritual perception and vision called by us intuition, however helped or prepared by other powers, can alone avail to give us these things. Imagination is only the poet's most powerful aid for this discovery and interpretative creation, fancy a brilliant opener of hidden or out-of-the-way doors. The finding of a new image is itself a joy to the poet and the hearer because it reveals some new significant correspondence or sheds a stronger disclosing light on the thing seen and makes it stand out and live more opulently, luminously, with a greater delight of itself in the mind. The poet having to bring home something, even in things common, which is not obvious to surface experience, avails himself of image, symbol, whatever is just, beautiful, meaningful, suggestive. His fictions are not charming airy nothings, but as with every true artist significant figures and creations which serve to bring very real realities close to the spirit, and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> is the immortality of truth.\n\nIt is in this sense that we can speak of the sun of poetic truth<span class='page-number' id='s-238' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.238]</span> in whose universal light the poet creates. But all depends on how he sees or uses the light. He can catch this or that sight in an isolated ray, or sometimes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> with it his own personality and kindles a lamp in the house of his own being, or looks through its radiance over the material earth and the forms and first movements of her children or searches with the lustre the surge of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> and its passion and power or discovers the lesser or the greater secrets of the mind and heart of man, or looks upwards through a loftier flood of beams and sees the midworlds and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> and the actions of the gods and the scenes and moments of an immortal life. And sometimes the dark sun of the Vedic image lodging in the blind cave gives him a negative light; a darkness visible revealing darkness immeasurable shows him the gloomy secrets of some city of dreadful Night, shadow of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hades</span> or lowest Tartarean clot of Hell. The sun of Truth may be still for him below the verge with its light already on the tops and flushing the chill of the snows, ride regal in heaven or gravely sunken or splendid in some setting light. He may stand on the earth or wander winged like the symbolic birds of the Veda still in the terrestrial atmosphere or rise into worlds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> nearer to the sun and see in a changed light all that is below. And one or two may perhaps be strong to look with unblinded eyes into the source of all light, see that splendour which is its happiest form of all, to which approaching or entering one can say \"He am I\", discover the identity of his spirit with all things and find in that oneness the word of light which can most powerfully illumine our human utterance.\n\nAnd where then is the highest range of sight into which the mind of the poet can rise and according to the power of his genius find a deeper and deeper and larger and larger truth of already spoken things and of new things to be spoken and as yet unattempted in prose or rhyme? If some kind of intuitive seeing is at the back of his imaginative vision and the real power that calls down the inspired word, it will be when he can rise to its source and live in the fullness of a highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> which is greater than the awakened sense, intuitive life-vision or inspired reason, though it will see all that they can see, that<span class='page-number' id='s-239' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.239]</span> he will get his fullest power, deepest sight, broadest scope. To throw light on the self of things in some power and beauty of it is after all the native aim of poetry, and that can be done entirely by this greatest intuitive mind, for it can bring near or going beyond itself actually reach the vision of identity, that seeing of our whole self and the self of the world which is the last object and the highest spirit of all our mental powers and seekings. The poetry which will accomplish that will be able to see, though in another way than that of philosophy and religion, the self of the Eternal, to know God and his godheads, to know the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and immortality which is our divinest aim, to see in the delight of a union in beauty the self of the Infinite, the self of Nature and the whole self of man. But so to see the self is to meet the spirit in everything and the spirit reveals to us the inner and the inmost truth of all that comes from it, life and thought and form and every image and every power. Much has been done by the art of rhythmic self-expression; much remains to be done. To express these greatest things and to gather up all that man has come and is yet coming to see and know and feel in a new and greater light and give to him the universal spirit and power of beauty and delight behind all this existence is a work that will open to poetry a larger territory and the perfect greatness of its function. A beginning of such an endeavour we have seen to be the noblest strain in recent work; the possibility of a refreshed and long continued vitality and a hardly exhaustible fount of inspiration lies in that direction. The Veda speaks in one of its symbolic hints of the fountain of eternal Truth round which stand the illumined powers of thought and life. There under the eyes of delight and the face of imperishable beauty of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> of creation and bride of the eternal Spirit they lead their immortal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dance</span>. The poet visits that marvellous source in his superconscient mind and brings to us some strain or some vision of her face and works. To find the way into that circle with the waking self is to be the seer-poet and discover the highest power of the inspired word, the Mantra.<span class='page-number' id='s-240' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.240]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-sun-of-poetic-truth","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Breath of Greater Life","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-breath-of-greater-life","prvt":"The Ideal Spirit of Poetry","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-ideal-spirit-of-poetry","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-breath-of-greater-life"],"t":"The Breath of Greater Life","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The turn of poetry in the age which we have now left behind, was, as was inevitable in a reign of dominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span>, a preoccupation with reflective thought and therefore with truth, but it was not at its core and in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> a poetic thought and truth and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, however artistically dressed with image and turn or enforced by strong or dexterous phrase, however frequently searching, apt or picturesque, had not often, except in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> or two exceptional voices, the most moving and intimate tones of poetry.

The few poets who strained towards a nearer hold upon life, had to struggle against this atmosphere which weighed upon their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and clogged their breath. Whitman, striving by stress of thought towards a greater truth of the soul and life, found refuge in a revolutionary breaking out into new anarchic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, a vindication of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which unfortunately at its ordinary levels brings us nearer to the earth and not higher up towards a more illumined air; Swinburne, excited by the lyric fire within him, had too<span class='page-number' id='s-241' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.241]</span> often to lash himself into a strained violence of passion in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to make a way through the clogging thickness for its rush of sound; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Meredith</span>'s strains, hymning life in a word burdened and packed with thought, are strong and intimate, but difficult and few. And therefore in this epoch of a bursting into new fields and seeking for new finer and bolder impulses of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, one of the most insistent demands and needs of the human mind, not only in poetry, but in thought itself and in spirit, has been to lessen the tyranny of the reasoning and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>critical intellect</span>, to return to the power and sincerity of life and come by a greater deepness of the intuition of its soul of meaning. That is the most striking turn of all recent writing of any importance.\n\nThis turn is in itself perfectly sound and its direction is to a certain extent on the right line, even if it does not yet altogether see its own end. But the firm grasp on a greater life has not quite come and there are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> mistaken directions of this urge. The enlightening power of the poet's creation is vision of truth, its moving power is a passion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>, but its sustaining power and that which makes it great and vital is the breath of life. A poetry which is all thought and no life or a thought which does not constantly keep in touch with and refresh itself from the fountains of life, even if it is something more than a strong, elegant or cultured philosophising or moralising in skilled verse, even if it has vision and intellectual beauty, suffers always by lack of fire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, wants perfection of grasp and does not take full hold on the inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> to seize and uplift as well as sweeten and illumine, as poetry should do and all great poetic writing does. The function of the poet even when he is most absorbed in thinking, is still to bring out not merely the truth and interest, but the beauty and power of the thought, its life and emotion, and not only to do that, not only to make the thought a beautiful and living thing, but to make it one thing with life. But words are ambiguous things and we must see what is the full extent of our meaning when we say, as we may say, that the poet's first concern and his concern always is with living beauty and reality, with life.\n\nAs we can say that the truth with which poetry is touched,<span class='page-number' id='s-242' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.242]</span> is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> truth, all the truth that lives in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> and universal and fills, informs, vivifies, holds and shapes the spirit and form of creation, so we may say too that the life, something of which the poet has to reembody in the beauty of the word, is all life, the infinite life of the spirit thrown out in its many creations. The poet's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> most really, most intimately is not with the outward physical life as it is or the life of the passions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> only for its own sake or even with some ideal life imaged by the mind or some combining and new shaping of these things into a form of beauty, but with the life of the soul and with these other things only as its expressive forms. Poetry is the rhythmic voice of life, but it is one of the inner and not one of the surface voices. And the more of this inner truth of his function the poet brings out in his work, the greater is his creation, while it does not seem to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> essentially or not at the first whether his method is professedly subjective or objective, his ostensible power that of a more outward or a more inward spirit or whether it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> soul or the soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> or the eternal and universal spirit in them whose beauty and living reality find expression in his word. This universal truth of poetry is apt to be a little hidden from us by the form and stress of preoccupation with this or that medium of outward soul-expression in the poet's work. Mankind in its development seems to begin with the most outward things and go always more and more inward in order that the race may mount to greater heights of the spirit's life. An early poetry therefore is much occupied with a simple, natural, straightforward, external presentation of life. A primitive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> bard like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> thinks only by the way and seems to be carried constantly forward in the stream of his strenuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and to cast out as he goes only so much of surface thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and feeling as obviously emerges in a strong and single and natural speech and action. And yet it is the adventures and trials and strength and courage of the soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> in Odysseus which makes the greatness of the Odyssey and not merely the vivid incident and picturesque surrounding circumstance, and it is the clash of great and strong spirits with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> leaning<span class='page-number' id='s-243' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.243]</span> down to participate in their struggle which makes the greatness of the Iliad and not merely the action and stir of battle. The outward form of Shakespeare's work is a surge of emotion and passion and thought and act and event arising out of character at ferment in the yeast of feeling and passion, but it is its living interpretation of the truth and powers of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> of man that are the core of greatness of his work and the rest without it would be a vain brute turmoil. The absence or defect of this greater element makes indeed the immense inferiority of the rest of Elizabethan dramatic work. And whatever the outward character or form of the poetry, the same law holds that poetry is a self-expressive power of the spirit and where the soul of things is most revealed in its very life by the rhythmic word, there is the fullest achievement of the poet's function.\n\nAnd so long as the poet's medium is the outward life of things or the surface inward life of the passions and emotions, he is moving in a strong and fresh natural element and in an undivided wholeness of the inner and outer man, and his work, given the native power in him, has all the vitality of a thing fully felt and lived. But when intellectual thought has begun its reign in the mind of a more cultured race, the poet's difficulty also begins and increases as that reign becomes more sovereign and imperative. For intellectual thought makes a sort of scission in our being and on one side of the line is the vital urge carrying on life and on the other side the deliberate detached reason trying to observe it, take an intelligent view and extract from it all its thought values. The poet, as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> of the age and one of its voices, is moved to follow this turn. He too observes life, extracts the thought values of his theme, criticises while attempting to create, or even lingers to analyse his living subject, as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Browning</span> is constantly doing with the thinking and feeling mind of his characters. But this can only be done without detriment to the vital power of the poetic spirit and the all-seizing effect of its word, when there is a balance maintained between thought and life, the life passing into self-observing thought and the thought returning on the life to shape it in its own vital image. It has been remarked that the just balance between thought and the living<span class='page-number' id='s-244' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.244]</span> word was found by the Greeks and not again. That is perhaps an excessive affirmation, but certainly a just balance between observing thought and life is the distinctive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of classical poetry and that endeavour gave it its stamp whether in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Athens</span> or Rome or in much of the epic or classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> of ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. But this balance is easily lost, a difficult thing, and, once it has gone, thought begins to overweight life which loses its power and élan and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>, its vigorous natural body and its sincere and satisfied passion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. We get more of studies of life than of creation, thought about the meaning of character and emotion and event and elaborate description rather than the living presence of these things. Passion, direct feeling, ardent emotion, sincerity of sensuous joy are chilled by the observing eye of the reason and give place to a play of sentiment,—sentiment which is an indulgence of the intelligent observing mind in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthesis</span>, the *rasa* of feeling, passion, emotion, sense thinning them away into a subtle, at the end almost unreal fineness. There is then an attempt to get back to the natural fullness of the vital and physical life, but the endeavour fails in sincerity and success because it is impossible; the mind of man having got so far cannot return upon its course, undo what it has made of itself and recover the glad childhood of its early vigorous nature. There is instead of the simplicity of spontaneous life a search after things striking, exaggerated, abnormal, violent, new, in the end a morbid fastening on perversities, on all that is ugly, glaring and coarse on the plea of their greater reality, on exaggerations of vital instinct and sensation, on physical wrynesses and crudities and things unhealthily strange. The thought-mind, losing the natural full-blooded power of the vital being, pores on these things, stimulates the failing blood with them and gives itself an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of some forceful sensation of living. This is not the real issue, but the way to exhaustion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span>.\n\nThe demand for life, for action, the tendency to a pragmatic and vitalistic view of things, a certain strenuous and even strident note has been loud enough in recent years. Life, action, vital power are great indispensable things, but to get back to them by thinking less is a way not open to us in this age of time, even if<span class='page-number' id='s-245' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.245]</span> it were a desirable remedy for our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> of over-intellectuality and a mechanised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> we do not think less than the men of the past generation but much more insistently, with a more packed and teeming thought, with a more eager more absorbed hunting of the mind along all the royal high-roads and alluring byways of life. And it could not be otherwise. The very school of poetry which insists on actual life as the subject matter of the poet carries into it with or without conscious intention the straining of the thought mind after something quite other than the obvious sense of the things it tries to force into relief, some significance deeper than what either the observing reason or the normal life-sense gives to our first or our second view of existence. The way out lies not in cessation of thinking and the turn to a strenuous description of life, nor even in a more vitally forceful thinking, but in another kind of thought mind. The filled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of the thinking mind is as much part of life as that of the body and vital and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional being</span>, and its growth and predominance are a necessary stage of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human progress</span> and man's self-evolution. To go back from it is impossible or, if possible, would be undesirable, a lapse and not a betterment of our spirit. But the full thought-life does not come by the activity of the intellectual reason and its predominance. That is only a step by which we get above the first immersion in the activity and excitement and vigour of the life and the body and give ourselves a first freedom to turn to a greater and higher reach of the fullness of existence. And that higher reach we gain when we get above the limited crude physical mind, above the vital power and its forceful thought and self-vision, above the intellect and its pondering and measuring reason, and tread the illumined realm of an intuitive and spiritual thinking, an intuitive feeling, sense and vision. This is not that vital intuition which is sometimes confused with a much broader, loftier, vaster and more seeing power, but the high original power itself, a supra-intellectual and spiritual intuition. The all-informing spirit, when found in all its fullness, heals the scission between thought and life, the need of a just balance between them disappears, instead there begins a new and luminous and joyful fusion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. The<span class='page-number' id='s-246' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.246]</span> spirit gives us not only a greater light of truth and vision, but the breath of a greater living; for the spirit is not only the self of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, but the great self of life. To find our self and the self of things is not to go through a rarefied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> of thought into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>, but to discover the whole greatest integral power of our complete existence.\n\nThis need is the sufficient reason for attaching the greatest importance to those poets in whom there is the double seeking of this twofold power, the truth and reality of the eternal self and spirit in man and things and the insistence on life. All the most significant and vital work in recent poetry has borne this stamp; the rest is of the hour, but this is of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. It is the highest note of Whitman; in him, as in one who seeks and sees much but has not fully found, it widens the sweep of a great pioneer poetry, but is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of a new view rather than a living in its accomplished fullness; it is constantly repeated from the earth side in Meredith, comes down from the spiritual side in all A. E.'s work, moves between earth and the life of the worlds behind in Yeats' subtle rhythmic voices of vision and beauty, echoes with a large fullness in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carpenter</span>. The poetry of Tagore owes its sudden and universal success to this advantage that he gives us more of this discovery and fusion for which the mind of our age is in quest than any other creative writer of the time. His work is a constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> of the overpassing of the borders, a chant-filled realm in which the subtle sounds and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> of the truth of the spirit give new meanings to the finer subtleties of life. The objection has been made that this poetry is too subtle, too remote, goes too far away from the broad, near, present and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>actualities</span> of terrestrial existence. Yeats is considered by some a poet of Celtic romance and nothing more, Tagore accused in his own country of an unsubstantial poetic philosophising, a lack of actuality, of reality of touch and force of vital insistence. But this is to mistake the work of this poetry and to mistake too in a great measure the sense of life as it must reveal itself to the greatening mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> now that that mind is growing in world-knowledge and towards self-knowledge. These poets have not indeed done all that has to be done or given the complete<span class='page-number' id='s-247' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.247]</span> poetic synthesis and fusion. Their work has been to create a new and deeper manner of seeing life, to build <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bridges</span> of visioned light and rhythm between the infinite and eternal and the limited mind and soul and embodied life of man. The future poetry has not to stay in their achievement; it has yet to step from these first fields into new and yet greater ranges, to fathom all the depths yet unplumbed, to complete what has been left half done or not yet done, to bring all it can of the power of man's greater self and the universal spirit into a broader and even the broadest possible all of life. That cannot and will not be achieved in its fullness at once, but to make a foundation of this new infinite range of poetic vision and creation is work enough to give greatness to a whole age.\n\nThe demand for activity and realism or for a direct, exact and forceful presentation of life in poetry proceeds upon a false sense of what poetry gives or can give us. All the highest activities of the mind of man deal with things other than the crude actuality or the direct appearance or the first rough appeal of existence. A critical or a scientific thought may attempt to give an account of the actuality as it really is, though even to do that they have to go far behind its frontage and make a mental reconstruction and surprising change in its appearance. But the creative powers cannot stop there, but have to make new things for us as well as to make existing things new to the mind and eye. It is no real portion of the function of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> to cut out palpitating pieces from life and present them raw and smoking or well-cooked for the aesthetic digestion. For in the first place all art has to give us beauty and the crude actuality of life is not often beautiful, and in the second place poetry has to give us a deeper reality of things and the outsides and surface faces of life are only a part of its reality and do not take us either very deep or very far. Moreover, the poet's greatest work is to open to us new realms of vision, new realms of being, our own and the world's, and he does this even when he is dealing with actual things. Homer with all his epic vigour of outward presentation does not show us the heroes and deeds before Troy in their actuality as they really were to the normal vision of men, but much rather as they were or might<span class='page-number' id='s-248' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.248]</span> have been to the vision of the gods. Shakespeare's greatness lies not in his reproduction of actual human events or men as they appear to us buttoned and cloaked in life,—others of his time could have done that as well, if with less radiant force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>, yet with more of the realistic crude colour or humdrum drab of daily truth,—but in his bringing out in his characters and themes of things essential, intimate, eternal, universal in man and Nature and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span> on which the outward features are borne as fringe and robe and which belong to all times, but are least obvious to the moment's experience: when we do see them, life presents to us another face and becomes something deeper than its actual present mask. That is why the poet oftenest instinctively prefers to go away from the obsession of a petty actuality, from the realism of the prose of life to his inner creative self or an imaginative background of the past or the lucent air of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>myth</span> or dream or on into a greater outlook on the future. Poetry may indeed deal with the present living scene, at some peril, or even with the social or other questions and problems of the day,—a task which is now often laid on the creative mind, as if that were its proper work; but it does that successfully only when it makes as little as possible of what belongs to the moment and time and the surface and brings out their roots of universal or eternal interest or their suggestion of great and deep things. What the poet borrows from the moment, is the most perishable part of his work and lives at all only by being subordinated and put into intimate relation with less transient realities. And this is so because it is the eternal increasing soul of man and the intimate self of things and their more abiding and significant forms which are the real object of his vision.\n\nThe poetry of the future can least afford to chain itself to the outward actualities which we too often mistake for the whole of life, because it will be the voice of a human mind which is pressing more and more towards the very self of the self of things, the very spirit of which the soul of man is a living power and to a vision of unity and totality which is bound to take note of all that lies behind our apparent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> life</span>. What man sees and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and himself and his race and Nature<span class='page-number' id='s-249' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.249]</span> and the spiritual, mental, psychic and material worlds in which he moves, his backlook upon the past, his sweep of vision over the present, his eye of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and prophecy cast towards the future, his passion of self-finding and self-exceeding, his reach <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the three times to the eternal and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span>, this is his real life. Poetry in the past wrote much of the godheads and powers behind existence, but in the mask of legends and myths, sometimes of God, but not often with a living experience, oftener in the set forms taught by religions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>churches</span> and without true beauty and knowledge. But now the mind of man is opening more largely to the deepest truth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span>, the Self, the Spirit, the eternal Presence not separate and distant, but near us, around us and in us, the Spirit in the world, the greater Self in man and his kind, the Spirit in all that is and lives, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span>, the Existence, the Power, the Beauty, the eternal Delight that broods over all, supports all and manifests itself in every turn of creation. A poetry which lives in this vision must give us quite a new presentation and interpretation of life; for of itself and at the first touch this seeing reconstructs and reimages the world for us and gives us a greater sense and a vaster, subtler and profounder form of our existence. The real faces of the gods are growing more apparent to the eye of the mind, though not yet again intimate with our life, and the forms of legend and symbol and myth must open to other and deeper meanings, as already they have begun to do, and come in changed and vital again into poetry to interpret the realities behind the veil. Nature wears already to our eye a greater and more transparent robe of her divine and her animal and her terrestrial and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> life and a deeper poetry of Nature than has yet been written is one of the certain potentialities of the future. The material realm too cannot for very much longer be our sole or separate world of experience, for the partitions which divide it from psychic and other kingdoms behind it are wearing thin and voices and presences are beginning to break through and reveal their impact on our world. This too must widen our conception of life and make a new world and atmosphere for poetry which may justify as perhaps never before the poet's refusal to regard as unreal<span class='page-number' id='s-250' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.250]</span> what to the normal mind was only romance, illusion or dream. A larger field of being made more real to man's experience will be the realm of the future poetry.\n\nThese things are often given an appearance of remoteness, of withdrawal from the actuality of life, because to discover them the mind had at first to draw away from the insistent outward preoccupation and live as if in a separate world. The seeker of the Self and Spirit, the God-lover, tended to become the cloistered monk, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span>, the eremite and to set the spiritual apart from and against the material life. The lover of Nature went away from the noise of man and daily things to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commune</span> with her largeness and peace. The gods were found more in the lights of solitude than in the thoughts and actions of men. The seer of other worlds lived surrounded by the voices and faces of supernature. And this was a legitimate seclusion, for these are provinces and realms and presences and one has often to wander apart in them or live secluded with them to know their nearest intimacies. The spirit is real in itself even apart from the world, the gods have their own home beyond our sky and air, Nature her own self-absorbed life and supernature its brilliant curtains and its dim mysterious fences. None of these things are unreal, and if the supernatural as handled by older poets seemed often mere legend, fancy and romance, it was because it was seen from a distance by the imagination, not lived in by the soul and in its spirit, as is done by the true seer and poet of this supernature or other-nature. And all these things, because they have their own reality, have their life and a poetry which makes them its subject can be as vital, as powerful, as true as the song which makes beautiful the physical life and normal passions and emotions of men and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of our bodily sense-experience.\n\nBut still all life is one and a new human mind moves towards the realisation of its totality and oneness. The poetry which voices the oneness and totality of our being and Nature and the worlds and God, will not make the actuality of our earthly life less but more real and rich and full and wide and living to men. To know other countries is not to belittle but enlarge our own country and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> it to a greater power of its own<span class='page-number' id='s-251' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.251]</span> being, and to know the other countries of the soul is to widen our bounds and make more opulent and beautiful the earth on which we live. To bring the gods into our life is to raise it to its own diviner powers. To live in close and abiding intimacy with Nature and the spirit in her is to free our daily living from its prison of narrow preoccupation with the immediate moment and act and to give the moment the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> of all Time and the background of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span> and the daily act the foundation of an eternal peace and the large momentum of the universal Power. To bring God into life, the sense of the self in us into all our personality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>, the powers and vistas of the Infinite into our mental and material existence, the oneness of the self in all into our experience and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and relations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and mind with all that is around us is to help to divinise our actual being and life, to force down its fences of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> and blindness and unveil the human godhead that individual man and his race can become if they will and lead us to our most vital perfection. This is what a future poetry may do for us in the way and measure in which poetry can do these things, by vision, by the power of the word, by the attraction of the beauty and delight of what it shows us. What philosophy or other mental brooding makes precise or full to our thought, poetry can by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative power</span>, imaging force and appeal to the emotions make living to the soul and heart. This poetry will present to us indeed in forms of power and beauty all the actual life of man, his wonderful and fruitful past, his living and striving present, his yet more living aspiration and hope of the future, but will present it more seeingly as the life of the vast self and spirit within the race and the veiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> in the individual, as an act of the power and delight of universal being, in the greatness of an eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>, in the presence and intimacy of Nature, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with the beauty and wonder of the realms that stretch out beyond earth and its life, in the march to godhead and the significances of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>, in the ever clearer letters and symbols of the self-revealing mystery and not only in its first crude and incomplete actualities; these actualities will themselves be treated with a firmer and finer<span class='page-number' id='s-252' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.252]</span> vision, find their own greater meaning and become to our sight thread of the fine tissue and web of the cosmic work of the Spirit.

But beauty and delight, whatever form it takes,—for we may speak here of the two as one,—has an unaging youth, an eternal moment, an immortal presence.\n\nThe imperative instinct for beauty and the aesthetic demand which set that among the first needs and was not satisfied with anything else if this were neglected or put second in importance, are now things that are almost lost, nowhere general to the human mind, but once they were the sign of the poetic and artistic peoples and the great ages of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and poetry and supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>. The ancient communities who created those fine many-sided cultures which still remain the fountain-head of all our evolving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, had the instinct for beauty, the aesthetic turn of the temperament and formation of the mind almost, it would seem, from the beginning, planted in their spirit and their blood, colouring their outlook so that even before they got the developed intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of it, they created instinctively in the spirit and form of beauty and that is quite half the secret of the compelling and attractive power of the antique cultures. The earliest surviving poetry of ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> was philosophical and religious, the Veda, the Upanishads, and our modern notions tend to divorce these things from the instinct of delight and beauty, to separate the religious and the philosophic from the aesthetic sense; but the miracle of these antique writings is their perfect union of beauty and power and truth, the word of truth coming out spontaneously as a word of beauty, the revealed utterance of that universal spirit who is described in the Upanishads as the eater of the honey of sweetness, *madhvadam puruṣam*; and this high achievement was not surprising in these ancient deep-thinking men who discovered the profound truth that all existence derives from and lives by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of the eternal spirit, in the power of a universal delight, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. The idea of beauty, the spontaneous satisfaction in it, the worship of it as in itself something <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span>, became more intellectually conscious afterwards, was a dominant strain of the later <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian mind</span> and got to its richest outward colour and sensuous passion in the work of the classical writers, while the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the spiritual<span class='page-number' id='s-255' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.255]</span> through the aesthetic sense is the constant sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian art</span>, as it is also the inspiring motive of a great part of the later religion and poetry. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span>, more especially perhaps southern China, for the north has been weighted by a tendency to a more external and formal idea of measure and harmony, had in a different way this fusion of the spiritual and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span> and it is a distinguishing stamp of their art and culture. The Persian had a sort of sensuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> of the transforming <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthesis</span> born of psychic delight and vision. Ancient Greece did all its work of founding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European civilisation</span> by a union of a subtle and active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> with a fine aesthetic spirit and worship of beauty. The Celtic nations again seem always to have had by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> a psychic delicacy and subtlety united with an instinctive turn for imaginative beauty to which we surely owe much of the finer strain in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> literature. But there these spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span> of fusion end and in the mind of later peoples who come in and take possession with a less innate, a more derivative culture, the sense of beauty works with a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and is clogged by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> heavier <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> which are in conflict with and prevent the sureness of the aesthetic perception. There is in their cruder temperament and intelligence a barbaric strain which worships rudely the power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of life and is not at home with the delight of beauty, an ethical and puritanic strain which looks askance at art and beauty and pleasure, a heavy scholastic or a dry scientific intellectual strain which follows after truth with a conscientious and industrious diligence but without vision and fine aesthesis. And the modern mind, inheritor of all this past, is a divided and complex mind which strives at its best to get back at the old thing on a larger scale and realise some oneness of its many strands of experience, but has not yet found the right meeting-place; and it is besides still labouring under the disadvantage of its aberration into a mechanical, economical, materialistic, utilitarian civilisation from which it cannot get free, though it is struggling to shake off that dullest side of it for which a naked and unashamed riot of ugliness could be indulged in without any prickings of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span> but rather with a smug self-righteousness in the hideous, the vulgar and the<span class='page-number' id='s-256' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.256]</span> ignoble. The day when we get back to the ancient worship of delight and beauty, will be our day of salvation; for without these things there can be neither an assured nobility and sweetness in poetry and art, nor a satisfied dignity and fullness of life nor a harmonious perfection of the spirit.\n\nAn insufficiently profound and intimate perception of the real deep soul of poetic delight and beauty is the first obstacle to a recovery of the old strong soundness of the aesthetic sense and spontaneity of the aesthetic impulse. This comes from the peculiar <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the modern intelligence and its want of harmony between our internal selves and our external experience; there is little spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of their meeting, an active labour to assimilate, but no happy, deep or satisfied possession either of self or life, a continual seeking but no repose in the thing found, a feverish restlessness without home and abiding-place. The spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> can make its home in either one of two things, the depths of our self arrived at through vision of self-knowledge, through power of self-mastery or through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>, or a profound, a glad and satisfied acceptance of the truth, the delight and beauty of the world and life, of existence and experience. And either of these things can <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> too to bring in the other,—possess the inner self and life can become happy and illumined by a full sense of its hidden significance, or get hold of the complete delight and beauty of life and the world and you have then only a thin layer of shining mist to break through to get also at the self and spirit behind it, the eater of the honey of sweetness who is seated in the soul of man and extends himself through the universe. The ancient peoples had in a very large measure this foundation of satisfaction and harmony, took the greatest interest in the reality of the inner self, as once in India and China, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>, the Tao, and life and the world as its field of expression and self-experience or, like the Greeks, felt at once the naturalness and profundity of human existence and gave to it an immediate and subtle aesthetic response. The modern mind on the contrary looks little into our deepest self, takes little interest in sounding that depth and has hardly any confidence in its reality, and concentrates not on the truth and delight and<span class='page-number' id='s-257' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.257]</span> beauty of life, but upon the stress of its results and circumstances, which in themselves have only an incidental and no satisfying and harmonious meaning, and on the agitating or attractive turmoil of the mind excited by their contact or their siege.[^1] This difference results in a fundamental difference of aesthesis. The pure aesthetic spirit ought to be left free, trusted in, made <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and creation and it will then create with greatness and beauty, in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and satisfied ecstasy, and yet safely harmonise its action with the other spiritual powers of our existence, the need of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span>, the insistent seeking of the thought-mind, the demand of the active will and the senses. But we now make the aesthetic sense and intelligence a servant of these other powers; it is condemned to serve first and foremost our external interest in life or our interest in thought or in troubled personality or the demand of the senses or passions and bidden to make them <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> or vivid to us by an active aesthetic cerebration and artistic manufacture of the word or a supply of carefully apt or beautiful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and measures. The secondary things are put in the first rank, the primary, the one thing needful has to get in as best it can to give some firm base to the creation. This aesthesis aided by the vast curiosity of the modern intelligence has done some great and much interesting work, but it arrives with difficulty at the readily fused harmonies and assured stamp of the perfect way of spiritual creation.\n\n[^1]: This is the result perhaps of an ill-assimilated Christian influence intervening on the external vitalism of the Teutonic temperament and on Latin intellectualism, and bringing in new needs and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> which disturbed the mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> without possessing the soul with peace or arriving at a harmony of spiritual emotion and spiritual self-knowledge.\n\nThere is a profound intrinsic delight and beauty in all things and behind all experience whatever face it wears to the surface mind, which makes it to a spirit housed within us other than its first appearance, makes it, that is to say, no longer a thing exciting mental interest, pain, pleasure, but rather a revelation of the truth and power and delight of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> and our feeling of it a form of the universal Ananda of the old philosophical thinkers, the calm yet moved ecstasy with which the spirit of existence<span class='page-number' id='s-258' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.258]</span> regards itself and its creations. This deeper spiritual feeling, this Ananda is the fountain of poetic delight and beauty. It springs from a supreme essence of experience, a supreme aesthesis which is in its own nature spiritual, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>, independent of the personal reactions and passions of the mind, and that is why the poet is able to transmute pain and sorrow and the most tragic and terrible and ugly things into forms of poetic beauty, because of this impersonal joy of the spirit in all experience, whatever its nature. And as, therefore, the subject of the poet is all that he can feel of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> life of the spirit that creates in existence and all that he can seize of the infinite truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and Nature and our own and the world's being, so too what he brings out from his subject is all that he can pour into speech of his vision of eternal and universal beauty, all that he can express of the soul's universal delight in existence. That is what he has to reveal, and to make others share in, to render more expressive and firmly present to them what experience they have of it and help the race towards its greater fullness in the soul of man and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> in our mind and life. This Ananda is not the pleasure of a mood or a sentiment or the fine aesthetic indulgence of the sense in the attraction of a form, superficial results and incidents which are often mistaken for that much deeper and greater thing by the minor poetic faculty, the lesser artistic mind, but the enduring delight which, as the ancient idea justly perceived, is the essence of spirit and being and the beauty which all things assume when the spirit lives in the pure joy of creation and experience.\n\nThe universality of this delight and beauty does not mean that we can take whatever we will straight from life and experience, just as it is, and by making it precise and vivid through word and image or dressing it in imaginative colour achieve poetic effect and beauty. That is the theory by which a great deal of our modern endeavour at poetry seems to be guided, as it is the ruling method of inferior poets and the mark too of the lesser or unsuccessful or only partially successful work of greater writers. The error made is to confuse the sources of poetic delight and beauty with the more superficial interest, pain and pleasure which the normal mind takes in the first untransmuted appeal<span class='page-number' id='s-259' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.259]</span> of thought and life and feeling. That in its first crude form or a little deepened by sensitiveness of emotion and a reflective intelligence is the response to existence of the natural mind, the only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the majority, and what it is apt to expect from the poet is that this is what he too shall give to the world and only think it more profoundly, feel it more sensitively, live it with a greater excitement and find for it beauty of word and attraction of rhythm. The poet has in him a double personality, a double instrument of his response to life and existence. There is in him the normal man absorbed in mere living who thinks and feels and acts like others, and there is the seer of things, the supernormal man, the super-soul or delight-soul in touch with the impersonal and eternal fountains of joy and beauty who creates from that source and transmutes by its alchemy all experience into a form of the spirit's Ananda. It is easy for him, if the demand of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> is not constant or if he is not held back by a natural fineness of the poetic conscience, to subject this deeper and greater power to the lower and general demand and put it at the service of his superficial mental experience. He has then to rely on the charm and beauty of word and form to save the externality of his substance. But the genius in him when he is faithful to it, knows that this is not his high way of perfection nor the thing his spirit gave him to do; it is a spiritual transmutation of the substance got by sinking the mental and vital interests in a deeper soul experience which brings the inevitable word and the supreme form and the unanalysable rhythm. The poet is then something more than a maker of beautiful word and phrase, a favoured <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> of the fancy and imagination, a careful fashioner of idea and utterance or an effective poetic thinker, moralist, dramatist or storyteller; he becomes a spokesman of the eternal spirit of beauty and delight and shares that highest creative and self-expressive rapture which is close to the original ecstasy that made existence, the divine Ananda.\n\nThis rapture, the Platonic divine possession and enthusiasm, is born not of mental, but of soul experience, and the more the surface mind gets into the way, the more this divine passion is weakened and diluted by a less potent spirit. The surface mind<span class='page-number' id='s-260' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.260]</span> is powerfully attracted by the stir of the outward passion and excitement, the stress of immediate thought, life and action, hastens to embody it in speech or in deed and has no leisure to transmute life into those greater abiding values of which the soul in its depths is alone capable. But the higher faculties are given us as keys to a deeper experience; the seer, the poet, the artist, the children of the spirit's light and intuition are only true to themselves when they live in the depths of the soul, refuse to be hurried away by the surface <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> of mind and life and wait rather for their own greater voices. The poetry which insists on an external effectiveness, on immediate thought and life and experience, may seize very powerfully the ear of the moment, but is singularly frail in its affectation of power and even if it has strength of body, is hollow and null inside; it fails because it is concerned with immediately vital things perhaps, but not with that which is immortal. That is just why patriotic poetry, war poetry or poetry of the occasion and the moment are so difficult to write greatly and, although it would seem that these things are among the most dynamic and should move most easily to powerful utterance, are oftenest poor in poetic substance and inferior in value. For life they may be dynamic, but they are not so readily dynamic for art and poetry, and precisely because the vital interest, the life attraction is so strong that it is difficult to draw back from the external to the spiritual delight and the spiritual significance. A great poet may do it sometimes, because the constant instinct of his genius is to look <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the surface and the moment to that which is universal and eternal behind the personal experience and the occasion is only for him an excuse for its utterance. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> of action and mere passion is for the same reason short-lived in its gusto of vitality, fades in a century or less into a lifeless mask, while the drama of the soul abides, because it gets near to the subtler eternal element, the soul's essential aesthesis, the spirit's delight in self-creation and experience. Philosophical and religious poetry too fails so often by a neglect of the same fine distinction, because the interest of the thought pursued by the intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, the interest of the mind in its surface religious ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> get the upper hand<span class='page-number' id='s-261' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.261]</span> and do not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to sink themselves in the spiritual emotion of the seeing of truth and the abiding spiritual experience. The mental and vital interest, pleasure, pain of thought, life, action is not the source of poetic delight and beauty and can be turned into that deeper thing only when they have sunk into the soul and been transmuted in the soul's radiant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> into spiritual experience,—that perhaps was what the Greeks meant when they made Mnemosyne the eternal mother of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>muses</span>; the passions can only change into poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> when they have been spiritualised in the same bright sources and have undergone the purification, the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>katharsis</span>*, spoken of by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> critic; the life values are only poetic when they have come out heightened and changed into soul values. The poetic delight and beauty are born of a deeper rapture and not of the surface mind's excited interest and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of life and existence.\n\nThe ancient Indian critics defined the essence of poetry as *rasa* and by that word they meant a concentrated taste, a spiritual essence of emotion, an essential aesthesis, the soul's pleasure in the pure and perfect sources of feeling. The memory of the soul that takes in, broods over and transmutes the mind's thought, feeling and experience, is a large part of the process which comes by this aesthesis, but it is not quite the whole thing; it is rather only a common way by which we get at something that stands behind, the spiritual being in us which has the secret of the universal delight and the eternal beauty of existence. That which we call genius works or comes out from something deep within which calls down the word, the vision, the light and power from a level above the normal mind and it is the sense of the inrush from above which makes the rapture and the enthusiasm of illumination and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>. That source, when we know better the secrets of our being, turns out to be the spiritual self with its diviner consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, happier fountains of power, inalienable delight of existence. The cultures that were able directly or indirectly to feel the joy of this self and spirit, got into the very strain of their aesthesis the touch of its delight, its Ananda, and this touch was the secret of the generalised instinct for beauty which has been denied to a later mind limited by<span class='page-number' id='s-262' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.262]</span> intellectual activity, practical utility and the externals of life: we have to go for it to exceptional individuals gifted with a finer strain, but the wide-spread aesthetic instinct has been lost and has yet to be recovered for the common mind and recognised once more as a part of human perfection as indispensable as intellectual knowledge and at least as necessary to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> as vital well-being. But this Ananda, this delight, this aesthesis which is the soul of poetic beauty works like other things, like poetic truth or the poetic breath of life, on different levels, in different provinces of its action, with the same law that we have observed in the rest, of the emergence of a richer and profounder face of itself the more it gets inward and upward from the less to the more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occult powers</span> of its revelation. This finer soul of delight throws itself out on the physical mind and being, takes up its experiences and turns them by its own innate and peculiar power into things of beauty, fuses into itself the experiences of the life soul and transmutes to beauty their power and passion in the surge of its poetic ecstasy, takes up all life and form into the reflective thought-mind and changes them in the beauty and rapture of thought discovering and embodying new values of soul and Nature and existence. And in all its working there is felt its own essence of an intuitive delight which acts in these moulds and gets into them whatever it can of its own intimate and eternal delight values. But when that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> self-finding, self-seeing, self-creating in a higher power of light and vision than is possible on the intellectual or other levels gets out into full play, and now there is some sign of this emergence, then we come nearer to the most potent sources of universal and eternal delight and beauty, nearer to its full and wide seeing, and its all-embracing rapture. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner mind</span> is the first native power of the self and spirit dropping its lower veils and the very life and aesthesis of the spirit in its creation is a life of self-experiencing spiritual delight and a luminous Ananda.\n\nThe beauty and delight of such a greater intuitive inspiration, a poetry of this spiritual Ananda making all existence luminous and wonderful and beautiful to us may be one of the gifts of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. It is that of which we stand in need and<span class='page-number' id='s-263' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.263]</span> of which there is some promise in the highest strains that we have now begun to hear. This change will mean that poetry may resume on a larger scale, with a wider and more shining vision the greater effect it once had on the life of the race in the noble antique cultures. At one time poetry was a revelation to the race of the life of the gods and man and the meaning of the world and the beauty and power of existence and through its vision and joy and the height and clarity of its purpose it became creative of the life of the people. Ananda, the joy of the spirit in itself carrying in it a revelation of the powers of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>, was to the ancient Indian idea the creative principle, and ancient poetry did thus creatively reveal to the people its soul and its possibilities by forms of beauty and suggestions of power in a way we have to a great extent lost by our later pettier use of this always great art and medium. One might almost say that ancient India was created by the Veda and Upanishads and that the visions of inspired seers made a people. That sublime poetry with its revelation of godhead and the joy and power of life and truth and immortality or its revelation of the secrets of the self and the powers of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> in man and the universe and of man's return to self-knowledge got into the very blood and mind and life of the race and made itself the fountain-head of all that incessant urge to spirituality which has been its distinguishing gift and cultural motive. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span> and the Ramayana revealing to it in forms of noble beauty and grandiose or beautiful or telling types of character the joy of its forms of life, the significance of its spiritual, ethical and aesthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, the powers and dangers of the human soul, its godheads and its titanisms have played a great and well-recognised formative part second only to religion and the stress of religio-social training in the life of the Indian peoples. And even later the religious poetry of the Vaishnavas, Shaivas, Shaktas has entered powerfully into the life of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and helped to shape its temperament and soul-type. The effect of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homeric poems</span> in Greece, the intimate connection of poetry and art with the public life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Athens</span> sprang from a similar but less steep height of poetic and artistic motive. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> poems revealed the Hellenic people to itself<span class='page-number' id='s-264' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.264]</span> in the lucid and clear nobility and beauty of an uplifting of life and an aesthetic sense of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> of man; the later art and poetry interpreted to Athens her religious ideas, her thought, her aesthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, the soul of grandeur and beauty of her culture.\n\nAnd in all these instances, as in others like the art and poetry of Japan and of China, a more or less profoundly intuitive creation from the depths and expression through poetic delight of the soul of a people has been the secret of this effect and this power of creation or influence. But in other times and places poetry has been more a servant of aesthetic pleasure than a creative master of life and great spiritual agent; when it is at all great, it cannot fail to be that to a certain extent, but it has not so acted as a whole, centrally, in the same large and effective way or with the same high conscience of its function. It has leaned too much on the surface or external interests of life for the pleasure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and imagination and failed too much to create life from within by a deeper delight in the power of vision of the soul and spirit. The high energy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> has done great and interesting things; it has portrayed life with charm and poetic interest in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span>, made thought and character and action and passion wonderful to the life soul in us in Shakespeare, seen and spoken with nobility and grandeur of vision and voice in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>, intellectualised vigorous or pointed commonplace in Pope and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span>, played with elegance and beauty on the lesser strings with the Victorians or cast out here and there a profounder strain of thought or more passionate and aspiring voice, and if the most spiritual strains have been few, yet it has dreamed in light in Shelley or drawn close in Wordsworth to the soul in Nature. And it may seem hard to say in the face of all this splendour and vigour and glow and beauty and of the undeniable cultural influence, that something was too often lacking which would have made the power of this poetry more central and intimate and a greater direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> on the life of the people, and yet this is, I think, true in spite of exceptions, not only here, but of almost all the later European literature. To get back to a profounder centre, to create from<span class='page-number' id='s-265' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.265]</span> within in a more universal power of the spirit and its vision and delight of existence will supply the missing element and make poetry once again young and mighty and creative and its word deeply effective on life by the power of a greater Ananda.\n\nThe mind of man, a little weary now of the superficial pleasure of the life and intellect, demands, obscurely still, not yet perceiving what will satisfy it, a poetry of the joy of self, of the deeper beauty and delight of existence. A merely cultured poetry fair in form and word and playing on the surface strings of mind and emotion will not serve its purpose. The human mind is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> to an unprecedented largeness of vision of the greatness of the worlds, the wonder of life, the self of man, the mystery of the spirit in him and the universe. The future poetry must seek in that vision its inspiration, and the greater its universality of joy in existence, the more it seeks through intuitive sight and aesthesis the deepest fountains of poetic delight and beauty, the more it will become powerfully creative of a greater life for the race. The modern poet is perfectly right in a way in breaking down in whatever direction the bounds erected by the singers of the past around their magic palace and its grounds; he must claim all things in heaven or earth or beyond for his portion: but that care for a fine poetic beauty and delight which they safeguarded by excluding all or most that did not readily obey its law or turn to fair <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> of poetic shaping, he must preserve as jealously and satisfy by steeping all that he finds in his wider field in that profoundest vision which delivers out of each thing its spiritual Ananda, the secret of truth and beauty in it for which it was created; it is in the sense of that spiritual joy of vision, and not in any lower sensuous, intellectual or imaginative seeing, that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span>' phrase becomes true for the poet, beauty that is truth, truth that is beauty, and this all that we need to know as the law of our aesthetic knowledge. He is right too in wishing to make poetry more intimately one with life, but again in this sense only, in going back to those creative fountains of the spirit's Ananda from which life is seen and reshaped by the vision that springs from a moved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>,—the inmost source of the authentic poet vision. The beauty and delight of all physical things<span class='page-number' id='s-266' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.266]</span> illumined by the wonder of the secret spiritual self that is the inhabitant and self-sculptor of form, the beauty and delight of the thousand-coloured, many-crested, million-waved miracle of life made a hundred times more profoundly meaningful by the greatness and the sweetness and attracting poignancy of the self-creating inmost soul which makes of life its epic and its drama and its lyric, the beauty and delight of the spirit in thought, the seer, the thinker, the interpreter of his own creation and being who broods over all he is and does in man and the world and constantly resees and shapes it new by the stress and power of his thinking, this will be the substance of the greater poetry that has yet to be written. And that can be discovered only if and so far as the soul of man looks or feels beyond even these things and sees and voices the eternal and knows its godheads and gets to some close inward touch of the infinite ecstasy which is the source of the universal delight and beauty. For the nearer we get to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> Ananda, the greater becomes our joy in man and the universe and the receptive and creative spiritual emotion which needs for its voice the moved tones of poetic speech.<span class='page-number' id='s-267' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.267]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-soul-of-poetic-delight-and-beauty","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Power of the Spirit","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-power-of-the-spirit","prvt":"The Breath of Greater Life","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-breath-of-greater-life","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-power-of-the-spirit"],"t":"The Power of the Spirit","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A poetry born direct from and full of the power of the spirit and therefore a largest and a deepest self-expression of the soul and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of the race is that for which we are seeking and of which the more profound tendencies of the creative mind seem to be in travail.

This can only come if the mind of the race takes actually the step over which it is now hesitating and passes from the satisfaction of the liberated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> which has been its preoccupation for the last two centuries to the pursuit of the realisation of the larger self, from the scrutiny of the things that explain to the experience of the things that reveal, the truths of the spirit. The progress of the mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> takes place by a constant enlarging attended with a constant transmutation of its experience which is reflected in its ways of self-expression, and the tendency of this progression is always more and more inward, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> that cannot cease till we get to the inmost, and even then there can be no real cessation because the inmost is the infinite. The progress of poetry, as it has been viewed in these pages, has been an index of an advance of the cultural mind of humanity which has enlarged its scope by a constant raising of the scale of the soul's experience and has now risen to a great height and breadth of intellectual vision and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, and the question is at present of the next step in the scale of ascension, and whether<span class='page-number' id='s-268' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.268]</span> it can now be firmly taken or will be missed once more with a fall back to another retracing of the psychological circuit. That will determine the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the coming era of the mind and life of man and consequently the character of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> his methods of aesthetic self-expression.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> thing that man sees above the intellect is the spirit, and therefore the developed intellect of the race, if it is at all to go forward, must open now to an understanding and seeing spirituality, other than the rather obscure religionism of the past which belonged to the lower levels of the life and the emotion and which has had its bounds broken and its narrownesses condemned by the free light of intellectual thought: this will be rather an illumined self-knowledge and God-knowledge and a world-knowledge too which transmuted in that greater light will spiritualise the whole view and motive of our existence. That is the one development to which an accomplished intellectualism can open and by exceeding itself find its own right consummation. The alternative is a continual ringing of changes in the spinnings of the intellectual circle which leads nowhere or else a collapse to the lower levels which may bring human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> down with a run to a new corrupted and intellectualised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>barbarism</span>. This is a catastrophe which has happened before in the world's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>, and it was brought about ostensibly by outward events and causes, but arose essentially from an inability of the intellect of man to find its way out of itself and out of the vital formula in which its strainings and questionings can only exhaust itself and life into a full illumination of the spirit and an enlightened application of the saving spiritual principle to mind and life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. The possibility of such a catastrophe is by no means absent from the present human situation. On the one hand the straining of the intellect to its limits of elasticity has brought in a recoil to a straining for unbridled vital, emotional and sensational experience and a morbid disorder in the economy of the nature and on the other there have come in, perhaps as a result, perturbations of the earth system that threaten to break up the mould of civilisation, and the problem of the race is whether a new and greater mould can be created<span class='page-number' id='s-269' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.269]</span> or instead a collapse and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span> intervene and a recommencing of the circle. The hope of the race in this crisis lies in the fidelity of its intellect to the larger perceptions it now has of the greater self of humanity, the turning of its will to the inception of delivering <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of thought, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and social endeavour which arise from those perceptions and the raising of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectual mind</span> to the intuitive supra-intellectual spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> which can alone give the basis for a spiritualised life of the race and the realisation of its diviner potentialities. The meaning of spirituality is a new and greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> of man founded in the consciousness of his true, his inmost, highest and largest self and spirit by which he receives the whole of existence as a progressive manifestation of the self in the universe and his own life as a field of a possible transformation in which its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> sense will be found, its potentialities highly evolved, the now imperfect forms changed into an image of the divine perfection, and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> not only to see but to live out these greater possibilities of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>.

This poetry will speak of new things and of old things in a new way and with a new voice, not by any exclusion or diminution of its province, but by a great heightening above, a great intimacy within, a great enlargement and wideness around, a vision of inmost things and therefore a changed vision of the world and life and the untold potentialities of the soul's experience. It will restore to us the sense of the Eternal, the presence of the Divine which has been taken from us for a time by an intellect too narrowly and curiously fixed on the external and physical world, but it will not speak of these things in the feeble and conventional tones of traditional religion, but as a voice of intuitive experience and<span class='page-number' id='s-270' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.270]</span> the rhythm and chant of the revelation of an eternal presence. The voice of the poet will reveal to us by the inspired rhythmic word the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> who is the Self of all things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, the Life of the universe, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> in man, and he will express all the emotion and delight of the endeavour of the human soul to discover the touch and joy of that Divinity within him in whom he feels the mighty founts of his own being and life and effort and his fullness and unity with all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> experience and with Nature and with all creatures.

A poetry of this kind will be in a supreme way what all art should be, a thing of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and joy and illumination, a solution and release of the soul from its vital unrest and questioning and struggle, not by any ignoring of these things but by an uplifting into the strength of the self within and the light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> of its greater view where there is found not only the point of escape but the supporting calmness and power of a seated knowledge, mastery and deliverance. In the greatest art and poetry there should be something of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> basing and elevating the effort and struggle of the personality, something of the largeness of the universal releasing and harmonising the troubled concentrations of the individual existence, something of the sense of the transcendent raising the inferior, ignorant and uncertain powers of life towards a greater strength and light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. And when art and poetry can utter the fullest sense of these things, it is then that they will become the greatest fortifiers and builders of the soul of man and assure it in the grandeur of its own largest self and spirit. The poetry of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> has been a voice intensely eager and moved but restless, troubled and without a sure base of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> and repose, vibrating with the<span class='page-number' id='s-271' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.271]</span> passion of life and avid of its joy and pleasure and beauty, but afflicted also by its unrest, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, tragedy, discord, insufficiency, incertitude, capable only of its lesser harmonies, not of any great release and satisfaction. The art and poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> have been the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of a larger and quieter spirit, intensely responsive as in the far East to deeper psychic significances and finding there fine and subtle harmonies of the soul's experience or, as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, expressing in spite of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> creed of vanity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> much rather the greatness and power and satisfied activity of human thought and life and action and behind it the communion of the soul with the Eternal. The poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> reconciling all these strains, taking the highest as its keynote and interpreting the rest in its intensity and its largeness, will offer to the human mind a more complex aesthetic and spiritual satisfaction, express a more richly filled content of self-experience raised to a more persistent sight of things <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> and infinite and a more potent and all-comprehending release into the calm and delight of the spirit.\n\nAnd this poetry must bring with it too a new depth of the intimacies of the soul with Nature. The early poetry of Nature gave us merely the delight of the forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> and the beauty of the setting of the natural world around man's life, but not any inner communion between him and the universal Mother. A later tone brought in more of the subtleties of the vital soul of the natural world and a response of the moved sensation and emotion of the life-spirit in us and out of this arose an intellectual and aesthetic sense of hidden finer and subtler things and, more profound, in the poetry of Wordsworth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Keats</span> and Shelley an attempt at communion with a universal presence in Nature and a living principle of peace or light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> or universal power or conscious delight and beauty. A more deeply seeing and intimate poetry will take up these things into a yet greater Nature sense and vision and make us aware of the very self and soul and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> of Nature, her profoundest psychic suggestion and significance, the spirit in her and the intuition of all that she keeps hidden in her forms and veils and reveals more and more to the soul that has entered into<span class='page-number' id='s-272' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.272]</span> unity with that spirit. The more intuitive human mind of the future, delivered from its present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> of sympathy by the touch of the one self in all being, will feel as has not been felt before a unity with other consciousness in Nature and hear the voice of self-revelation of all that is mute to us, the soul and life of things that now seem inert and lifeless, the soul and life of the animal world, the soul and life of the things that grow in silence and are enclosed in the absorbed dream of their own half-conscient existence. And it will open to and interpret not only man and terrestrial Nature, for a poetry concerned with that alone excludes large ranges of self-experience, but other domains also of our spirit. It will give the key of the worlds of supernature, and allow us to move among the beings and scenes, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> and influences and presences of the psychic kingdoms which are near to us behind their dark or luminous curtain and will not be afraid to enter into vaster realms of the self and other universal states and the powers that stand behind our life and the soul's eternal spaces. It will do this not merely in a symbol of greatened human magnitudes, as the old poets represented the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>, or in hues of romantic glamour or in the far-off light of a mystic remoteness, but with the close directness and reality that comes from intimate vision and feeling, and make these things a part of our living experience.\n\nA poetry of large spiritual inspiration must necessarily be, when it is not dealing directly with eternal things and turns its eye on the movement of time and the actual life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of man, largely present and futurist in its insistence. The poet will continue though in a new way and with a new eye to transfigure the past for us, but will not feel that need to live in an imaginative preoccupation with the past which withdraws compelled from the unmanageable and transformable actuality of the present: for to live in the spirit is to be able to distinguish the eternal in the transient forms of the moment and to see too in these forms a revelation of the spirit's greater significances. His vision will search all the ways of the present and interpret deeply to man the sense of that which is making him and which he is making: it will reveal the divinity in all its disguises, face all even that is ugly and<span class='page-number' id='s-273' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.273]</span> terrible and baffling in the enigma of our actual human life, find its deeper <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthesis</span>, disengage what is struggling untransformed in its outsides and make out of it by poetic sympathy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> of spiritual truth and beauty. This is a strain that has been growing in recent poetic creation and it suffers as yet too often from an insufficient fineness of insight and a too crude handling, but, that immaturity once overcome, must hold a large and assured place among the great poetic motives. But especially a clearer and more inspiring vision of the destiny of the spirit in man will be a large part of the poetry of the future. For the spiritual eye is not only able to see the divinity in man as he is, the divinity in his struggle and victory and failure and even in his sin and offence and littleness, but the spirit is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the future, its past and present in time not only the half-formed stuff of its coming ages, but in a profound sense it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> and attraction of the future that makes the past and present, and that future will be more and more seen to be the growth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> which is the high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of this race that thinks and wills and labours towards its own perfection. This is a strain that we shall hear more and more, the song of the growing godhead of the kind, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human unity</span>, of spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, of the coming supermanhood of man, of the divine ideal seeking to actualise itself in the life of the earth, of the call to the individual to rise to his godlike possibility and to the race to live in the greatness of that which humanity feels within itself as a power of the spirit which it has to deliver into some yet ungrasped perfect form of clearness. To embellish life with beauty is only the most outward function of art and poetry, to make life more intimately <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and noble and great and full of meaning is its higher office, but its highest comes when the poet becomes the seer and reveals to man his eternal self and the godheads of its manifestation.\n\nThese new voices must needs be the result of the growth of the power of the spirit on the mind of man which is the promise of a coming era. It is always indeed the spirit in him that shapes his poetic utterance; but when that spirit is preoccupied with the outward life, the great poets are those who make his common life and action and its surroundings splendid and beautiful and<span class='page-number' id='s-274' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.274]</span> noble to him by the power of their vision; when it is the intellect through which it labours, the great poets are those who give a profound enlightening idea and creative interpretation of the world and nature and all that man is and does and thinks and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>, but when the spirit turns to its own large intuitive will and vision, then it is yet profounder things to which the great poet must give utterance, the inmost sense of things, the inmost consciousness of Nature, the movement of the deepest soul of man, the truth that reveals the meaning of existence and the universal delight and beauty and the power of a greater life and the infinite potentialities of our experience and self-creation. These may not be the only strains, but they will be the greatest and those which the highest human mind will demand from the poet and they will colour all the rest by their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of new vistas to the general <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> and life sense of the race. And whatever poetry may make its substance or its subject, this growth of the power of the spirit must necessarily bring into it a more intense and revealing speech, a more inward and subtle and penetrating rhythm, a greater stress of sight, a more vibrant and responsive sense, the eye that looks at all smallest and greatest things for the significances that have not yet been discovered and the secrets that are not on the surface. That will be the type of the new utterance and the boundless field of poetic discovery left for the inspiration of the humanity of the future.<span class='page-number' id='s-275' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.275]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-power-of-the-spirit","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Form and the Spirit","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-form-and-the-spirit","prvt":"The Soul of Poetic Delight and Beauty","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-soul-of-poetic-delight-and-beauty","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-form-and-the-spirit"],"t":"The Form and the Spirit","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A change in the spirit of poetry must necessarily bring with it a change of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, and this departure may be less or greater to the eye, more inward or more outward, but always there must be at least some subtle and profound alteration which, whatever the apparent fidelity to old moulds, is certain to amount in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> to a transmutation, since even the outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and effect become other than they were and the soul of substance and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> a new thing.

It wells out from the intensity of touch and the spiritualised emotion of a more delicate or a deeper and more penetrating sight and feeling in the experience, captures and sustains the inevitable cadences of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> or its attraction, sets the subtle measure of its feeling and keeps it by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> of its steps in sound vibrating on the inner strings and psychic fibres. The lyric is a moment of heightened soul experience, sometimes brief in a lightness of aerial rapture, in a poignant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of pain, of joy or of mingled emotion or in a swift graver exaltation, sometimes prolonged and repeating or varying the same note, sometimes linking itself in a sustained succession to other moments that start from it or are suggested by its central motive.

And the lyrical spirit may rest satisfied with these clear spontaneities of song or else it may prefer to weight its steps with thought and turn to a meditative movement or, great-winged, assume an epic elevation, or lyricise the successive moments of an action, or utter the responses of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> to heart, mind to mind, soul to soul, move between suggestions and counter-suggestions of mood and idea and feeling and devise a lyrical seed or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of drama. The widest in range as it is the most flexible in form and motive of all the poetic kinds, the others have grown out of it by the assumption of a more settled and deliberate and extended speech and a more ample structure. It is therefore in the lyric nearest to the freshness of an original impulse that a new spirit in poetry is likely to become aware of itself and feel out for its right ways of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> and to discover<span class='page-number' id='s-277' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.277]</span> with the most adaptable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and variety its own essential motives and cadences, first forms and simpler structures before it works out victoriously its greater motions or ampler figures in narrative and drama.\n\nThe freshest and most spontaneous liquidities of song utterance abounded in past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> at times when the direct movement of the life-spirit, whether confined to simple primary emotion and experience or deepening to the more vivid probings of its own richer but still natural self-aesthesis, has been the fountain-head of a stirred poetic utterance. It is then that there come the pure lyric outbursts and the poet is content to sing and let the feeling create its own native moulds of music. The thought satisfied with its own emotion is not too insistent to elaborate the lyrical form for its more intricate purposes or to give it certainly a weightier but almost inevitably a less simply rapturous movement. The intellectual ages sing less easily. It is their care to cut and carve the lyrical form with a self-conscious and considering art and their practice arrives at measures and movements of a consummate literary perfection, much power of modulation, a moved thinking and sentiment deliberately making the most of its own possibilities; but except in the voices of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> or two who are born with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> and need of the pure lyrical impulse, the too developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> cannot often keep or recover <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>'s first fine careless rapture or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of it into its own more loaded tones and measures. The lyric poetry of the ancient classical tongues is largely of this character and we find it there confined to a certain number of highly developed forms managed with a perfect and careful technique, and the movement of poetic feeling, sometimes grave, sometimes permitted a lighter and more rapid impulsion, is chastened and subdued to the service of the reflective poetic intelligence. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> simplicities and spontaneities of the soul's emotion which were the root of the original lyric impulse get only an occasional opportunity of coming back to the surface, and in their place there is the movement of a more thoughtful and often complex sentiment and feeling, not freshets of song, but the larger wave of the chant and elegy and ode: the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span><span class='page-number' id='s-278' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.278]</span> of the field and mountain self-sown on the banks or near the sources are replaced by the blossoms of a careful culture. Still however reined in or penetrated and rendered grave by thought, the life of feeling is still there and the power and sincerity of the lyrical impulse abide as the base of the workings of the moved intelligence. But in the literary ages that are classical by imitation, there is ordinarily a great poverty, an absence or thinness of the lyrical element, the sincerity and confident self-pleasure of the feeling indispensable to the lyrical movement wither under the coldly observant and too scrutinising eye of the reflective reason, and the revival of song has to await the romantic movement of interest of a more eager and a wider intelligence which will endeavour to get back to some joy of the intimate powers of life and the vivid lyricism of the heart and the imagination. There is then a return by an imaginative effort to old cultivated forms of lyrical expression and to early simple movements like the ballad motive and in the end a great variety of experiments in new metrical moulds and subtle modifications of old structures, an attempt of the idea to turn back the thought mind to grave or happy sincerities of emotion or impose on it a more absolute assent to bare simplicities of thought and feeling and finally a living curiosity of the intelligence in the expression of all kinds and shades of sensation and emotion. The work of this developed poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> differs from the early work whose spirit and manner it often tries hard to recover because it is the thought that is primarily at work and the form less a spontaneous creation of the soul than a deliberately intelligent structure, and while the movement of the pure lyrical impulse is entirely shaped by the feeling and the thought only accompanies it in its steps, here the thought actively intervenes and determines and cannot but sophisticate the emotional movement. This distinction has <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> consequences and most this pregnant result that even the simplicities of a developed poetical thought are willed simplicities and the end is a curiosity of work that has many triumphs of aesthetic satisfaction but not often any longer the native tones of the soul when the pure lyrical feeling was still possible.<span class='page-number' id='s-279' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.279]</span>\n\nThe turn to a more direct self-expression of the spirit must find out its way first by the emergence of a new kind of lyrical sincerity which is neither the directness of the surface life <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> nor the moved truth of the thought mind seizing or observing the emotion and bringing out its thought significances. There are in fact only two pure and absolute sincerities here, the power of the native intuition of itself by life which has for its result a direct and obvious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> of the thing felt and its expression, and the power of identity of the spirit when it takes up thought and feeling and life and makes them one with some inmost absolute truth of their and our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. There is a power too of the sincerities of thought, but that is an intermediary between life and the spirit and only poetic when it fills itself with the sense of one of the others or links them together or aids to bring them to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. It is therefore a transition from the lyricism of life weighted by the stresses of thought to the lyricism of the inmost spirit which uses but is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> thought that has to be made. And here we notice a significant tendency, an endeavour to present life in an utmost clarity of its intention and form and outline stripped and discharged of the thought's abundant additions, made naked of the haze of the reflective intelligence, the idea <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> that we shall thus get at its bare truth and feeling, its pure vital intuition where that starts out of the subconscious suggestion and meets the seeing mind and a conscious identity can be created with its sense in our souls by the revealing fidelity of the expression. There is often added to this endeavour the injunction that the rhythmic movement should follow the fluctuations of life with a subtle adaptation of the verbal music, and this notion is used to justify the now common free or else irregular and often broken-backed verse which is supposed to be the medium of a subtler correspondence than is at all possible to the formal rigidity of fixed metres. But in actual fact this kind of verse, whatever its power of lyric intention, sensibly fails to give us the satisfaction of a true lyrical form, because it ignores the truth that what sustains the lyrical spirit is the discovery and consistent following of some central cadence revealing the very spirit of the feeling and not at all the sole pursuit of its more<span class='page-number' id='s-280' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.280]</span> outward movements and changes: these can only rightly come in as a modulation of the constant essential music. This double need may possibly be met by a very skilful free movement, but not so easily, straightforwardly and simply as in a fidelity, much more really natural than these overdone niceties, to the once discovered fixed cadence. And besides the bare truth of the vital intuition is not that inmost truth of things our minds are striving to see; that is something much greater, profounder, more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> in its content and unending in its suggestion; not our identity in sight and spiritual emotion with the limited subconscient intention of life, but rather a oneness with something in it at once superconscient, immanent and comprehensive of which that is only a blind index will be the moving power of a greater utterance. And until we have found, whether by spiritual experience or poetic insight, this identity and its revelations in ourselves and in things, we shall not have laid a sound and durable basis for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> creation.\n\nThe essential and decisive step of the future art of poetry will perhaps be to discover that it is not the form which either fixes or reveals the spirit but the spirit which makes out of itself the form and the word and this with so sure a discovery, once we can live in it and create out of it without too much interference from the difficult and devising intellect, that their movement becomes as spontaneously inevitable as the movements and their mould as structurally perfect as the magical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> of inconscient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>. Nature creates perfectly because she creates directly out of life and is not intellectually self-conscious, the spirit will create perfectly because it creates directly out of self and is spontaneously supra-intellectually all-conscious. It is no doubt this truth of a spiritually just and natural creation that some of the present ideas and tendencies are trying to adumbrate, but not as yet as understandingly as one could desire. The decisive revealing lyrical outburst must come when the poet has learnt to live creatively only in the inmost spiritual sight and identity of his own self with the self of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> and to sing only from the deepest spiritual emotion which is the ecstasy of feeling of that identity or at least of some extreme nearness to<span class='page-number' id='s-281' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.281]</span> its sheer directness of touch and vision. And then we may find that this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, this spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>, for it is something more intimate and rapturous than emotion, has brought with it an unprecedented freedom of manifold and many-suggestioned and yet perfectly sufficient and definite formation and utterance. The poetry born from the inmost spirit will not bind the poet in any limiting circle or narrow theory of an intellectual art principle, but create at will according to the truth of the spirit's absolute moments. According to the innate rightnesses of the motive and its needed cadence the spirit will move him to discover infinite possibilities of new spiritual measure and intonation in time-old lyrical rhythms or to find a new principle of rhythm and structure or to make visible developments which will keep past treasures of sound and yet more magically innovate than can be done by any breaking up of forms in order to build a new order out of chaos. The intimate and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive poetry</span> of the future will have on the one side all the inexhaustible range and profound complexities of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> imagination of which it will be the interpreter and to that it must suit a hundred single and separate and combined and harmonic lyrical tones of poignantly or richly moved utterance, and on the other it will reach those bare and absolute simplicities of utter and essential sight in which thought sublimates into a translucidity of light and vision, feeling passes beyond itself into sheer spiritual ecstasy and the word rarefies into a pure voice out of the silence. The sight will determine the lyrical form and discover the identities of an inevitable rhythm and no lesser standard prevail against the purity of this spiritual principle.\n\nA spiritual change must equally come over the intention and form of the drama when once the age has determined its tendencies, and this change is already foreshadowed in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> which is still only at its commencement and first tentatives. Hitherto there have been two forms consecrated by great achievements, the drama of life, whether presenting only vivid outsides and significant incidents and morals and manners or expressive of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> and its workings in event and character and passion, and the drama of the idea or, more vitally,<span class='page-number' id='s-282' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.282]</span> of the idea-power that is made to work itself out in the life movement, lay its hold on the soul's motions, create the type, use the character and the passion for its instruments and at its highest tension appear as an agent of the conflict of ideal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> that produce the more lofty tragedies of human action. The paucity of great creation in the modern drama after one very considerable moment of power and vision has been due largely to an inability to decide between these two motives or to discover a great poetic form for the drama of the idea or effect in the poetic imagination some fusion of the intellectual and the life motive which would be an effective dramatic rendering of the modern way of seeing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and his life. The only recent vital and effective dramatic writing has been in prose and that has taken the questionable shape of the problem play which is peculiarly congenial to the dominating interests of the highly intellectualised but always practical mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> today. The poetic form has long been for the most part a reproduction of past moulds and motives without any roots of vitality in the living mind of the age; but recently there has been a more inward and profounder movement which promises some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of replacing this sort of unsatisfying imitation by a novel and a sincerer kind of dramatic poetry. An attempt has been initiated to create an inner drama of the soul with the soul itself for the real stage. There is in the spirit and the forms of this endeavour a predominance as yet of the lyrical rather than the dramatic motive, an insufficient power of making the characters living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> rather than unsubstantial types or shadows of soul movements or even the figures of a veiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>allegory</span> and parable; and there is needed perhaps for a greater vitality a freer and more nobly aesthetic stage which would not be limited by the external realism that now stands in the way of a living revival of the poetic and artistic theatre. Nevertheless this attempt is a true though not a complete index of the direction the creative mind must take in the future.\n\nThe soul of man, a many-motioned representative of the world-spirit, subsisting and seeking for itself and its own meanings amid the laws and powers and moving forces of the universe<span class='page-number' id='s-283' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.283]</span> and discovering and realising its spiritual relations with others will be the vision and intention of a dramatic poetry fully reflective of the now growing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> of the future. All drama must be a movement of life and of action because its mode of presentation is through the speech of living beings and the interaction of their natures, but equally the real interest except in the least poetic kinds is an internal movement and an action of the soul because dramatic speech is poetically interesting only when it is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of human self-expression and not merely a support for a series of stirring incidents. The drama of the future will differ from the romantic play or tragedy because the thing which dramatic speech will represent will be something more internal than the life soul and its brilliant pageant of passion and character. The external web of events and action, whether sparing or abundant, strongly marked or slight in incidence, will only be outward threads and indices and the movement that will throughout occupy the mind will be the procession of the soul phases or the turns of the soul action: the character, whether profusely filled in in detail in the modern fashion or simply and strongly outlined in the purer ancient method, will not be mistaken for the person, but accepted as only an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> notation of the spirit: the passions, which have hitherto been prominently brought forward as the central stuff of the drama, will be reduced to their proper place as indicative colour and waves on the stream of spiritual self-revelation. And this greater kind will differ too from the classical tragedy of which the method was some significant and governing idea working out its life issues, because the idea will only be to a larger human mind better instructed in the secret of existence the self-view by the soul of its own greater and more intimate issues and of the conscient turns of its existence. The personage of the play will be the spirit in man diversified or multitudinous in many human beings whose inner spiritual much more intimately than their external life relations will determine the development, and the culminations will be steps of solution of those spiritual problems of our existence which after all are at the root of and include and inform all the others. The drama will be no longer an<span class='page-number' id='s-284' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.284]</span> interpretation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span> or self-acting Karma or of the simple or complex natural entanglements of the human life-movement, but a revelation of the Soul as its own fate and determiner of its life and its karma and behind it of the powers and the movements of the spirit in the universe. It will not be limited by any lesser idealisms or realisms, but representing at will this and other worlds, the purpose of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> and the actions of men, man's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span> and man's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>actualities</span> each as real as the other, the struggles and the sufferings and the victories of the spirit, the fixities of Nature and her mutabilities and significant perversions and fruitful conversions, interpret in dramatic form the inmost truth of the action of man the infinite. It will not be limited either by any old or new formal convention, but transmute old moulds and invent others and arrange according to the truth of its vision its acts and the evolution of its dramatic process or the refrain of its lyrical or the march of its epic motive. This clue at least is the largest and the most suggestive for a new and living future creation in the forms of the drama.\n\nThe spirit and intention of the narrative and epic forms of poetry must undergo the same transmuting change. Hitherto the poetical narrative has been a simple relation or a vivid picturing or transcript of life and action varied by description of surrounding circumstance and indication of mood and feeling and character or else that with the development of an idea or a mental and moral significance at the basis with the story as its occasion or form of its presentation. The change to a profounder motive will substitute a soul significance as the real substance, the action will not be there for its external surface interest but as a vital indication of the significance, the surrounding circumstance will be only such as helps to point and frame it and bring out its accessory suggestions and mood and feeling and character its internal powers and phases. An intensive narrative, intensive in simplicity or in richness of significant shades, tones and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span>, will be the more profound and subtle art of this kind in the future and its appropriate structures determined by the needs of this inner art motive. A first form of the intensive and spiritually significant poetic narrative has already been created and<span class='page-number' id='s-285' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.285]</span> attempts to replace the more superficially intellectual motives, where the idea rather supervened upon the story or read into it the sense of its turns or its total movement, but here the story tends more to be the living expression of the idea and the idea itself vibrant in the speech and description and action the index of a profounder soul motive. The future poetry will follow this direction with a more and more subtle and variable inwardness and a greater fusion and living identity of soul motive, indicative idea, suggestive description and intensely significant speech and action. The same governing vision will be there as in lyric and drama; the method of development will alone be different according to the necessities of the more diffused, circumstanced and outwardly processive form which is proper to narrative.\n\nThe epic is only the narrative presentation on its largest canvas and at its highest elevation, greatness and amplitude of spirit and speech and movement. It is sometimes asserted that the epic is solely proper to primitive ages when the freshness of life made a story of large and simple action of supreme interest to the youthful mind of humanity, the literary epic an artificial prolongation by an intellectual age and a genuine epic poetry no longer possible now or in the future. This is to mistake form and circumstance for the central reality. The epic, a great poetic story of man or world or the gods, need not necessarily be a vigorous presentation of external action: the divinely appointed creation of Rome, the struggle of the principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> as presented in the great Indian poems, the pageant of the centuries or the journey of the seer through the three worlds beyond us are as fit themes as primitive war and adventure for the imagination of the epic creator. The epics of the soul most inwardly seen as they will be by an intuitive poetry, are his greatest possible subject, and it is this supreme kind that we shall expect from some profound and mighty voice of the future. His indeed may be the song of greatest flight that will reveal from the highest pinnacle and with the largest field of vision the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of the human spirit and the presence and ways and purpose of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> in man and the universe.<span class='page-number' id='s-286' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.286]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-form-and-the-spirit","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"The Word and the Spirit","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/the-word-and-the-spirit","prvt":"The Power of the Spirit","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-power-of-the-spirit","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-word-and-the-spirit"],"t":"The Word and the Spirit","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A development of the kind of which we are speaking must affect not only the frames of poetry, but initiate also a subtle change of its word and rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>.

And moreover <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> poetry except that of the most outward kind,—a verse movement which is separable rather by distinction of form than power of the soul from prose,—is in its inmost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> intuitive, more a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of the vision and feeling than of the intelligence, and the change made is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the level or the depth of the self from which the poetic intuition, usually modified in transmission, immediately acts, and of its intervening psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> rather than its primary initiating movement. The initiating inspiration must always be intuitive in a greater or lesser degree and it is the form or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> that differs. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> in its use of speech is apt to regard it as an intellectual device, a means for the precise connotation of object and idea or at most an elegant and pleasing or an effective and forceful presentation. The poetic view and use of speech is of a very different kind and enters more into the vital reality of the word and the more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> connection between the movement of the spirit and the significances of the mental utterance. The poet has to do much more than to offer a precise, a harmonious or a forcefully presented idea to the intelligence: he has to give a breath of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> to the word and for that must find out and make full use of its potential power of living suggestion; he has to make it carry in it not only the intellectual notion but the emotion and the psychical sensation of the thing he would make present to us; he has to erect an image of its presence and appeal with which we can inwardly live as we live with the presence and appeal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of the actual universe. As in the Vedic theory the Spirit was supposed to create the worlds by the Word, so the poet brings into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> in himself and us by his creative word fragmentarily or largely, in isolated pieces or massed spaces an inner world of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, objects and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>. But all creation is a mystery in its secret of inmost process and it is only at best the most outward or mechanical part of it which admits analysis; the creative faculty of the poetic mind is no exception. The poet is a magician who hardly knows the secret<span class='page-number' id='s-288' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.288]</span> of his own spell; even the part taken by the consciously critical or constructive mind is less intellectual than intuitive; he creates by an afflatus of spiritual power of which his mind is the channel and instrument and the appreciation of it in himself and others comes not by an intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> but by a spiritual feeling. It is that which must tell him whether the word that comes is the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of his vision or whether he has to seek or to wait for another that shall be felt as its adequate, its effective, its illuminative, its inspired or its inevitable utterance. The distinction that I am trying to draw here between the various powers of the always intuitive speech of poetry can therefore better be felt than critically stated, but at the same time certain indications may serve to make it more clearly sensed in its spirit with the sympathetic aid of the critical intelligence.\n\nThe words which we use in our speech seem to be, if we look only at their external formation, mere physical sounds which a device of the mind has made to represent certain objects and ideas and perceptions,—a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> nervous perhaps in origin, but developed for a constantly finer and more intricate use by the growing intelligence; but if we look at them in their inmost psychological and not solely at their more external aspect, we shall see that what constitutes speech and gives it its life and appeal and significance is a subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> which informs and is the soul of the body of sound: it is a superconscient Nature-Force raising its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> out of our subconscience but growingly conscious in its operations in the human mind that develops itself in one fundamental way and yet variously in language. It is this Force, this Shakti to which the old Vedic thinkers gave the name of Vak, the goddess of creative Speech, and the Tantric psychists supposed that this Power acts in us through different subtle nervous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> on higher and higher levels of its force and that thus the word has a graduation of its expressive powers of truth and vision. One may accept as a clue of great utility this idea of different degrees of the force of speech, each separately characteristic and distinguishable, and recognise one of the grades of the Tantric classification, Pashyanti the seeing word, as the description of that degree of power to which the<span class='page-number' id='s-289' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.289]</span> poetic mind is called to elevate itself and which is original and native to its manner of expression. The degree of word-force characteristic of prose speech avails ordinarily to distinguish and state things to the conceptual intelligence; the word of the poet sees and presents in its body and image to a subtle visual perception in the mind awakened by an inner rhythmic audition truth of soul and thought experience and truth of sense and life, the spiritual and living actuality of idea and object. The prosaist may bring to his aid more or less of the seeing power, the poet dilute his vision with intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> and statement, but the fundamental difference remains that ordinary speech proceeds from and appeals to the conceiving intelligence while it is the seeing mind that is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of poetic utterance.\n\nThis seeing speech has itself, however, different grades of its power of vision and expression of vision. The first and simplest power is limited to a clear poetic adequacy and at its lowest difficult to distinguish from prose statement except by its more compact and vivid force of presentation and the subtle difference made by the rhythm which brings in a living appeal and adds something of an emotional and sensational nearness to what would otherwise be little more than an intellectual expression; but in a higher and much finer clarity this manner has the power to make us not only conceive adequately, but see the object or idea in a certain temperate lucidity of vision. The difference can best be illustrated by an example of each kind taken at random, one from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dryden</span>,\n\n>Whate'er he did was done with so much ease,\nIn him alone 'twas natural to please:—\n\nand the other from Wordsworth,\n\n>The waves beside them danced, but they\nOutdid the sparkling waves in glee:\nA poet could not but be gay\nIn such a jocund company.<span class='page-number' id='s-290' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.290]</span>\n\nThe first is in the manner of terse prose statement, but made just poetical by a certain life and vividness and a rhythmic suggestion touching though not deeply some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional centre</span> of response just sufficient to make it a thought felt and not merely presented to the conception: the other though not going <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> a luminously clear and strong poetical adequacy in its manner of speech is far away from this doubtful borderland and from the beginning a thing seen and lived within us and awakening a satisfied soul response. It has the native <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the seeing word and bears the stamp of a spiritual sincerity greater, profounder, more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> than that of the intelligence.\n\nThe second power tries to go beyond this fine and perfect adequacy in its intensities, attempts a more rich or a more powerful expression, not merely sound and adequate to poetic vision, but dynamic and strongly effective. In prose also there is this difference and on its lower levels its attempt at effect takes the shape of rhetoric and appeals to a kind of nervous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of the intelligence but, when its mood is more intellectually deep and sincere, it prefers to arrive rather by subtler means, suggestive turn, aptness and vividness and richness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of phrase. Poetic speech follows the same methods but in another and higher manner and with a different atmosphere. There is indeed a poetic rhetoric which differs from prose rhetoric only in the same way as the lower kind of poetic adequacy differs from prose adequacy by just managing to bring in some element of rhythmic emotion and vision, and of this kind we may take an effective example from Pope,—\n\n>Atoms and systems into ruins hurled\nAnd now a bubble burst and now a world.\n\nA greater spirit and a less intellectual and more imaginative sincerity and elevation of thought, feeling and vision will give us a sublimer poetic rhetoric, as in certain lines of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> belonging to his more external manner,—\n\n>Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky\nWith hideous ruin and combustion down<span class='page-number' id='s-291' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.291]</span>\nTo bottomless perdition.\n\nAt a more temperate pitch and more capable of a certain subtlety of suggestion we can see the adequate changing into the more rhetorical poetic manner, as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> passages of Wordsworth,—\n\n>And oft when in my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> was heard\nThy timely mandate, I deferred\nThe task in smoother walks to stray.\n\nA richer, subtler and usually a truer poetic effectivity is attained not by this rhetorical manner, but through a language succeeding by apt and vivid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphor</span> and simile, richness and beauty of phrase or the forceful word that makes the mind see the body of the thought with a singularly living distinctness or energy of suggestion and nearness,—Wordsworth's\n\n>Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,\nLike twilight's too her dusky hair,\nBut all things else about her drawn\nFrom Maytime and the cheerful dawn:\n\nShelley's\n\n>    When hearts have once mingled,\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span> first leaves the well-built nest,\n    The weak one is singled\nTo endure what it once possessed;\n\nor\n\n>    Its passions will rock thee,\nAs the storms rock the ravens on high;\n    Bright reason will mock thee\nLike the sun from a wintry sky.\n\nIn this manner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry is especially opulent and gets from it much of its energy and power; but yet we feel that this is not the highest degree of which poetic speech is capable. There is a more intimate vision, a more penetrating spiritual emotion,<span class='page-number' id='s-292' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.292]</span> a more intense and revealing speech, to which the soul can be more vibrantly sensible.\n\nThis comes to its first self-discovery when either the adequate or the dynamically effective style is raised into a greater illumination in which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner mind</span> sees and feels object, emotion, idea not only clearly or richly or distinctly and powerfully, but in a flash or outbreak of transforming light which kindles the thought or image into a disclosure of new significances of a much more inner character, a more profoundly revealing vision, emotion, spiritual response. This illuminating poetic speech comes suddenly and rarely, as in Dryden's\n\n>And Paradise was opened in his face,\n\nbreaking out of a surrounding merely effective poetical eloquence, or intervening at times as in Shelley's\n\n>    The heart's echoes render\nNo song when the spirit is mute,\n    No song but sad dirges\nLike the wind through a ruined cell,\n\nwhere the effective force of image and feeling that makes us see and respond by a strong suggestion, at work throughout the rest of the lyric, passes now beyond itself into an illuminative closeness and then we feel, we bear, we ourselves live at the moment through the power of the poetic word the authentic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> of the experience. It comes in luminous phrases emerging from a fine and lucid adequacy and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> or the delicacy makes place for a lustrous profundity of suggestion, as in Shelley's\n\n>And now, alas! the poor sprite is\nImprisoned for some fault of his\nIn a body like a grave,\n\nor it strikes across a movement of strong and effective poetical thinking, as in Wordsworth's *Ode to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Duty</span>*,\n\n>Me this unchartered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> tires,\n\nor leaps up at once to set the tone of a poem,<span class='page-number' id='s-293' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.293]</span>\n\n>She was a phantom of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>\nWhen first she gleamed upon my sight,\nA lovely apparition sent\nTo be a moment's ornament.\n\nAnd supreme examples within the limits of this power which will bring out all their difference from the more common texture of poetry, may be taken from the same poets,—Shelley's\n\n>    The silent moon\nIn her interlunar swoon,\n\nand Wordsworth's\n\n>They flash upon the inner eye\nWhich is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of solitude.\n\nHere we get the pure illuminative speech of poetry not mixed with or arising out of the lucid adequate or the richly or forcefully effective or dynamic manner, but changed into an altogether supra-intellectual light of intuitive substance and vision and utterance.\n\nThe difference here we find to be an increasing intensity and finally a concentrated purity and fullness of the substance and language of intuitive expression. In the less intense styles the thing conveyed is indeed something suggested to and by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span>,—only the least inspired poetry is purely intellectual in substance,—but it is expressed with a certain indirectness or else with a dilution of the body of the intuitive light, and this is due to an intellectualised language or to the speech of an imagination which tries to bridge the gulf between the intuitive mind and the normal intelligence. The two powers seem to lean on and support each other, at a certain point are brought very close and even up to the point of fusion, and then suddenly the border is crossed, the difficulty of getting out through the doors of the mind the pure untranslated language of intuitive vision overcome and we have a word of intense light in which the intellect and its imagination count for nothing and the mind's language, even while remaining in material the same,<span class='page-number' id='s-294' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.294]</span> undergoes an unanalysable alchemy and spiritual change. And beyond this first language of intuitive illumination we arrive at a more uplifted range of an inspired poetic speech which brings to us not only pure light and beauty and inexhaustible depth, but a greater moved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of highest or largest thought and sight and speech and at its highest culminates in the inevitable, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> and revealing word. This too is sometimes a magical transformation of the adequate manner, as in Wordsworth's\n\n>A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard\nIn springtime from the cuckoo bird\nBreaking the silence of the seas\nAmong the farthest Hebrides—\n\nsometimes of the richer or more dynamic imaged style,\n\n><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Flowers</span> laugh before thee in their beds\nAnd fragrance in thy footing treads;\nThou dost preserve the stars from wrong;\nAnd the most ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> through thee are fresh and strong\n\n—and sometimes it is the illuminative speech powerfully inspired and rising suddenly into the highest revealing word,\n\n>The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep,\nNo more shall <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> of mine the season wrong,\nI hear the echoes through the mountains throng,\nThe winds come to me from the fields of sleep.\n\nThere the inspiration takes up the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of the poetic intelligence and imagination into a stirred <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of the speech of sight and in its last movement seems to leap even beyond itself and beyond any pursuit or touch of the intellect into a pure revelatory spiritual vision.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of the poet can do work of a high beauty or of a considerable greatness in any of these degrees of poetic speech, but it is the more purely intuitive, inspired or revelatory utterance that is the most rare and difficult for the human mind to command, and it is these kinds that we peculiarly value. Their power not only moves and seizes us the most, but it<span class='page-number' id='s-295' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.295]</span> admits the soul to a most spiritually profound light of seeing and ecstasy of feeling even of ordinary ideas and objects and in its highest force to thoughts and things that surpass the manner and range and limits of depth of the normal intelligence. The greatest poets have been those in whom these moments of a highest intensity of intuitive and inspired speech have been of a frequent occurrence and in one or two, as in Shakespeare, of a miraculous abundance. There is however this subtle farther variation that this kind of utterance, though essentially the same always, takes a different colour according to the kind of object vision and subjective vision which is peculiar to the mind of the poet in its normal action. The citations I have made have been all taken from writers in whom the poetic intelligence and its type of imagination have been the leading <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>. The same power in poets who speak more with the direct voice of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-soul</span> assumes quite another hue and seems even of a very different texture of language. The characteristic distinction of its note from that of the more intellectualised intuition can best be illustrated from Shakespeare and by such a passage as the speech of Claudio,\n\n>Ay, but to die and go we know not where;\nTo lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\nThis sensible warm motion to become\nA kneaded clod: and the delighted spirit\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\nIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;\nTo be imprisoned in the viewless winds\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\nThe pendant world:\n\nand the rest. There is an illumination, an intuitive intensity of the life spirit and its feeling in that thought and its speech which we can no longer command in the same direct and essential manner. And even the ideas that seem to belong to the region of the thinking intelligence have subtly in these poets the same inspiration. It is sufficient to compare Shakespeare's<span class='page-number' id='s-296' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.296]</span>\n\n>Life's but a walking shadow...\n            it is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing—\n\nand Shelley's voicing of a kindred idea of transience,\n\n>Heaven's light forever shines, earth's shadows fly;\nLife like a dome of many-coloured glass\nStains the white radiance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span>,\nUntil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> tramples it to fragments.\n\nThe one has the colour of an intuition of the life-soul in one of its intense moods and we not only think the thought but seem to feel it even in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> of mental sensation, the other is the thought mind itself uttering in a moved, inspired and illuminative language an idea of the pure intelligence. It would be difficult for the present human mind to recover the same spirit as moved Shakespeare's speech; it is nearer to that of the later poets and their voice of the brooding or the moved poetic intelligence or of the intuitive mind rising out of the intellect and still preserving something of its tones. Still the manner of the coming poetry is likely to recover and hold as its central secret something akin to the older poet, a greater straight impact and natural body of intuitive intensity, because it too will take up the thought and feeling into a concentrated expression of an equal though a different directness. It will be the language of a higher intuitive mind swallowing up the intellectual tones into the closenesses and identities of a supra-intellectual light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> poetry, assuming it to be of the kind I have suggested, its object to express some inmost truth of the things which it makes its subject, must to be perfectly adequate to its task express them in the inmost way, and that can only be done if, transcending the more intellectualised or externally vital and sensational expression, it speaks wholly in the language of an intuitive mind and vision and imagination, intuitive sense, intuitive emotion, intuitive vital feeling, which can seize in a<span class='page-number' id='s-297' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.297]</span> peculiarly intimate light of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> by a spiritual identity the inmost thought, sight, image, sense, life, feeling of that which it is missioned to utter. The voice of poetry comes from a region above us, a plane of our being above and beyond our personal intelligence, a supermind which sees things in their innermost and largest truth by a spiritual identity and with a lustrous effulgency and rapture and its native language is a revelatory, inspired, intuitive word limpid or subtly vibrant or densely packed with the glory of this ecstasy and lustre. It is the possession of the mind by the supramental touch and the communicated impulse to seize this sight and word that creates the psychological phenomenon of poetic inspiration and it is the invasion of it by a superior power to that which it is normally able to harbour that produces the temporary excitement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> and heart and nerve which accompanies the inrush of the influence. The inspired word comes, as said of old the Vedic seers, from the home of Truth, *sadanād ṛtasya*, the high and native level of a superior self which holds the light of a reality that is hidden by the lesser truth of the normal sense and intelligence. It is rarely however that it comes direct and unaltered, ready embodied and perfect and absolute: ordinarily there is an influx and a suggestion of its light and speech hidden in a cloud of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> lustre and we have to receive as best we can, to find and disengage or to reshape word and substance with the aid of our mental powers while they are still possessed and excited and enlightened by the influence. The word comes secretly from above the mind, but it is plunged first into our intuitive depths and emerges imperfectly to be shaped by the poetic feeling and intelligence, *hṛdā taṣṭaṁ manīṣā*. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive self</span> in the depth of each of our parts of being, hid in sense, life, heart, mind, is the transmitting agent, a subliminal power concealed in some secret cavern within of which the curtained and crystal doors disclose only occasional and partial transparencies or are sometimes half open or ajar,—*nihitaṁ guhāyām, guhāhitaṁ gahvareṣṭham*. The less we are near and awake to this agent, the more externally intellectualised and vitalised becomes the tone and substance of the poetic speech; the more we can bring in<span class='page-number' id='s-298' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.298]</span> of its direct power and vision, the more intuitive and illumined becomes the word of our utterance. And the more we can light up the veil and have the direct transmission, the greater the force of inspiration and revelation and the nearer we shall get to an absolute and inevitable word straight from the supramental sight and language.\n\nThe most characteristic trend of recent poetry has been an attempt, sometimes lucid, sometimes half understanding or obscure, to break open the doors of the luminous cavern and to get the seeing and phrase which would be that of this intuitive self of our intelligence and imagination and sensation and life and feeling. In a certain kind of continental poetry it is a search for the sheer intuitivities of sensation and of the more vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and states and experiences and relations with objects and persons, the spirit's sense of itself, as it were, externalised and made vital and physical and some illumination of the inner meaning of this externality, that motives a new kind of utterance. Much of present-day <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> drives in the same direction but with less subtlety and a more forceful outwardness of sight and tone. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Irish poets</span> and in a different way the few Indians, Tagore and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chattopadhyay</span> and Mrs. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Naidu</span>, who have written in English or transferred their poetical thought into that medium, aim at pure intuitivities of a more psychic feeling, sensation and life-vision or a subtle and psychic or spiritualised imagination and intelligence. All however are secretly moved to their very different and often contradictory tendencies by the same fundamental endeavour of the Time-spirit. The difficulty has been to find the intuitive language which will be the true medium and the condition of perfect success of this endeavour. The old habits of poetic speech still cling around and encrust or dilute the subtler subtlety, the more luminous light, the intenser intensities, the deeper depths sought for by the intuitive utterance. These things however are already there and are shaping a new manner of speech, a basis for the more inner and illumined poetic language of the future. At its best, and oftenest in the greater poets, it emerges from the admixture of older methods and manifests the whole and pure characteristic note of the intuitive manner. It is<span class='page-number' id='s-299' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.299]</span> the greatening, deepening and making normal of this kind that is likely to bring the perfect voice of the poetry of the future.\n\nThe character of this change is a raising of what I have called the adequate and the dynamic degrees of poetic speech to the third intuitive and illuminative power or a touching and penetrating of them with its peculiar lustre. The more potent inspired or revelatory inevitable word occasionally intervenes as in the older poets, but it is the greater generalising of the intermediate, the first more purely intuitive degree that is the common feature, the level of the endeavour, the distinctive stamp where it succeeds of this new utterance. It takes the clear and strong or the lucid and delicate poetical adequacy of speech from which the older poets started and takes too the dynamic poetical eloquence or the richer suggestive and imaginatively effective power of language and tries to effect commonly what they were content to do only in moments of greater elevation,—to put into its mould or even surcharge it with a stronger or subtler content of illumination and this also to discharge of the intellectual tone and colour which so usually holds or else makes its way into all but their rarest utterances and to arrive at a pure intuitive expression of sensation and feeling and thought or of an inwardly intuitive vital vision or of a strong or a subtle psychic or spiritualised intelligence. This is a language which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> at bare or strange or subtle or pregnant identities between the mind's intuitive thought and perception and emotion and a rarer than the surface truth and meaning of the object or experience. And very often the work is done not so much by the language as the subtle sense suggestion of the rhythm and word <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, the sound doing the alchemic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of transfiguration which the expression is not yet strong and adult enough to lead and compass.\n\nThese are beginnings and beyond lies much that has to be done to effectuate the complete change; an uncertain transition has yet to pass into a great transformation. The moulds or at least the spirit and manner of poetic expression have to be recast, very much as Shakespeare and his contemporaries recast the poetic speech of the English tongue so as to give shape and room to<span class='page-number' id='s-300' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.300]</span> the surge of self-seeing and self-feeling and self-thinking of the life soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>: but this time it has to be done in many <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> by the minds of many <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> entities at once and to make shape and room for the multitudinous vastitudes, the finer and finer subtleties, the absolute transparencies of the seeing, feeling, and thinking of the inmost self and spirit in man in intimate touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> truths of all the levels of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and all his surroundings in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> and in supernature. The voices we already have, the as yet strange and not yet universally accepted subtleties of some, the immature strainings and violences of others, the work of those who have something of the new substance but not a mastery of its native expression and those who have the new speech and rhythm but a poverty of the substance that should have made it rich and ample, the perfections attained even, are to be regarded only as incipient efforts and successes and stimulations to a more complete disclosure of the unfolding spirit. The speech that opens more constantly the doors of the intuitive self in the caverns of light of our nature has not done all that is to be done. The speech also has to be found that shall come by the rending or removal of the golden lid between our intelligence and the effulgent supra-intelligence and effect a direct and sovereign descent and pouring of some absolute sight and word of the spirit into the moulds of human language.<span class='page-number' id='s-301' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.301]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-word-and-the-spirit","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"The Future Poetry"}],"nxtt":"Conclusion","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/conclusion","prvt":"The Form and the Spirit","prvu":"/cwsa/26/the-form-and-the-spirit","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["conclusion"],"t":"Conclusion","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> has to solve, if the suggestions I have made are sound, a problem new to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of poetic speech, an utterance of the deepest soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and of the universal spirit in things, not only with another and a more complete vision, but in the very inmost language of the self-experience of the soul and the sight of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>.

It is a different and much larger creative and interpretative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> that we now see in its first stages, an expansion of the inner way of vision to outer no less than to inner things, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> that is subjective to us and all that is objective, a seeing by a closer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> in the self of man with the self of things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and Nature and of all that meets him in the universe. The poet has to find the language of these identities, and even symbol and figure, when brought in to assist the more direct utterance, must be used in a different fashion, less as a veil, more as a real correspondence.\n\nThe first condition of the complete emergence of this new poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and this vaster and deeper significance of<span class='page-number' id='s-302' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.302]</span> poetic speech must be the completion of an as yet only initial spiritualised turn of our general human feeling and intelligence. At present the human mind is occupied in passing the borders of two kingdoms. It is emerging out of a period of active and mostly materialistic intellectualism towards a primary intuitive seeking to which the straining of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> after truth has been brought in the very drive of its own impulse by a sort of slipping over unexpected borders. There is therefore an uncertain groping in many directions some of which are only valuable as a transitional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and, if they could be the end and final movement, might land us only in a brilliant corruption and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>decadence</span>. There is a vitalistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitivism</span> sometimes taking a more subjective, sometimes a more objective form, that lingers amid dubious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> on the border and cannot get through its own rather thick and often violent lustres and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>colours</span> to a finer and truer spiritual vision. There is an emotional and sensational psychical intuitivism half emerging from and half entangled in the vitalistic motive that has often a strange <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and brilliance, sometimes stained with morbid hues, sometimes floating in a vague mist, sometimes—and this is a common tendency—strained to an exaggeration of half vital, half psychic motive. There is a purer and more delicate psychic intuition with a spiritual issue, that which has been brought by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Irish poets</span> into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> literature. The poetry of Whitman and his successors has been that of life, but of life broadened, raised and illumined by a strong intellectual intuition of the self of man and the large soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. And at the subtlest elevation of all that has yet been reached stands or rather wings and floats in a high intermediate region the poetry of Tagore, not in the complete spiritual light, but amid an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> shot with its seekings and glimpses, a sight and cadence found in a psycho-spiritual heaven of subtle and delicate soul experience transmuting the earth tones by the touch of its radiance. The wide success and appeal of his poetry is indeed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the most significant signs of the tendency of the mind of the age. At the same time one feels that none of these things are at all the whole of what we are seeking or the definite outcome and issue. That can only be assured when<span class='page-number' id='s-303' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.303]</span> a supreme light of the spirit, a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and satisfaction of the subtlety and complexity of a finer psychic experience and a wide strength and amplitude of the life soul sure of the earth and open to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> have met, found each other and fused together in the sovereign unity of some great poetic discovery and utterance.\n\nIt is possible that it may be rather in Eastern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> and by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of Eastern poets that there will come the first discovery of this perfection: the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> has always had in its temperament a greater constant nearness to the spiritual and psychic sight and experience and it is only a more perfect turning of this sight on the whole life of man to accept and illuminate that is needed for the realisation of that for which we are still waiting. On the other hand the West has this advantage that though it is only now emerging not so much into the spiritual light as into an outer half-lit circle and though it is hampered by an excessive outward, intellectual and vital pressure, it has at present a more widely ranging thought and a more questing and active eye, and if these once take the right direction, the expression is not so much encircled by past spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and traditions. It is in any case the shock upon each other of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oriental</span> and occidental mentalities, on the one side the large spiritual mind and inward eye turned upon self and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> realities, on the other the free inquiry of thought and the courage of the life <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> assailing the earth and its problems that is creating the future and must be the parent of the poetry of the future. The whole of life and of the world and Nature seen, fathomed, accepted, but seen in the light of man's deepest spirit, fathomed by the fathoming of the self of man and the large self of the universe, accepted in the sense of its inmost and not only its more outward truth, the discovery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> reality within it and of man's own divine possibilities,—this is the delivering vision for which our minds are seeking and it is this vision of which the future poetry must find the inspiring aesthetic form and the revealing language.\n\nThe world is making itself anew under a great spiritual pressure, the old things are passing away and the new things ready to come into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>, and it may be that some of the old nations<span class='page-number' id='s-304' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.304]</span> that have been the leaders of the past and the old literatures that have been hitherto the chosen vehicles of strong poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> may prove incapable of holding the greater breath of the new spirit and be condemned to fall into decadence. It may be that we shall have to look for the future creation to new poetical literatures that are not yet born or are yet in their youth and first making or, though they have done something in the past, have still to reach their greatest voice and compass. A language passes through its cycle and grows aged and decays by many maladies: it stagnates perhaps by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> of its life to a past tradition and mould of excellence from which it cannot get away without danger to its principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> or a straining and breaking of its possibilities and a highly coloured decadence; or, exhausted in its creative vigour, it passes into that attractive but dangerous phase of art for art's sake which makes of poetry no longer a high and fine outpouring of the soul and the life but a hedonistic indulgence and dilettantism of the intelligence. These and other signs of age are not absent from the greater European literary tongues, and at such a stage it becomes a difficult and a critical experiment to attempt at once a transformation of spirit and of the inner cast of poetic language. There is yet in the present ferment and travail a compelling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of new potentiality, a saving element in the power that is at the root of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> to change, the power of the spirit ever strong to transmute life and mind and make all young again, and once this magical force can be accepted in its completeness and provided there is no long-continued floundering among perverted inspirations or half motives, the old literatures may enter rejuvenated into a new creative cycle.\n\nThe poetry of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span> in direct relation to which I have made these suggestions, has certain disadvantages for the task that has to be attempted but also certain signal advantages. It is a literature that has long done great things but has neither exhausted its great natural vigour nor fixed itself in any dominant tradition, but rather has constantly shown a free spirit of poetical adventure and a perfect readiness to depart from old moorings and set its sail to undiscovered countries. It<span class='page-number' id='s-305' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.305]</span> has an unsurpassed power of imaginative and intuitive language and has shown it to a very high degree in the intuitive expression of the life soul and to some degree in that of the inspired intelligence. It seems therefore a predestined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for the new poetic language of the intuitive spirit. The chief danger of failure arises from the external direction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span> mind. That has been a source of strength in combination with the finer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Celtic imagination</span> and has given <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> a strong hold on life, but the hold has been also something of a chain continually drawing it back from the height and fullness of some great spiritual attempt to inferior levels. Today however the language is no longer the tongue only of the English people: the Irish mind with its Celtic originality and psychic delicacy of vision and purpose has entered into this poetic field. It is receiving too for a time an element or at least an embassy and message from the higher spiritual mind and imagination of India. The countries <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the seas, still absorbed in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> making, have yet to achieve spiritual independence, but once that comes, the poetry of Whitman shows what large and new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> they can bring to the increase of the spiritual potentialities of the now wide-spreading language. On the whole therefore it is here among European tongues that there is the largest present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of the revolution of the human spirit finding most easily its poetic utterance. It is also here by the union of a great vital energy and a considerable possibility of the spiritual vision that there may be most naturally a strong utterance of that which most has to be expressed, the seen and realised unity of life and the spirit.\n\nThe pouring of a new and greater self-vision of man and Nature and existence into the idea and the life is the condition of the completeness of the coming poetry. It is a large setting and movement of life <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> a considerable expansion to the human soul and mind that has been in the great ages of literature the supreme creative stimulus. The discovery of a fresh intellectual or aesthetic motive of the kind that was common in the last century initiates only an ephemeral ripple on the surface and seldom creates work of the very first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>. The real inspiration enters with a more complete movement, an enlarged horizon of<span class='page-number' id='s-306' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.306]</span> life, a widening of the fields of the idea, a heightening of the flight of the spirit. The change that is at present coming over the mind of the race began with a wider <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> vision, a sense of the greatness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> and possibilities of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> and the race, the idea of humanity and of the unity of man with man and a closer relation too and unity of his mind with the life of Nature. It is the endeavour to make the expression of these things one with the expression of life that imparts to the poetry of Whitman so much more large and vital an air than the comparatively feeble refinement and careful art of most of the contemporary poetry of Europe—not that the art has to be omitted, but that it must be united with a more puissant sincerity of spirit and greatness of impulse and a sense of new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> and youth and the potencies of the future. The intellectual idea was yet not enough, for it had to find its own greater truth in the spiritual idea and its finer cultural field in a more delicate and complex and subtle psychic sight and experience. It is this that has been prepared by recent and contemporary poets. The expression of this profounder idea and experience is again not enough until the spiritual idea has passed into a complete spiritual realisation and not only affected individual intellect and psychic mind and imagination, but entered into the general sense and feeling of the race and taken hold upon all thought and life to reinterpret and remould them in their image.

It is not confined however to this sense, for it is extended to all speech that has a supreme or an absolute power; the Mantra is the word that carries the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> in it or the power of the godhead, can bring it into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and fix there it and its workings, awaken there the thrill of the infinite, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of something absolute, perpetuate the miracle of the supreme utterance. This highest power of speech and especially of poetic speech is what we have to make here the object of our scrutiny, discover, if we can, its secret, regard the stream of poetry as a long course of the endeavour of human speech to find it and the greater generalisation of its presence and its power as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> sign of an ultimate climbing towards an ultimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> as a poetic consciousness towards the conquest of its ultimate summits.<span class='page-number' id='s-313' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.313]</span>"}]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-reason-of-past-failures"],"t":"The Reason of Past Failures","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A definitive verdict seems to have been pronounced by the critical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> on the long-continued attempt to introduce quantitative metres into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poetry. It is evident that the attempt has failed, and it can even be affirmed that it was predestined to failure; quantitative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> is something alien to the rhythm of the language. Pure quantity, dependent primarily on the length or brevity of the vowel of the syllable, but partly also on the consonants on which the vowel sustains itself, quantity as it was understood in the ancient classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span>, is in the English tongue small in its incidence, compared with stress and accent, and uncertain in its rules; at any rate, even in the most capable hands it has failed to form a practicable basis of metre. Accentual metre is normal in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>, stress metres are possible, but quantitative metres can only be constructed by a *tour de <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>*; artificial and incapable of normality or of naturalisation, they cannot get a certified right of citizenship. If quantity has to be understood in that and no other sense, this verdict must stand; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> attempts made hitherto have been a failure, and not usually a brilliant failure. And yet this does not dispose of the question: an appeal is possible against the sentence of illegitimacy and banishment on the ground that from the very first the problem has been misunderstood and misstated, the methods used either a deviation from the true line or, even when close to it, a misfit; a better statement may lead to a solution that could well be viable.\n\nAt the very beginning of these attempts a double thesis was raised; two separate problems were closely associated together which are in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> distinct, although they can be brought<span class='page-number' id='s-317' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.317]</span> into close relation. There was, first, the problem of the naturalisation of classical metres in English poetry, and there was, mixed up with it, the problem of the free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of quantitative English verse in its own right, on its own basis, with its own natural laws, not necessarily <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> with those laid down in the ancient tongues. The main attempt then made was not to discover a true English principle of quantitative metre,—what was done was to bring in classical metres built according to the laws of quantity proper to a classical tongue but of doubtful validity in a modern language. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span>, influenced by mediaeval French and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italian poetry</span>, had naturalised their metrical inventions by making accentual pitch and inflexion the basis of English metre. This revolution succeeded because he had called to his aid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the most important <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> in the natural rhythm of the language and it was easy for him by that happy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> to establish a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> between this rhythm and his new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of metrical building. The metrical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> he perfected—for others before him had attempted it—passed easily into the language, because he caught and lifted its native rhythm into a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of sound captivating to the ear and moving to the inner witness and listener silent within us—the soul, to whom all art and all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> should appeal and minister. This great victory was essential for the free flowering of poetry in the English tongue; the absence of any such *coup d'œil* of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> was one chief reason of its failure to flower as freely in so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> human languages,—no creative genius found for them the route which leads to the discovery of a perfect plasticity of word and sound, a perfect expressiveness, a perfect beauty of rhythm. But with the Renaissance came a new impulse, a new influence; an enthusiasm was vividly felt by many for the greatness of structure and achievement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Latin tongues</span>—an achievement far surpassing anything done in the mediaeval Romance languages—and a desire arose to bring this greatness of structure and achievement into English poetry. As Chaucer by the success of the accentual structure in verse and his discovery of its true and natural rhythm was able to bring in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> and fluidity of the Romance tongues, so they too<span class='page-number' id='s-318' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.318]</span> conceived that the best way to achieve their aim was to bring in the greatness of classical harmony and the nobility and beauty of Greek and Latin utterance by naturalising the quantitative metres of Virgil, Ovid, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Horace</span>. It was also natural that some of these innovators should conceive that this could be best done by imposing the classical laws of quantity wholesale on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>.\n\nAt the first attempt a difference of view on this very point arose; there was a bifurcation of paths, but neither of these branchings led anywhere near the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>. One led nowhere at all, there was a laborious trudging round in a futile circle; the other turned straight back towards accentual metre and ended in the entire abandonment of the quantitative principle. Spenser in his experiments used all his sovereign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to force English verse into an unnatural classical mould, Sidney followed his example. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Harvey</span> thought, rightly enough, that an adaptation to the natural rhythm of English was indispensable, but he failed to take more than a first step towards the right path; after him, those who followed his line could not get any farther,—in the end, in place of the attempt at quantitative verse, there was an adaptation of classical metres to the accentual system. Some who still experimented with quantity, feeling the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of making their verse normally readable, did this by taking care that their long quantities and stress or accentual pitch, wherever these came in, coincided as far as possible. But the result was not encouraging; it made the verse readable indeed, but stiff <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> measure. Even Tennyson in his lines on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span>, where he attempts this combination, seems to be walking on stilts,—very skilfully and nobly, but still on stilts and not on his own free God-given feet. As for other attempts which followed the Spenserian line of approach, they can best be described in Tennyson's own language—\n\n>Barbarous hexameters, barbarous pentameters\n\n—and the alcaics, sapphics and galliambics were no better. A metre which cannot be read as normal English is read, in which light syllables are forced to carry a voice-weight which they<span class='page-number' id='s-319' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.319]</span> have no strength to bear and strong stresses are compelled to efface themselves while small insignificant sounds take up their burden, is not a real and natural verse movement; it is an artificial structure which will never find an agreed place in the language.\n\nNo make-believe can reconcile us to such rhythms as Sidney's\n\n![Image 1](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-reason-of-past-failures-a.jpg)\n\nHere two intractably iambic feet followed by a resolutely short syllable are compelled to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dance</span> a jig garbed as two spondees followed by a solitary long syllable; so disguised, they pretend to be the first half of a pentameter,—the second half with its faultless and natural metre and rhythm is of itself a condemnation of its predecessor. Neither can one accept <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bridges</span>'\n\n![Image 2](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-reason-of-past-failures-b.jpg)\n\nwhere length is forced on an inexorable short like the \"ing\" of \"flushing\" and \"crowding\" and a pretence is made that an accentual iamb, \"of Spring\", can be transformed into a quantitative spondee. Still worse, still more impossible to digest or even to swallow, is his forced <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span> ending,\n\n>thĕ sĕ|rēnelў sŏ|lēmn spēlls. |\n\nThere two successive accentual trochees and a terminal long syllable are turned by force or by farce into a closing dactyl and spondee. Such are the ungainly antics into which the natural movements of verse have to be compelled in this game of thrusting the laws of quantity of an ancient language upon a modern tongue which has quite another spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. What is possible and natural in a clear-cut ancient language where there is a more even distribution of the voice and both the short and long syllables can get their full sound-value, is impossible or unnatural in the English tongue; for there the alternation of stresses with unstressed short and light sounds is a constant and inescapable feature. That makes all the difference; it turns this kind of verse into a frolic of false quantities. In any case,<span class='page-number' id='s-320' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.320]</span> the method has invariably resulted in failure from Spenser to Bridges; the greatness of some of the poets who have made this too daring and unnatural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, has not been great enough to bring success to an impossible adventure.\n\nThere remains the alternative way, the adaptation of classical metres to the accentual mould, of which the accentual hexameter is the not too successful consequence; but this is not a solution of the problem of English quantitative verse. Even if successful, in every field and not only in the treatment of the hexameter, it would have only solved the other quite distinct problem of naturalising Greek and Latin metres in English. But even in this direction success has been either nil or partial and defective. The experiments have always remained experiments; there has been no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of new paths, no new rhythmic discoveries or triumphant original creations. The writers carry with them very evidently the feeling of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> experimenters in an abnormal kind; they achieve an artificial rhythm, their very language has an artificial ring: there is always a stamp of manufacture, not a free outflow of significant sound and harmonious word from the depths of the spirit. A poet trying to naturalise in English the power of the ancient hexameter or to achieve a new form of its greatness or beauty natural to the English tongue must have absorbed its rhythm into his very blood, made it a part of himself, then only could he bring it out from within him as a self-expression of his own being, realised and authentic. If he relies, not on this inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>, but solely on his technical ability for the purpose, there will be a failure; yet this is all that has been done. There have been a few exceptions like Swinburne's magnificent sapphics; but these are isolated triumphs, there has been no considerable body of such poems that could stand out in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span></span> as a new form perfectly accomplished and accepted. This may be perhaps because the attempt was always made as a sort of leisure exercise and no writer of great genius like Spenser, Tennyson or Swinburne has made it a main part of his work; but, more probably, there is a deeper cause inherent in the very principle and method of the endeavour.\n\nTwo poets, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Clough</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Longfellow</span>, have ventured on a<span class='page-number' id='s-321' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.321]</span> considerable attempt in this kind and have succeeded in creating something like an English hexameter; but this was only a half accomplishment. The rhythm that was so great, so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> or, at the lowest, so strong or so happy in the ancient tongues, the hexameter of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> and Virgil, the hexameter of Theocritus, the hexameter of Horace and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Juvenal</span> becomes in their hands something poor, uncertain of itself and defective. There is here the waddle and squawk of a big water-fowl, not the flight and challenge of the eagle. Longfellow was an admirable literary craftsman in his own limits, the limits of ordinary metre perfectly executed in the ordinary way, but his technique like his poetic inspiration had no subtlety and no power. Yet both subtlety and power, or at the very least one of these greater qualities, are imperatively called for in the creation of a true and efficient English hexameter; it is only a great care and refinement or a great poetic force that can overcome the obstacles. Longfellow had his gift of a certain kind of small perfection on his own level; Clough had <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, some drive of language, often a vigorous if flawed and hasty force of self-expression. It cannot be said that their work in this line was a total failure; \"The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich\", \"Evangeline\" and \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" have their place, though not a high place, in English poetry. But the little they achieved was not enough to acclimatise the hexameter permanently in English soil; nor did their work encourage others to do better, on the contrary the imperfection of its success has been a deterrent, not an incentive.\n\nIt is probable indeed that the real reason of the failure went much deeper; it lay in the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the mould they invented. The accentual hexameter was a makeshift and could not be the true thing; its false plausibility could not be an equivalent for the great authentic rhythms of old, its mechanically regular beat, common, uninspiring, sometimes stumbling or broken, is something quite different from the powerful sweep, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> rush or the assured truth of tread of that greater word-music. The hexameter is a quantitative verse or nothing; losing the element of quantity, it loses also its quality. Admitting that quantity as it is ordinarily understood cannot be the sole basic element in<span class='page-number' id='s-322' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.322]</span> any English metre, yet for the hexameter, perhaps for any classical rhythm, the discovery and management of true quantity is an intimate part of its technique; to neglect or to omit it is to neglect or omit something essential, indispensable. Accentual pitch gives beat, but its beat does not depend on quantity except in so far as the stress ictus creates a genuine length valid for any rhythm which is native to the language. To find out what does constitute true quantity is the first need, only then can there be any solution of the difficulty. Tennyson, like Harvey, missed this necessity; he was content to fuse long syllable and stress and manage carefully his short quantities conceived according to the classical law; this he did admirably, but two or three efforts in this kind of tightrope acrobatics were as much as he cared to manage. But true quantity in English must be something else; it must be something inherent in the tongue, recognisable everywhere in its rhythm,—not an artifice or convention governing its verse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> alone, but a technique of Nature flowing spontaneously through the very texture of the language as a whole.<span class='page-number' id='s-323' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.323]</span>","url":"/cwsa/26/the-reason-of-past-failures","volt":"The Future Poetry","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"26","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Future Poetry","u":"/cwsa/26"},{"t":"On Quantitative Metre"},{"t":"On Quantitative Metre"}],"nxtt":"Metre and the Three Elements of English Rhythm","nxtu":"/cwsa/26/metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm","prvt":"Appendixes to The Future Poetry","prvu":"/cwsa/26/appendixes-to-the-future-poetry","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm"],"t":"Metre and the Three Elements of English Rhythm","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"There are three <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> which constitute the general exterior <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of rhythm in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language,—accent, stress, quantity.

But in practice accent and stress combining with it and aiding it have alone successfully dominated English verse-form; intrinsic quantity has been left to do what it can for itself under their rule. The basis commonly adopted in most <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> since <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaucer</span> is the accentual rhythm, the flow of accentual pitch and inflexion which is so all-important an element in the intonation of English speech. In any common form of English poetry we find <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> based on pitch and inflexion; the feet are accentual feet, the metrical \"length\" or \"shortness\" of syllables—not their inherent quantity—is determined by natural or willed location<span class='page-number' id='s-323' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.323]</span> of a pitch of accent or some helping inflexion falling on the main supporting syllable of the foot and by the absence of any such pitch or accentual inflexion on those that are subordinate and supported: the main accented syllables are supposed to be metrically long, the subordinate unaccented short, there is no other test or standard. To take a familiar example:\n\n![Image 3](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-a.jpg)\n\n[^1]Here there is a regular iambic beat determined by the persistent accentual high pitch or low pitch falling on the second syllable of the foot. In a stress scansion the second foot of the second line would rank not as an iamb but as a pyrrhic, for it is composed of two short unstressed syllables; but there is the minor accentual inflexion which commonly occurs as a sort of stepping-stone helping the voice across a number of unstressed syllables; that, slight as it is, is sufficient to justify in accentual theory the description of this foot as an iamb. Stress usually coincides with the high accentual pitch and is indispensable as the backbone of the rhythm, but it was not treated until recently either as an independent or as the main factor. Inherent quantity is not at all regarded; long-syllable quantity sometimes coincides with both high pitch and stress, sometimes it stands by itself as a rhythmic element, but that makes no difference to the metre.\n\n[^1]: The sign / indicates the accentual high pitch, the sign  the transitional inflexion, unobtrusive and without stress or with only a half-stress.\n\nThe instance given is an example of the iambic verse with an extreme, an almost mechanical regularity of beat; so, for completeness, we may turn to poetry of a freer and larger type.\n\n![Image 4](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-b.jpg)\n\nHere there are two glide-anapaests in the first line, an initial dactyl in the second,—three departures from the regular iambic<span class='page-number' id='s-324' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.324]</span> beat. Such liberty of variation can always be indulged in English verse and it is sometimes pushed to much greater lengths—as in the line\n\n![Image 5](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-c.jpg)\n\nwhere there is only one iamb in the five feet of the line; the other four feet are respectively a trochee, a bacchius, a pyrrhic and a closing spondee. Nevertheless the basic system of the metre or at least some form of its spirit asserts itself even here by a predominant beat on the final syllable of most of the feet: all the variations are different from each other, none predominates so as to oust and supplant the iamb in its possession of the metric base. In Webster's line this forceful irregularity is used with a remarkable skill and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>; the two first feet are combined in a choriamb to bring out a vehemence of swift and abrupt unexpressed emotion; in the rest intrinsic quantitative longs combine with short-vowel stress lengths to embody a surcharged feeling—still unexpressed—in a strong and burdened <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>: all is divided into three brief and packed word-groups to bring out by the subtly potent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of the rhythm the overpowering yet suppressed reactions of the speaker. The language used, however vivid in itself, could not have done as much as it does, if it were deprived of this sound-effect; it would have given the idea by its external indices, but it is the rhythm that brings out the concealed feeling. Each word-group has a separate rhythm, an independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, yet it is by following each other rapidly in a single whole that the three together achieve a complete force and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. If the three clauses of this line were cut up into successive lines in modern free-verse fashion, they would lose most of their beauty; it is the total rhythmic power of these three hammer-strokes that brings to the surface all that underlies the words. But without the aid of the unusual arrangements of stress and quantity it could not have been done.\n\nThis shows up the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the accentual system as distinguished from its formal theory. It becomes clear that the supposed longs and shorts constituting its feet are not real quantities, they are not composed of long and short syllables,—on<span class='page-number' id='s-325' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.325]</span> the contrary, a very short sound can be made to bear the weight of the whole foot while longer ones trail after it in dependence on their diminutive leader. What we really have is a system of recurrent strokes or beats intervening at a fixed place in each foot, while the syllables which are not hammered into prominent place by this kind of stroke or beat fill the interspaces. A regular metrical base is thus supplied, but the rhythm can be varied or modulated by departures from the base—from it but always upon it; for these departures, variations or modulations, relieve its regularity which might otherwise become monotonous, but do not replace or frustrate the essential rhythm. If the modulations overlay too much the basic sound-system so as to obliterate it or if they are so ill-managed as to substitute another rhythm for it, then we have a rhythmic mixture; or else there is a break of the metrical movement which can be legitimate only if it is done with set purpose and justified by the success of that purpose.\n\nIn all these instances it will be seen that inherent quantity combined with distribution of stress—which is also as we shall see a true quantity-builder—plays always the same role; it is used as an accessory or important element of the rhythm, to give variety, subtlety, deeper significance. A longer quotation may illustrate this position and function of stress distribution and distribution of quantity in accentual metre with more amplitude—\n\n![Image 6](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-d.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-326' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.326]</span>\n\n[^2]The first six lines of this passage owe much of their beauty to the unusual placing of the stresses and the long-vowelled syllables; in each line the distribution differs and creates a special significant rhythm which deepens and reinforces the outward sense and adds to it that atmosphere of the unexpressed reality of the thing in itself which it is in the power of rhythm, of wordmusic as of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, to create. In the first line two pyrrhics separate the two long-vowelled sounds which give emphasis and power to the first and last feet from the narrower shortvowel stressed foot in the middle: this gives a peculiar rhythmic effect which makes the line no longer a mere enumerative statement, it evokes three different rhythmic significances isolating and locating each of the three pure Imaginatives in his own kind. In the second line a swift short movement in its first half slows down to a heavy prolonged movement in its second, a swift run with a long and tangled consequence; here too the expressiveness of the rhythm is evident. In the third line there are no fewer than four long vowels and a single pyrrhic separates two rhythmic movements of an unusual power and amplitude expressive of the enormity of the lunatic's vision and imagination; here too, short-vowel stress and intrinsic-quantity longs are combined no less than three times and it is this accumulation that brings about the effect. In the fifth and sixth lines the separative pyrrhic in the middle serves again a similar purpose. In the fifth it helps to isolate in contrast two opposites each emphasised by its own significant rhythm. In the sixth line there are again four long vowels and a very expressive combination of shortvowel stressed length with intrinsic long syllables, a spacious amphibrach like a long plunge of a wave at the end; no more<span class='page-number' id='s-327' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.327]</span> expressive rhythm could have been contrived to convey potently the power, the excitement and the amplitude of the poet's vision.[^3] Afterwards there follow five lines of a normal iambic movement, but still with a great subtlety of variation of rhythm and distribution of quantity creating another kind of rhythmic beauty, a beauty of pure harmonious word-music, but this too is the native utterance of the thing seen and conveys by significant sound its natural atmosphere. This passage shows us how much the metrically unrecognised element of intrinsic quantity can tell in poetic rhythm bringing real significations into what would be otherwise only sheer beauty of sound; quantity is one among its most important elements, even though it is not reckoned in the constitution of the metre. It combines with stress distribution to give power and expressive richness to the beat or, as it has been called, the strokes and flicks of accentual verse.\n\n[^2]: Here only the stresses are marked, by the sign |, and the long-vowel syllables, by the sign ¯; the quantitative shorts are left unmarked: the accents need no indication.\n\n[^3]: A combination of powerful intrinsic longs and equally powerful short-vowel stresses help to create two of the most famous \"mighty lines\" of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Marlowe</span>,—\n\n  ![Image 7](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-e.jpg)\n\nIt has been seen that accentual high pitch and stress most frequently coincide;—indeed, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> refuse to make any distinction between stress of accent and stress proper. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> is so close that all the passages cited—and accentual verse generally—can, if we so choose, be scanned by stress instead of accentual inflexion. But that at once brings in a difference: for the lesser accentual inflexions have then to be ignored because they do not carry in them anything that can be called a stress; as a result, syllables which are treated as long in the conventional scansion because of this slight accentual help have now, since they are unstressed, to be regarded as short. Iambs, so reputed, cease, in this reckoning, to be iambs and become pyrrhics; an iambic pentameter has often to be read in the stress scansion as an imperfectly iambic stress verse because of the frequent modulations, trochee or pyrrhic, anapaest, amphibrach or spondee. But apart from this, there can be a more independent stress principle of metre; for, properly speaking, stress means not accentual high<span class='page-number' id='s-328' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.328]</span> pitch, but weight of voice emphasis; it is a brief hammer-stroke of the voice from above which comes down on a long-vowel or a short-vowel syllable and gives even to the latter a metrical length and power which, when without stress, it does not naturally have. This stroke can thus confer metrical length even on a very short vowel or slightest short syllable, because it drives it firmly in like a nail into the wall, so that other unstressed sounds can hang loosely upon it. This provides a distinctive soundframe which can be generalised and so made into a metrical base.\n\nThere can then be a pure stress scansion and pure stress metres in their own right without any justification by accent. For in stress metre proper the high accentual pitches are swallowed up into stress; any other rise or fall of accentual inflexion is ignored,—it is allowed to influence the rhythm but it does not determine or affect the basic metrical structure. Accent can in this way disappear altogether as a metrical base; stress replaces it. Here, for example, are lines composed entirely of stress paeons—\n\n![Image 8](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-f.jpg)\n\nIt is evident that here there are accentual inflexions other than those taken up into stress, on one syllable even a low pitch, but because they are not reckoned as stresses, they do not count in the metrical structure of the lines. Or there may be a still freer stress metrification which rejects any scheme of regular feet and refuses to recognise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a fixed number of syllables either to the foot or the line; it regards only the fall of the stress and is faithful to that measure alone.\n\n![Image 9](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-g.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-329' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.329]</span>\n\nThe line is divided into three word-groups; the first contains two stresses, the others carry each three stresses, but the beats are distributed at pleasure: sometimes they are close together, sometimes they stand separated by far intervals amid a crowd of short unstressed syllables. Sometimes there is a closely packed movement loosening itself at the end,—\n\n![Image 10](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-h.jpg)\n\nSometimes a loose run gathers itself up in its close into a compact movement:\n\n![Image 11](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-metre-and-the-three-elements-of-english-rhythm-i.jpg)\n\nOr any other movement can be chosen which is best suited to the idea or the feeling of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> line. Quantity as such is here immaterial for metre building; it is of value only in so far as it coincides with stress and gives it an ampler fullness of metrical length so as to build and sustain more strongly the rhythmic totality of the line and the stanza.\n\nBut what then of this third element, quantity? Its importance is evident, but it does not form by itself the backbone of the natural rhythm of the language; quantity in English seems to intervene only as a free element taking its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> part in the general movement or its place assigned at will in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>architecture</span>. And yet quantity of some kind, shorts, longs, intermediate sounds, is ubiquitous and there seems to be no reason why it should not regulate metre. Indeed, every system affirms some kind of quantity as its constituent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>. Stress metre arranges its rhythms by taking all stressed syllables as long, all unstressed syllables as metrically short; accent affirms similarly its own principle of quantity, though here the word seems to be a misnomer. Can then quantity properly speaking, pure quantity, stand by itself as the whole basis of a metrical system, as accent and stress have done? Can it similarly leave the other two<span class='page-number' id='s-330' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.330]</span> elements, stress and accent, to influence and vary the rhythm but not allow them to interfere in the building of the metre? Can there be in English poetry a quantitative as well as an accentual or a stress building of verse, natural to the turn of the language, recognised and successful? and must stress or accentual lengths in such a metrical system be excluded from the idea of length? For everything here depends upon what we understand by quantity; if stress lengths are admitted, the problem of quantitative metre loses its difficulty, otherwise it seems insoluble.\n\nThe experimenters in pure quantitative verse have excluded stress from their theory of metrical lengths; they have admitted only intrinsic lengths determined by the vowel of the syllable and positional lengths determined by the number of succeeding consonants. That there is a fundamental falsity in this theory is shown by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that their lines cannot be read; or else in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to make them readable, an unnatural weight has to be thrown on sounds that are too slender to bear it; a weird sound-system full of false values is artificially created. But stress is a main, if not the main, feature of English rhythm; a metrical method ignoring it is impracticable. A pure quantitative verse of this manufacture has therefore to be ruled out, both because of its intrinsic artificiality and its unsuccessful result; it has to be abandoned as impossible or as inherently false. Those experimenters who avoid these false values and try to get rid of the difficulty by allowing only those stresses which coincide with intrinsic and positional longs, are on firmer ground and have some chance of arriving at something practicable. But their efforts too are hampered by the classical theory that the support of more than one consonant after a short vowel is sufficient to make short syllables metrically long, a statement which is true of the classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> but not true of English. This either leads them into the introduction of false quantities which cannot stand the test of natural reading or drives them to oblige their longs and shorts to coincide with accentual or stress longs and shorts. Thus we<span class='page-number' id='s-331' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.331]</span> see quantitative feet come to coincide exactly or predominantly with stress or accentual feet in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Harvey</span>'s <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span> verse,—\n\n>Fāme wĭth ă|būndānce | mākĕth ă | mān thrīce | blēssĕd ănd[^4] | hāppў. |\n\n[^4]: The word *and* here ought by the classicist theory to be long because of its two consonants after the vowel and still longer because it is further supported by the initial *h* of *happy*.\n\nIn Sidney's line\n\n>These be her words, but a woman's words to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> that is eager\n\nthere happens to be a similar predominant identification of quantity with accent or stress and it is this that makes the line readable.

But the voice-weight on a vowel is determined in three different ways. There is a dwelling of the voice, a horizontal weight-bar laid across the syllable, or there is its rapid passing, an absence of the weight-bar: that difference decides its natural length, it creates the inherent or intrinsic long or short, ![Image 13](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-a.jpg) There is, again, a vertical ictus weight of the voice, the hammer-stroke of stress on the syllable; that of itself makes even a short-vowel syllable metrically long, as in ![Image 14](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-b.jpg);[^1] the short-vowel syllables that have not the lengthening ictus or vertical weight and have not, either, the horizontal weight of the voice upon them remain light and therefore short. It is evident that these words are respectively a natural dactyl, second paeon, trochee, iamb, yet all their syllables are short, apart from the stress; but what true rhythm or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> could treat as other than long these stressed short-vowel syllables? In the words, ![Image 15](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-c.jpg) we see this triple power of length at work within <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> word,—weight-bar long syllables stressed or unstressed, hammer-stroke-weighted shortvowel longs, natural unweighted short syllables. It is clear that there can be no true reduction of stressed or unstressed or of intrinsic long or short to a sole one-kind principle; both stress and vowel length work together to make a complex but harmonious system of quantity. But, yet again, there is a third factor of length-determination; there is consonantal weight, a lingering or retardation of the voice compelled by a load of consonants, or there is a free unencumbered light <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. This distinction creates the positionally long syllable, short by its vowel but lengthened by its consonants, *strēngth, swīft, ābstrāct*; where there is no such weight or no sufficient weight<span class='page-number' id='s-333' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.333]</span> of consonants buttressing up the short syllable, it remains short, unless lengthened by stress.

To the ear it stands out that the feet in Webster's line, ![Image 17](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-e.jpg) are, quantitatively, bacchius[^2] and spondee; the one is not and cannot be a true anapaest, as it would or can be accounted by convention in accentual scansion, the other is not and cannot be either iamb or trochee. The stress long naturally combines here with the intrinsic long to make bacchius or spondee, because it has itself a true metrical length which is quivalent to that of the long-vowel syllable, though not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. This stress length, in any valid theory of quantity, cannot be ignored; its ictus weight and the conveyed force of length which the weight carries with it cannot be whittled down to shortness by any mental decree. In accentual verse its power is usually absorbed by coincidence with accentual high pitch and so it is satisfied and does not need to put in a separate claim; but in quantitative verse too it insists on its right and, if denied, fatally disturbs by its presence the rhythm that tries to disown or ignore it. In true quantitative verse, stress lengths and intrinsic lengths can and must be equally accepted because they both carry weight enough to burden the syllable with an enhanced sound-value. The admission or generalisation of the idea of weight lengths clears up <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> cobwebs and, because it corresponds with the facts, provides us with a rational system of quantitative verse.\n\n[^2]: Unless we consider *my* as long, which is a disputable point; the sound is inherently a long-vowel one, but depressed by the absence of stress or accentual high pitch. In quantitative verse this should not matter; it can retain in spite of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span> its native dignity as a long-vowel syllable.\n\nWhat difficulty remains arises from the theory drawn from<span class='page-number' id='s-334' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.334]</span> the classical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> that a sequence of more than one consonant after a short vowel—whether in the word itself or with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of an initial consonant or consonants in the word that follows—compensates for the shortness and gives the syllable, inexorably, a value of metrical length. This is palpably untrue, as has already been shown by the stumbles of Sidney and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bridges</span> and every other classicist operator in quantitative verse. Let us again consult the ear, not the theorising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>; what is its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> on this point if we listen, for instance, to these four <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span> lines based on natural and true quantity?\n\n![Image 18](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-f.jpg)\n\nAccording to the classical theory words and syllables like \"and\", \"of\", \"in\", \"the\", \"he\", \"ing\" should be treated as long since or when two or three consonants come immediately after the vowel within the line. But this is quite false; the \"dr\" of \"driver\" does not as a matter of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> make the \"the\" before it long; the natural shortness of \"with\" is not abolished by the \"h\" of the following word \"his\", or the shortness of \"his\" by the \"d\" of \"decades\". All these small light words are so intrinsically short, so light in their very nature, that nothing, or nothing short of an unavoidable stress, can force quantitative length or weight of sound upon them. Even the short \"i\"s and short \"a\" of \"insignificant\" and the short \"e\" of \"feeblest\" retain their insignificance and feebleness in spite of the help of the two consonants occurring after them,—the voice passes too swiftly away for any length to accrue before it has left them; there is no weight, no dwelling or lingering upon them sufficient to give them a greater soundvalue. It would be a strange and extravagant prosody that could<span class='page-number' id='s-335' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.335]</span> scan the first line—\n\n>Ōne ānd ŭn|ārmed īn thĕ | cār wās thē | drīvēr; | grēy wās hē, | shrūnkĕn,\n\nthough it might still scan as a hexameter with antibacchius and molossus twice repeated as modulations in place of the dactyl; but it could not be read aloud in that way,—the ear would immediately contradict the arbitrary dictates of the eye and the inapplicable rigidity of the mental theory.\n\nThis is not to deny that an additional consonant or consonants within the word after and before the vowel do give greater length to the syllable as a whole; but this does not necessarily transfer it from the category of shorts to the category of longs. At most, when the weight of consonants is not heavy and decisive, it makes it easier for these midway sounds to figure as lengthened shorts; it helps a trochee to serve as a substitute modulation for a spondee but it does not transform it into a spondee. To take an instance from a hexameter movement—\n\n>Wind in the forests, bees in the grove,—spring's ardent cymbal\nThrilling, the cry of the cuckoo.\n\nHere the word \"ardent\" easily replaces a dactyl or spondee as a modulation, but it remains trochaic. There is more possibility of treating \"forests\" here with its three heavy consonants as a spondee,—a possibility, not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> invariable in all places, for one could very well write \"in the forests of autumn\", in spite of the three consonants, as the orthodox dactylic close of a hexameter. Let us try again with yet another example, this time of wholly or fundamentally dactylic hexameters,—\n\n>Onward from continent sailing to continent, ever from harbour\nHasting to harbour, a wanderer joining[^3] ocean to ocean.<span class='page-number' id='s-336' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.336]</span>\n\n[^3]: This word is a trochaic modulation; it is not intended to figure as a spondee.\n\nHere the word \"continent\" clearly does not become a cretic, even when a third consonant follows like the \"s\" of \"sailing\", still less when a vowel follows; a slight weight is there, but it is altogether insufficient to hamper the pure dactylic flow of the line.\n\nIt is only a sufficient consonant weight that can change the category; but even then the result depends less on the number than on the power and heaviness of the consonants composing the word; the theory that it is the number of consonants that determines metrical length cannot stand always. Thus the word *strength* or the word *stripped* is long wherever it may occur, but *string* with its five consonant sounds is long mainly by the voice ictus falling on it; where that lacks it may remain short by the inherent value of its vowel: *heart-string, hamstring* sound more natural as trochees than as spondees; *hamstringing* carries weight as a dactyl, it is too weak to be a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> antibacchius. In these matters it is always the ear that must judge, there can be no rule of thumb or fixed mathematical measure determinable by the eye of the reader; it is the weight or lightness of the syllable, the slowed down or unencumbered rapid passage of the voice, the pressure or slightness of its step in passing that makes the difference, and of that the ear alone can be the true judge or arbiter.\n\nIn any case it is only the internal consonants that matter; for it is doubtful whether initial consonants in a word that follows can, even when they are many, radically influence the quantity of a preceding syllable. This rule of backward influence could prevail in the classical tongues because there the voice was more evenly distributed over the words; this evenness gave a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> to the short syllables to have their full sound-value and a slight addition of consonantal sound might overweight them and give them, either internally or in position, a decisive length value. Intrinsic quantity also was not crushed under the weight of stress as in English and turned into a secondary factor,—it was and remained a prime factor in the rhythm. There is accentual pitch and inflexion, but it does not take the first place. Thus the first lines of the Aeneid,—<span class='page-number' id='s-337' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.337]</span>\n\n![Image 19](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-g.jpg)\n\nif they were read like an English line, would become some kind of irregular and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> accentual hexameter,—\n\n![Image 20](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-h.jpg)\n\nstress would preside and quantity fall into a subordinate second place. If this did not and could not happen, it was evidently because the accent was an inflexion or pitch of the voice and not stress, not an emphatic pressure.[^4] In English stress or voice emphasis predominates and there is a very uneven distribution of sound-values in which quantity is partly determined and, where not determined, considerably influenced by stress; it has some difficulty in asserting its full independent value. Moreover the words do not cohere or run into each other as in a Sanskrit line, (this cohesion was the *raison d'être* of the complicated law of Sandhi by which the closing letter of one word so frequently unites with the initial letter of its successor in a conjunct sound); each word in English is independent and has its own metrical value unaffected by the word that follows. In Sanskrit, as in Latin and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span>, the short syllable having already its full natural sound-value is affected by the additional consonant and passes<span class='page-number' id='s-338' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.338]</span> into the category of longs by the force of the consonant weightage, but these conditions are not naturally present in English verse.\n\n[^4]: In the Latin metre accent and quantity coincide in the last two feet but not in the earlier four feet; the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Harvey</span> type of hexameter has been criticised for not following this rule, but the writers had no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>,—to do otherwise would have brought in the conflict between stress and quantity which for the reason here stated could not occur in Latin. In the English hexameter accent, stress and quantity have inevitably to fuse together in the main long syllable of the foot; relief from a too insistent beat has to be sought by other natural means or technical devices, modulation, the greater value given to long unstressed syllables, variation of foot-grouping, pause, caesura.\n\nThere is therefore no good reason, or at least no essential reason, for the admission of a rule allowing or obliging a throwback of influence from a following word upon its predecessor. In accentual or stress metre no such rule prevails,—one never thinks of this element in arranging one's line; there is nothing that compels its adoption in quantitative verse. If these initial consonants created an obstacle to the pace of the voice sufficient to make it linger or pause, then such an effect would be justified,—the closing short syllable of the preceding word would or might be lengthened: but, normally, the obstacle is so slight that it is not felt and the voice takes it in its stride and passes on without any slackening or with only a slight slackening of its pace. The distinctness of each word from another does not, indeed, create any gap or pause, but it is strong enough to preserve for it its independence, its separate self-value in the total rhythm of the line, the word-group or the clause. This does not destroy the value of consonant weight in the sound system; it is evident that a crowding or sparseness of consonants will make a great difference to the total rhythm, it will produce a greater or less heaviness or lightness; but that is a rhythmic effect quite distinct from any imperative influence on the metre. A trochee does not become a spondee, a dactyl does not become a cretic because its final syllable is followed by a consonant or even by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> of consonants. There is, then, no sense in dragging in the classical rule where its admission is quite contrary to the natural instinct and practice of the language.\n\nIf these considerations are accepted as valid, the way lies open for the construction of true quantitative metre; a sound and realistic theory of it becomes possible. Four rules or sets of rules can be formulated which will sum up the whole base of the theory:—\n\n(1) All stressed syllables are metrically long, as are also all long-vowel syllables even without stress.\n\nAll short-vowel syllables are metrically short, unless they<span class='page-number' id='s-339' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.339]</span> are lengthened by stress—or else by a sufficient weight of consonants or some other lengthening sound-element; but the mere fact of more than one consonant coming after a short vowel, whether within the word or after it, or both in combination, is not sufficient to confer length upon the syllable. Heaviness caused by a crowding of consonants affects the rhythm of a line or part of a line but does not alter its metrical values.\n\nEach word has its own metrical value which cannot be radically influenced or altered by the word that follows.\n\n(2) The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span> has many sounds which are doubtful or variable in quantity; these may be sometimes used as short and sometimes as long according to circumstance. Here the ear must be the judge.\n\n(3) Quantity within the syllable itself is not so rigidly fixed as in the ancient languages; often position or other circumstances may alter the metrical value of a syllable. A certain latitude has to be conceded in such cases, and there again the ear must be the judge.\n\n(4) Quantity metres cannot be as rigid and unalterable in English as in the old classical tongues; for the movement of the language is pliant and flexible and averse to rigidity and monotone. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span> has always a fundamental metrical basis, a fixed normality of the feet constituting a line; but it relieves the fixity by the use of modulations substituting, with sometimes a less, sometimes a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, other feet for the normal. This rule of variation, very occasionally admitted in the classical tongues but natural in English poetry, must be applied or at least permitted in quantitative metres also; otherwise, in poems of some length, their rhythms may become stereotyped in a too rigid sameness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span> the ear.\n\nNo other rules than these four need be laid down, for the rest must be left to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> choice and skill in technique.\n\nIn the basic structure of quantitative verse so arranged the three <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of English rhythm, accent, stress and intrinsic quantity are none of them excluded; all are united or even fused together. Accentual high pitch is taken up into stress; low pitch, not amounting to stress, as also slighter accentual inflexions<span class='page-number' id='s-340' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.340]</span> have their place in the rhythm and the intonation but not in the metre; they are not allowed to determine the metrical quantity of the syllable on which they fall. For, in fact, unless they amount to stress, these voice inflexions do not confer length of true quantity; the quantity conferred by them in accentual verse is conventional and need not be admitted where the accentual basis is abandoned and the convention is not needed. Stress itself is admitted as a quantitative element because it constitutes, by the weight of the voice which it lays on the syllable, a true metrical length, a strong sound-value. Intrinsic quantity, which is not recognised as a metrical constituent in the traditional verse system, recovers here its legitimate place. As a result quantitative metres can be constructed which, like accentual and stress metres but unlike the abortive constructions of the classicists, can flow naturally in a free movement, a movement native to the language; for they will combine in themselves without dis-figuration or forcing all the natural elements of the rhythm or sound-movement proper to the English tongue.\n\nIt may even be said that all English speech, colloquial, prose or verse, has this as its natural rhythm, preserves these normal sound-values. This universality will be at once evident if we take at will or even take at random any snatch of conversation or any prose passage caught from anywhere or everywhere and test by it this rule of quantity; it will be found that the rule is in all cases applicable.\n\n![Image 21](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-i.jpg)\n\nThese sentences set out with a dactylo-trochaic movement and change to less simple feet, ionic a minore, cretic, antibacchius, double trochee. Or if you hear an irate voice shouting\n\n![Image 22](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-j.jpg)\n\nand have sufficient leisure and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>equanimity</span> of mind to analyse the rhythm of this exhortation, you will find yourself in the presence of an excited double iamb followed by a vehement antispast,<span class='page-number' id='s-341' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.341]</span> and can then conscientiously determine the rhythm of your own answer. Or if one takes, as a resting-house between colloquial speech and literary prose, the first advertisement that meets the eye in any daily newspaper, the result will still infallibly illustrate our rule. For example,\n\n![Image 23](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-k.jpg)\n\nwhere amphibrach, paeons, iamb, tribrach, dactyl, cretic, double iamb are harmoniously blended together by an unconscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of quantitative rhythm. It can be at once and easily established, by multiplying instances, that the daily talk and writing of English-speaking peoples, though not by any means always poetry, is still, in spite of itself and by an unfelt compulsion, always rhythmic and always quantitative in its rhythm.\n\nIf we take similarly passages from literary prose, we shall find the same law of rhythm lifted to a higher level. Shakespeare and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bible</span> will give us the best and most concentrated examples of this rhythm in prose. Our first quotation, from the New Testament, can indeed be arranged, omitting the superfluous word \"even\" before \"Solomon\", as a very perfect and harmonious stanza of free quantitative verse.\n\n![Image 24](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-l.jpg)\n\nOr again, let us take the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> verses of the Sermon on the Mount,\n\n![Image 25](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-m.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-342' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.342]</span>\n\nOr from St. Paul,—\n\n![Image 26](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-n.jpg)\n\nIf we take Shakespeare's prose in a well-known passage, we shall find the same law of quantitative rhythm automatically arranging his word-movement—\n\n![Image 27](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-o.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-343' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.343]</span>\n\nThe measures of this prose rhythm find their units of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> in word-groups and not as in poetry in metrical lines; the syllabic combinations which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> feet do not follow here any fixed sequence. In colloquial speech the sequence is arranged by impulse of Nature or by the automatic play of the subconscious mind, in prose either by the instinctive or by the conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of an inner ear, by a secret and subtle hearing in our subliminal parts. There is not an arrangement of feet previously set by the mind and fixedly recurrent as in metre. But still the measures of speech are the same and in all these prose passages there is a dominant rhythm,—even sometimes a free recurrence or dominance of certain measures, not laid down or fixed, but easy and natural,—which gives an underlying unity to the whole passage. In the instance taken from Shakespeare a remarkable persistence of four-foot measures, with occasional shorter ones intervening, builds up a grave and massive rhythmic feeling and imparts even a poetic motion to the unified whole.\n\nIn free verse the difference of prose movement and poetic rhythm tends to disappear; poetry steps down to or towards the level of rhythmic, sometimes a very poorly rhythmic prose; but it is too often a rhythm which misses its aim at the ear and is not evident, still less convincing, though it may exist incommunicably somewhere in the mind of the writer. That indeed is the general modernistic tendency—to step back to the level of prose, sometimes to the colloquial level, both in language and in sound movement; the tendency, the aim even, is to throw away the intensities of poetic rhythm and poetic language and approximate to a prose intonation and to a prose diction; one intensity only is kept in view and that too not always, the intensity of the thought substance. It is the thought substance that is expected to determine its own sound harmonies—as in prose: the thought must not subject itself to a preconceived or set rhythm, it must be free from the metrical strait-waistcoat; or else the metrical mould must be sufficiently irregular, capricious, easily modifiable to give a new freedom and ease of movement to the thought substance.\n\nOur immediate concern, however, is with quantitative metre<span class='page-number' id='s-344' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.344]</span> constructed on this principle of quantity,—though free verse also on that basis has to be taken into consideration as a subordinate possibility. After all, the swing against metre has not justified itself; it goes contrary to a very profound law of speech, contradicts a very strong need of the ear, and the metreless verse it prefers disappoints, by the frequent flatness and inequality which seems natural to it at its ordinary level, the listening <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> proceeds on a basis of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> and sameness with a superstructure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span>, and there is the highest creation where is the intensest power of basic unity and sameness and on that supporting basis the intensest power of appropriate and governed diversity. In poetic speech metre gives us this intensest power of basic unity and sameness—rhythmic variation gives us this intensest power of expressive diversity. Metre was in the thought of the Vedic poets the reproduction in speech of great creative world-rhythms; it is not a mere formal construction, though it may be made by the mind into even such a lifeless form: but even that lifeless form or convention, when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> breathe the force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> into it, becomes again what it was meant to be, it becomes itself and serves its own true and great purpose. There is an intonation of poetry which is different from the flatter and looser intonation of prose, and with it a heightened or gathered intensity of language, a deepened vibrating intensity of rhythm, an intense inspiration in the thought substance. One leaps up with this rhythmic spring or flies upon these wings of rhythmic exaltation to a higher scale of consciousness which expresses things common with an uncommon power both of vision and of utterance and things uncommon with their own native and revealing accent; it expresses them, as no mere prose speech can do, with a certain kind of deep appealing intimacy of truth which poetic rhythm alone gives to expressive form and power of language: the greater this element, the greater is the poetry. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of this power can be there without metre, but metre is its spontaneous form, raises it to its acme. The tradition of metre is not a vain and foolish convention followed by the great poets of the past in a primitive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> unconscious of their<span class='page-number' id='s-345' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.345]</span> own bondage; it is in spite of its appearance of human convention a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of Nature</span>, an innermost mind-nature, a highest speech-nature.\n\nBut it does not immediately follow that the metrical application to poetry of the normal rhythm of the language, discoverable even in its colloquial speech and prose, is imperatively called for or that the construction of quantitative metres in that mould will be a needed or a right procedure. It might be reasoned, on the contrary, that precisely because this is a normal movement for colloquial speech and prose, it must be ill-fitted for poetry; poetic speech is supernormal, above the ordinary level, and its principle of rhythm should be other than that of common language. Moreover, it may be said, the admission of intrinsic rhythmic quantities to a share in determining the metrical basis would in practice only give us an accentual or stress metre with a slight difference, and the difference would be for the worse. For the function which quantity now serves in accentual verse as a powerful free element in the variation of the rhythm, would be sacrificed; quantitative verse would be bound to a rigid beat which would impose on it the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of a monotonous drone or would fix it in a shackled stiffness like the drumming of the early \"decasyllabon\" or that treadmill movement which has been charged, as an incurable defect, against the English hexameter.\n\nBut let us note, first, that there can be no idea of replacing altogether the normal accentual mould of English verse by a quantitative structure; the object can only be to introduce new rhythms which would extend and vary the established achievement of English poetry, to create new moulds, to add a rich and possibly a very spacious modern wing to an old edifice. Even if the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> are only an improvement on stress metre, a rhythm starting from the same swing of the language, that is no objection; it may still be worth doing if it brings in new tunes, other cadences, fresh subtleties of wordmusic. As for the objection of a tied-up monotony caused by the disappearance of the free placing and variation of the pure quantitative elements in metrical rhythm, that need not be the<span class='page-number' id='s-346' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.346]</span> consequence: there are other means of variation which are sufficient to dispel that peril. A free use of modulation, an avoidance of metrical rigidity by other devices natural to the flexibility of the English tongue, a skilful employment of overlapping (*enjambement*), of caesura, of word-grouping are presupposed in any reasonable quantitative system. Even where a very regular movement is necessitated or desirable, the resources of the play of sound, a subtle play of vowellation and of consonant harmonies, rhythmic undertones and overtones ought to cure the alleged deficiency. It is not the nature of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> but the unskilful hand that creates the flaw; for each kind of material has its own limitations and its own possibilities, and the hand of the craftsman is needed to restrict or overcome the limitations, even to take advantage of the natural bounds and bring out the full force of the latent creativeness concealed in the obstructing matter.\n\nThe application of the quantitative principle and the discovery of the forms that are possible are the task of the creator, not of the theoretical critic. It is, first and foremost, English quantitative forms that we have to create; the reproduction or new-creation of classical metres in English speech is only a side issue. Here the possibilities are endless, but they fall into two or three categories. First, there can be fixed quantitative metres repeated from line to line without variation except for such modulations as are, in the form chosen, possible or desirable. Secondly, stanza forms can be found, either analogous to those used in accentual verse or else analogous to the Greek arrangement in strophe and antistrophe. Thirdly, one can use a freer quantitative verse in which each line has its own appropriate movement, the feet <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> variable, but with a predominant single rhythm unifying the whole. Lastly, there can be entirely free quantitative verse, true verse with a poetic rhythm, but not bound by any law of metre. The stanza form is the most suitable to quantitative verse, for here there can be much variety and the danger of rigidity or monotony is non-existent. The use of set stanza metres simple or composite is less obligatory than it was in classical verse; even, each poem can discover<span class='page-number' id='s-347' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.347]</span> its own metrical stanza form most in consonance with its own thought and feeling. The fixed metre unchanging from line to line needs greater skill; modulation is here of great importance. A semi-free quantitative verse also gives considerable scope; it can be planned in a form resembling that of the Greek chorus but without the fixed balance of strophe and antistrophe, or a still looser use can be made of it escaping towards the freedom of modernistic verse. There are in this collection of poems examples of the first two methods, the fixed metre and the set stanza or the strophe and antistrophe arrangement;[^5] a few more, illustrative of these and other forms, are added at the end of this appendix. There is one illustration of semi-free and one of free quantitative verse.\n\n[^5]: *\"On Quantitative Metre\" first appeared as an appendix to Sri Aurobindo's* Collected Poems and Plays (*1942*). *The examples mentioned as occurring \"in this collection of poems\" are now published in* Collected Poems. *They include \"Ahana\" and some of the poems in \"Six Poems\" and \"Poems [1941]\".—Ed.*\n\nAn unconsciously quantitative free verse may be said to exist already in the writings of Whitman and contemporary modernist poets. In modern free verse the underlying impulse is to get away from the fixed limitations of accentual metre, its set forms and its traditional \"poetic\" language, and to create forms and a diction more kin to the natural rhythm and turns of language which we find in common speech and in prose. To throw away the bonds of metre altogether, to approximate not only in the language but in the rhythmic movement to normal speech and to prose tone and prose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> was the method first preferred; a great deal of free verse is nothing but prose cut up into lines to make it look like verse. But in the more skilful treatment by the greater writers there is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> to arrive at a certain power of rhythm and a sufficient unity of movement. Free verse cannot justify itself unless it makes a thing of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of every line and achieves at the same time an underlying rhythmic oneness; this is imperative when the power for form and the uplifting intensity of metrical verse is absent, if this kind of writing is not to be, as it too often is, a failure. In the best poetry of the kind the attempt to achieve this end arrives precisely at a form of free<span class='page-number' id='s-348' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.348]</span> quantitative verse based on the natural rhythm of the language liberated from all metrical convention of regularity, and there is sometimes an approximation to its highest possibilities. But the approximation is not so near as it might have been in the work of one who had the theory before him; for it was not the conscious mind, but the creative ear that was active and compelled this result, helped no doubt by the will to outdo the beauty of accentual metrical rhythm in a freer poetry.\n\nIn Whitman the attempt at perfection of rhythm is often present and, when he does his best as a rhythmist, it rises to a high-strung acuteness which gives a great beauty of movement to his finest lines; but what he arrives at is a true quantitative free verse.\n\n![Image 28](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-p.jpg)\n\nThat is comparatively rare in its high beauty; but everywhere the rhythmic trend is the same wherever we look at it,—as in the rhymed freedom of this opening,—\n\n![Image 29](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-q.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-349' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.349]</span>\n\nEven when he loosens into a laxity nearer to prose, the compact quantitative movement, though much less high-strung, is still there,—\n\n![Image 30](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-r.jpg)\n\nIt is only when he lies back or lolls indolently content with spreading himself out in a democratic averageness of rhythm that the intensity of poetic movement fades out; but the free quantitative movement is there even then, though near now to the manner and quality of prose.\n\nThe later practicians of free verse have not often the heightened rhythmic movement of Whitman at his best, but still they are striving towards the same kind of thing, and their work apparently and deliberately amorphous receives something like a shape, a balance, a reasoned meaning when scanned as quantitative free verse. We find this in passages of *The Waste Land* and *The Hollow Men*, e.g.,\n\n![Image 31](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-s.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-350' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.350]</span>\n\nOr let us take a passage from Stephen Spender,—\n\n![Image 32](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-a-theory-of-true-quantity-t.jpg)\n\nThere is a rhythm there, but it is not sufficiently gathered up or vivid and it is much more subdued than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eliot</span>'s towards the atony and flatness of ordinary prose rhythm. The last lines of the quotation from *The Hollow Men* could be used to describe with a painful accuracy most of this ametric poetry. Some kind of poetic shape is there but no realised and convincing form; shade there is plenty, but colour—except perhaps blacks,<span class='page-number' id='s-351' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.351]</span> browns, greys and silver-greys—is mostly absent; force is there but paralysed or only half-carrying out its intention, gestures with much <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and straining, but no successful motion. In less excellent passages of the free verse writers this atony comes out very evidently; all intensity of poetic rhythm disappears and we plod through arid waste-lands. There is an insistence on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formlessness</span> as the basis and each writer tries to shape his own rhythm out of this arhythmic amorphousness, sometimes with a half success, but not always or very often. This is clearly the reason of the failure of free verse and the reason too of several besetting general deficiencies of modernist verse; for even where there is form or metre, it seems ashamed of itself and tries to look as if there were none. It is the reason also of the discouraging inequality of modernist poetry, its failure to achieve any supreme beauty or greatness, any outstanding work which could compare with the masterpieces of other epochs. Inspiration is the source of poetic intensity and, while inspiration comes when it will and not at command, yet it is more tempted to come and can be more sustained when there is a conscious and constant form to receive it,—not necessarily metre in the received sense,—and although the highest breath of inspiration cannot, even so, be continuous, for the human mind is too frail to sustain the supernormal luminous inrush, yet the form sustains quality, keeps it at a higher level than can any licence of caprice or freedom of shapelessness. When the form is not there the inspiration, the intensity that gives perfect poetic expression to idea, feeling or vision, keeps more at a distance and has to be dragged in with an effort; even if it comes in lines, phrases, passages, afterwards its impulse ceases or flags and toils and through long weary pages one feels its persistent absence or unwilling half-presence and the mass of the work remains unsatisfying. What is done may be strong or interesting in substance, but it lacks the immortal shape. Mind is there, a fertile and forceful, sometimes too acute and forceful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, but not life, not a firm lasting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. It is possible that one day the impulse which created free verse may be justified; but, if so, it can only be done when a free form is achieved, a free rhythmic unity. For that end the best<span class='page-number' id='s-352' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.352]</span> work of Whitman would seem to point to a free but finely built quantitative rhythm as the most promising base.

Among these metres the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hexameter</span> stands as the central knot of the problem; if that is loosened, the rest follows. But first let us return on past attempts and their failure and find by that study a basis of comparison between the true and the false hexameter. There are here two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> to be considered, the metrical form and the characteristic rhythm; both <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Clough</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Longfellow</span> have failed for the most part to get into their form the true metrical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and missed too by that failure to get the true inner rhythm, the something more that is the soul of the hexameter. Of the two, Longfellow achieved the smoother half-success—or rather the more plausible failure. He realised that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metre</span> must be predominantly dactylic and maintained a smooth dactylic flow, broken only by the false, because mechanical, use of trochees to vary the continuous dactylic beat. Other modulations could not be used with effect because the accentual system only admits in the hexameter the dactyl, the spondee and the trochee. For <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> three-syllabled feet are in the accentual hexameter reduced to dactyls. The tribrach gets right of entry by imposing an accentual low pitch on its inherently unaccented and unstressed first syllable, e.g.,\n\n![Image 33](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-problem-of-the-hexameter-a.jpg)\n\nThe anapaest is cooked up into a pseudo-dactyl by a similar device of false accentuation and by the belittling of its long vowel, the antibacchius and cretic by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span> or half-suppression of the value of the unstressed long syllable, the second long bar that gives them their musical value; the molossus is shorn<span class='page-number' id='s-353' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.353]</span> of its strength by a similar treatment of all its syllables except the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> long sound. All are disabled from coming out in relief on the dactylic background and so cannot do their work as modulating variants; for that they should enter in their own right as themselves and not as false dactyls and with their full metrical value. Even among the three available feet the trochee gives poor service; for it rarely fits in,—its effect, when it is used mechanically as a device and with no meaningful appropriateness or rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, disturbs the dactylic flow without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> any relief to the dactylic monotone. Dactyl and spondee by themselves, pure and unmodulated, or the dactyl by itself cannot, unhelped and unrelieved, bear successfully the burden of a long poem in accentual metre.\n\nLongfellow treats us to a non-stop flow of even hexameters with few overlappings and insufficient use of pauses; such overlappings as there are are hardly noticeable, so mechanical is their intervention, so entirely uncalled by rhythmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> and unburdened with meaning; the pauses are sometimes well-done but the whole tone of the rhythm is so mechanical that even then they lose their effect and seem almost artificial. The result on the rhythmic whole is disastrous; a smooth even sing-song is the constant note, a movement without nobility or beauty or power or swiftness. Sometimes we come across passages that are adequate and achieve a quiet and subdued beauty—\n\n>Filled was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> with a dreamy and magical light, and the landscape\nLay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.\nPeace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the ocean\nWas for a moment consoled. All sounds were in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> blended.\n\nIn such passages, the metre, though accentual, satisfies the quantitative demand and so escapes from its deficiencies, but the rhythm is too flatly smooth and still indistinctive; it fails to support and achieve fully by the something more behind the metrical movement the beauty that the words intended. Some charm of delicacy is achieved, but it lacks power, height and depth; here certainly is not the tread of the great Olympian measure. Ordinarily, the note sinks lower and even descends to<span class='page-number' id='s-354' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.354]</span> a very low pitch; we hear, not the roll of the hexameter, but some six-foot dactylic rhythm resembling a sort of measured prose recitative—\n\n>Then he arose from his bed and heard what the people were saying,\nJoined in the talk at the door with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,\nJoined in the morning prayer and in the reading of Scripture.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Note the detestable combination of two flat trochees with a falsified tribrach in the middle of this line. These false movements abound in the accentual hexameter.\n\nAnd yet even the accentual (or perhaps <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> should say the stress) hexameter is capable of better things. Clough, aiming at this stronger efficiency, tries to escape from the treadmill motion, the sing-song, the monotone; but he does not altogether get away from it and arrives only at a familiar vigour or a capable but undistinguished movement, or falls into a trotting and stumbling rhythm which is sometimes hardly even a rhythm. In attempting to shun the monotony of the unuplifted dactylic beat, he often totally overlays or half overlays the metrical basis of the hexameter rhythm which must be always a sustained dactylic movement. He perpetrates frequently lines that are wholly trochaic and have only this in common with the hexameter that they walk on six feet; a host of other lines are, if not wholly, yet predominantly trochaic. This, which can sometimes be done in a true hexameter rhythm with a special intonation and a special purpose, is fatal if constantly used as an ordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of a machine. Very often the trochees break a line that would otherwise have been adequate; sometimes there is what seems to be a cross between hexameter and pentameter; often he indulges in an anapaestic line, sometimes three at a time, disguised as hexameters by turning an initial pyrrhic into a false trochee. The result tends to be tedious, trivial and disappointing; let us take a sample—\n\n>So they bathed, they read, they roamed in glen and forest\nFar amid blackest pines to the waterfalls they shadow,\nFar up the long long glens to the loch and the loch behind it\nDeep under huge red cliffs, a secret, and oft by the starlight<span class='page-number' id='s-355' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.355]</span>\n\n![Image 34](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-problem-of-the-hexameter-b.jpg)\n\n>So they bathed and read and roamed in heathery Highland.[^2]\n\n[^2]: Note that this, the sole truly dactylic line, with quantitative modulations, is in spite of its deliberate prosaism less unsatisfactory in sound than the rest of the passage.\n\nThis indistinctive paddling has even less of the sound and rhythm of the true hexameter than Longfellow's verses which are at least hexametric in form and surface appearance.\n\nBut still there are passages, not numerous enough, in which he loses his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of the pure dactylic movement and does not replace it or break it with the disturbing intrusion of unmanaged or unassimilated trochees; he arrives then at \"accentual\" lines,—if they must be so called, but they are really stress lines,—with a firm beat that makes the metrical structure adequate; or he achieves a movement in which the trochees come in with a distinct rhythmic meaning and significant effect or, at the least, make themselves at home in the dactylic rhythm, or he brings in other modulations in a way proper to the quantitative hexameter.\n\n>Found amid granite dust on the frosty scalp of the Cairngorm....\nEying one moment the beauty, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, ere he flung himself in it,\nDrinking in, deep in his soul, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> hue and the clearness....\nOften I find myself saying and know not myself as I say it,\nPerish the poor and the weary! what can they better than perish,\nPerish in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for her who is worth the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>empires</span>?...\nDig in thy deep dark prison, O miner! and finding be thankful,\n\n![Image 35](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-problem-of-the-hexameter-c.jpg)\n\n>Far away glitters the gem on the peerless neck of a princess....\nInto a granite bason the amber torrent descended.\n\nThese lines are metrically and rhythmically adequate; the treatment of the metre is unexceptionable: there is a true form, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> basis and beginning of a genuine hexameter movement; and yet something is lacking, something which ought to be there<span class='page-number' id='s-356' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.356]</span> and is not, and its absence prevents them from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> quite effective. It is the rhythm that in spite of its soundness is not altogether alive, does not keep sufficiently alert, has not found the true movement that would give it the full power and speed of the true hexameter. A second fault is that while <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> lines are good and may sound even excellent when read by themselves or even two or three at a time, there is no rhythmic harmony of the long passage or paragraph; one has, in the mass, the sense of listening to the same indifferent and undistinguished movement repeated without sufficient meaningful variation and without any harmonious total significance. Above all the large hexameter rhythm, such as we have it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> or Latin, has not been found, nor anything that would equal it as a native English harmony fitted for great poetic speech, for great thoughts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, for great action and movement. There is a tameness of sound, a flatness of level, or, even when beauty or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> is there, it is a tenuous beauty, a strength that is content to be low-toned and moderate.\n\nOne reason of this deficiency must be that in all this work the hexameter is compelled to express subjects whose triviality brings it down far below its natural pitch of greatness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> or beauty. A pathetically sentimental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> story, a rather dullhued tale of courtship among New <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> Puritans, the trifling doings and amours and chaff and chat of holiday-making undergraduates, these are not subjects in which either language or rhythm can rise to any great heights or reach out into revealing largenesses; they are obliged to key themselves to commonness and flatness; the language is as often as not confidentially familiar or prosaic, a manner good enough for some other kinds of verse but not entitled to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in the power of the great classical metre. There can be in such an atmosphere no room and no courage to dare to rise into any uplifting grandeur or break out into any extreme of beauty. Both Clough and Longfellow tell their stories well and it is more for the interest of the contents than for the beauty of the poetry that we read them. But the hexameter was made for nobler purposes; it has been the medium of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> or pastoral or it tuned itself to a<span class='page-number' id='s-357' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.357]</span> powerful or forcefully pointed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span>; power and beauty are its native <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and, even when it turns to satire or to familiar speech, it keeps always one or other or both of these characteristics. There is no sound reason why it should be otherwise in English, why this great metre should be condemned to an inferior level and inferior purpose; if that is done, it fails its user and dissatisfies the reader.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, Clough does once or twice rise above these limitations. Here, following immediately three lines that have been already quoted as good in their limits, come three others that suddenly realise the true hexameter rhythm; there is the life and energy natural to that rhythm, there is the characteristic swiftness, rush, force, which is one of its notes, there is an exact clothing of the thought, feeling or action in its own native movement—\n\n>What! for a mite, or a mote, an impalpable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>odour</span> of honour\nArmies shall bleed, cities burn, and the soldier red from the storming\nCarry hot rancour and lust into chambers of mothers and daughters!\n\nAt another place he rises still higher and suddenly discovers, though only once in a way and apparently without being conscious of his find, the rhythm of the true quantitative hexameter—\n\n![Image 36](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-problem-of-the-hexameter-d.jpg)\n\nwhere the opening antibacchius and spondee followed by bounding and undulating dactyls give a sound-value recognisable as akin to the ancient movement. It would be an epic line if it were not in the mock-heroic style; but, even so, if we met it apart from its context, it would remind us at once of the Homeric rhythms—\n\n>Bē de kat' Oulumpoio karēnōn chōömenos kēr....<span class='page-number' id='s-358' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.358]</span>\n\nIf all the poem had been written in that manner or in accordant rhythms, the problem of the English hexameter would have been solved; there would have been no failure or half failure.[^3]\n\n[^3]: <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kingsley</span>'s \"Andromeda\" deserves a mention, for it is the most readable of English hexameter poems; the verse is well-constructed, much better than Clough's; it has not the sing-song tameness of Longfellow, there is rhythm, there is resonance. But though the frame is correct and very presentable, there is nothing or little inside it. Kingsley has the trick of romantic language, romantic imagination and thinking, but he is not an original poet; the poetic value of his work is far inferior to Clough's or Longfellow's, it is not sound and good stuff but romantic tinsel.\n\nWe begin to glimpse the conditions of success and may now summarily state them. The hexameter is a dactylic metre and it must remain unequivocally and patently dactylic; there can be no escape from its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> by diminishing the dactylic beat: rather its full quantitative force has to be brought out,—the more that is done, the more the true rhythm will appear. But this need not bring in any sing-song, treadmill walk or monotone. In Longfellow, in Clough at their ordinary level, it is the low even tone without relief, the repetition of a semi-trochaic jog-trot or a smooth unvarying canter, the beat of tame dactyls, that gives this impression. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Harvey</span> or similar writers it is the constrained artificial treatment of the metre that enforces a treadmill labour. But this is not the true hexameter movement; the true movement is a swift stream or a large flow, an undulating run, the impetuous bounding of a torrent, an ocean surge or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> gallop of the horses of the sungod. There must be one underlying sameness as in all metre, but there can and should be at the same time a considerable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> on the surface. That can be secured by several means, each of which gives plenty of room for rhythmic subtlety and for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> turns of sound significance. There is the pause in various places of the line, near the beginning, at the middle or just after it or close to the end; all admit of a considerable variety in the exact placing, modulation, combination of the pause or pauses. There is also the line caesura and the foot caesura. The hexameter line in English may be cut into two or else three equal dactylic parts, or it may be cut anywhere in the middle of a foot and this admits of a number of very effective<span class='page-number' id='s-359' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.359]</span> variations which obviate monotony altogether. For example—\n\n>    In the dawn-ray lofty and voiceless\nIda climbed with her god-haunted peaks | into diamond lustres,\nIda first of the hills | with the ranges silent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> her\nWatching the dawn in their giant companies, | as since the ages\nFirst began | they had watched her, | upbearing Time on their summits....\n\n>\"Hero Aeneas, swift be thy stride to the Ilian hill-top.\nDardanid, haste! for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> are at work; they have risen with the morning,\nEach from his starry couch, and they labour.

Action and impulse,\nYearning and thought are their engines, our will is their shadow and helper.\"\n\nThere are many other devices for variation: there is overlapping,—but it must be skilfully managed so as to coincide with perceptible movements of the thought, not used merely as a customary technical device; there is the constant attention to the right vowellation and consonant harmonies which can give an individual character to each line and are also intimately connected with the rhythmic rendering of significance. Even though the free rhythmic placing of intrinsic long syllables is taken away, since they are now bound down to a metrical use, still much can be done with the distribution of stressed long vowels and stressed short vowels among the six beats; for the predominance of either in a line or passage or their more or less equal distribution in various ways creates different psychologies of sound and dictates large or wide or narrow or subtle motions of both rhythm and feeling. In this opening of a poem—<span class='page-number' id='s-360' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.360]</span>\n\n>Dawn in her journey eternal compelling the labour of mortals,\nDawn the beginner of things with the night for their rest or their ending,\nPallid and bright-lipped arrived from the mists and the chill of the Euxine—\n\nin the first line the stressed long vowels predominate, in the second the stressed short vowels, in the third there is an equal distribution; in each case there is a suiting of the choices of sound to a different shade of movement-sense. In another passage—\n\n>        Doffing his mantle\nStarted to run at the bidding a swift-footed youth of the Trojans\nFirst in the race and the battle, Thrasymachus son of Aretes,\n\nwe can see that the predominance of short stresses amounting to an almost unbroken succession of natural short-vowel syllables creates a long running swiftness of the rhythm which fits in exactly with the action. All these minutiae are part of the technique and the possibilities of the hexameter and, if they are neglected or ineffectively used, the fault does not lie with the metre. The natural resources of the true quantitative hexameter are so great that even a long series of end-stopped lines would not necessarily create a monotone.\n\nFinally, there is the resource of modulation, and in the quantitative hexameter this can be used with great effect, either sparingly or in abundance, best sparing perhaps in epic or high narrative, abundant in poems of complex thinking and emotion. There is only one possible modulation in place of the spondee and that is the trochee. In the quantitative hexameter the trochee, unless unskilfully used, does not break or hurt the flow; it modifies the total rhythm so as to give it an expressive turn and it can easily make itself a part of the general dactylic streaming. For example—\n\n>High over all that a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> had built and its love and its laughter,\nLighting the last time highway and homestead, market and temple,\n\n![Image 37](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/26-the-problem-of-the-hexameter-e.jpg)<span class='page-number' id='s-361' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.361]</span>\n\nHere the two trochees together—a combination almost always awkward or crippling in the accentual hexameter—and the trochee followed by a cretic fit easily into the movement and create by their unusual and appropriate turn of sound a modulation of the rhythmic feeling. If the third line were written\n\n>Looking on men who must die and on women predestined to sorrow,\n\nthe common indistinguishable metrical run would not at all serve the intended meaning,—it would be a statement and would inform the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> but, robbed of the special turn of sound, it would not move. For the dactyl there is a great number of possible modulations; the antibacchius can be used freely, the lighter cretic less freely but still frequently, the first paeon often but not too often; even the lighter molossus can come in to our aid; the tribrach or the anapaest can introduce the first foot of a line or step in after a pause in the middle, but elsewhere they can seldom intervene or only if it is done very carefully. Even the choriamb or the double trochee can be employed in place of the paeon, if the second long syllable of the foot is unstressed and therefore not burdensome. Heavy trisyllables can be allowed only now and then, if the movement demands them. But in fact all modulations must be employed only when there is the rhythmic necessity or for rhythmic significance; if they are used mechanically without reason or at random, it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the harmony and often destroys it. Rhythmic necessity intervenes when the special movement needed by the thought, feeling or action must so be brought about, by modulation of the fixed rhythm or a departure from it;[^4] rhythmic significance occurs when the deeper unexpressed soul sense behind the words is brought out, not by word but by sound, to the surface.\n\n[^4]: Thus even an almost wholly trochaic or a wholly spondaic line can be admitted when it is demanded by the action, e.g.,\n\n  He from the carven couch upreared his giant stature\n\n  or,\n\n  Fate-weighed up Troy's slope strode musing strong Aeneas.\n\nThe efficacy of this technique depends on the power of the<span class='page-number' id='s-362' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.362]</span> writer to discover and sustain the true movement of the hexameter, its spirit and character, such as we find it in the ancient epics, pastorals, epistles, satires in which it was used with a supreme greatness or a consummate mastery. That movement can be of many kinds; it admits a considerable variation of pace, sometimes swift, sometimes slow, short in its rapidity or long-drawn-out with many rhythmic turns, and there are several possibilities in each kind. Only a considerable poetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> could bring out the full power and subtleties of its rhythms; but it is essential for even a tolerable success to find and keep up a true length and pitch in the delivery of the lines; the dactylic flow is especially exacting in this respect on the care of the rhythmist. An undulant run is the easiest to maintain, the most simple and natural pace, but it has to be varied by other movements, a long or a brief bounding swiftness, the light rapid run or a slower deliberate running; a large even stream is a second possibility as a basic rhythm, but this needs a Virgilian genius or talent; the surge is the greatest of all, but only the born epic poet could sustain it for a long time,—it suits indeed only the epic or highpitched narrative, but it can come in from time to time as an occasional high rise from a lower level of rhythmic plenitude. Finally, rhyme can be used for poems of reflective thought or lyrical feeling; but it must not be made the excuse for a melodic monotone. That kind of melodic fixity is permissible in very short dactylic pieces, but the hexameter does not move at ease in a short range: it has fluted in the pastoral grove and walked on the Appian way, but it loves better the free sky and the winds of the ocean; it finds its natural self in the wide plain, on high mountains or in the surge and roll of a long venturous voyage.\n\nIf the difficulty of the hexameter can be successfully overcome, no insuperable impossibility need be met in the naturalisation of other classical metres, for the harmonic principle will be the same. All that is necessary is that artificial quantity and the atmosphere of a pastime or an experiment must be abandoned; there must not be the sense of an importation or a construction, the metre must read as if it were a born English rhythm, not a naturalised alien. It would be a mistake to cling to rigid scholarly<span class='page-number' id='s-363' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.363]</span> correctness in the process; these metres must submit to the natural law of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English poetry</span>, to movements and liberties which the classical rhythms do not admit, to modulation, to slight facilitating changes of form, to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of different models of itself, as there are different models of the sonnet. The Alcaic is the most attractive and manageable of the ancient lyrical metres, but in English even the Alcaic cannot easily be the same in all respects as the original verse form of its creator. The original model can indeed be reproduced; but modulations have to be brought in to help the difficulties experienced by English speech in taking a foreign metre into itself; trochees have very usually to be substituted for the not easily found spondee, an occasional anapaest, a paeon lengthening out the orthodox dactyl should not be excluded; the omission of the first syllable in the opening line of the stanza can be admitted as an occasional licence. Otherwise the full harmonic possibilities of this rhythmic measure in its new tongue cannot be richly exploited. The Horatian form in which the two opening lines very commonly end in a cretic doing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> for the theoretic dactyl, is more manageable in English, in which a constant dactylic close to the line is not easily handled: this change gives a less melodious, a graver and more sculptural turn to the outlines of the stanza. Finally, to this Horatian form it is possible to give a greater amplitude by admitting a feminine ending in these two lines, the cretic turning into a double trochee. That does not break or destroy the spirit and character of the Alcaic verse; it gives it more largeness and resonance.\n\nOther lyrical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> may be less amenable to change; there is sometimes too close an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and the spirit. It is so with the Sapphic, an alluring metre but, as experimenters have found, difficult to change and anglicise: here only slight modulations are admissible, the trochee for the spondee, the antibacchius or light cretic for the dactyl. Still others would need the minute and scrupulous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goldsmith</span> or the force of a giant to make anything of them; yet they are worth trying, for one never knows whether the difficulty may not be the way to a triumph or a *trouvaille*.
