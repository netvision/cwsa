We are in an age, full of the throes of travail, when all forms of thought and activity that have in themselves any strong power of utility or any secret virtue of persistence are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> subjected to a supreme test and given their opportunity of rebirth. The world today presents the aspect of a huge cauldron of Medea in which all things are being cast, shredded into pieces, experimented on, combined and recombined either to perish and provide the scattered material of new forms or to emerge rejuvenated and changed for a fresh term of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. Indian Yoga, in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> a special <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> or formulation of certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>great powers</span> of Nature, itself specialised, divided and variously formulated, is potentially <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of these dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> of immemorial ages, preserved by its vitality and truth into our modern times, it is now emerging from the secret schools and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> retreats in which it had taken refuge and is seeking its place in the future sum of living human powers and utilities. But it has first to rediscover itself, bring to the surface<span class='page-number' id='s-5' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.5]</span> the profoundest reason of its being in that general truth and that unceasing aim of Nature which it represents, and find by virtue of this new self-knowledge and self-appreciation its own recovered and larger synthesis. Reorganising itself, it will enter more easily and powerfully into the reorganised life of the race which its processes claim to lead within into the most secret penetralia and upward to the highest altitudes of existence and personality.\n\nIn the right view both of life and of Yoga all life is either consciously or subconsciously a Yoga. For we mean by this term a methodised effort towards self-perfection by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the secret potentialities latent in the being and—highest condition of victory in that effort—a union of the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> with the universal and transcendent Existence we see partially expressed in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cosmos</span>. But all life, when we look behind its appearances, is a vast Yoga of Nature who attempts in the conscious and the subconscious to realise her perfection in an ever-increasing expression of her yet unrealised potentialities and to unite herself with her own divine reality. In man, her thinker, she for the first time upon this Earth devises self-conscious means and willed arrangements of activity by which this great purpose may be more swiftly and puissantly attained. Yoga, as Swami Vivekananda has said, may be regarded as a means of compressing one's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> into a single life or a few years or even a few months of bodily existence. A given system of Yoga, then, can be no more than a selection or a compression, into narrower but more energetic forms of intensity, of the general methods which are already being used loosely, largely, in a leisurely movement, with a profuser apparent waste of material and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> but with a more complete combination by the great Mother in her vast upward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span>. It is this view of Yoga that can alone form the basis for a sound and rational synthesis of Yogic methods. For then Yoga ceases to appear something <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> and abnormal which has no relation to the ordinary processes of the World-Energy or the purpose she keeps in view in her two great movements of subjective and objective self-fulfilment; it reveals itself rather as an intense and exceptional use of powers that she has already manifested or is progressively<span class='page-number' id='s-6' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.6]</span> organising in her less exalted but more general operations.\n\nYogic methods have something of the same relation to the customary psychological workings of man as has the scientific handling of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>electricity</span> or of steam to their normal operations in Nature. And they, too, like the operations of Science, are formed upon a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> developed and confirmed by regular experiment, practical analysis and constant result. All Rajayoga, for instance, depends on this perception and experience that our inner elements, combinations, functions, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, can be separated or dissolved, can be new-combined and set to novel and formerly impossible workings or can be transformed and resolved into a new general synthesis by fixed internal processes. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hathayoga</span> similarly depends on this perception and experience that the vital forces and functions to which our life is normally subjected and whose ordinary operations seem set and indispensable, can be mastered and the operations changed or suspended with results that would otherwise be impossible and that seem miraculous to those who have not seized the rationale of their process. And if in some other of its forms this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of Yoga is less apparent, because they are more intuitive and less mechanical, nearer, like the Yoga of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span>, to a supernal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> or, like the Yoga of Knowledge, to a supernal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and being, yet they too start from the use of some principal faculty in us by ways and for ends not contemplated in its everyday spontaneous workings. All methods grouped under the common name of Yoga are special psychological processes founded on a fixed truth of Nature and developing, out of normal functions, powers and results which were always latent but which her ordinary movements do not easily or do not often manifest.\n\nBut as in physical knowledge the multiplication of scientific processes has its disadvantages, as that tends, for instance, to develop a victorious artificiality which overwhelms our natural human life under a load of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> and to purchase certain forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and mastery at the price of an increased servitude, so the preoccupation with Yogic processes and their exceptional results may have its disadvantages and losses. The<span class='page-number' id='s-7' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.7]</span> Yogin tends to draw away from the common existence and lose his hold upon it; he tends to purchase wealth of spirit by an impoverishment of his human activities, the inner freedom by an outer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>. If he gains <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, he loses life, or if he turns his efforts outward to conquer life, he is in danger of losing God. Therefore we see in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> that a sharp incompatibility has been created between life in the world and spiritual growth and perfection, and although the tradition and ideal of a victorious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> between the inner attraction and the outer demand remains, it is little or else very imperfectly exemplified. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, when a man turns his vision and energy inward and enters on the path of Yoga, he is popularly supposed to be lost inevitably to the great stream of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective existence</span> and the secular effort of humanity. So strongly has the idea prevailed, so much has it been emphasised by prevalent philosophies and religions that to escape from life is now commonly considered as not only the necessary condition, but the general object of Yoga. No synthesis of Yoga can be satisfying which does not, in its aim, reunite God and Nature in a liberated and perfected human life or, in its method, not only permit but favour the harmony of our inner and outer activities and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> in the divine consummation of both. For man is precisely that term and symbol of a higher Existence descended into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span> in which it is possible for the lower to transfigure itself and put on the nature of the higher and the higher to reveal itself in the forms of the lower. To avoid the life which is given him for the realisation of that possibility, can never be either the indispensable condition or the whole and ultimate object of his supreme endeavour or of his most powerful means of self-fulfilment. It can only be a temporary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> under certain conditions or a specialised extreme effort imposed on the individual so as to prepare a greater general possibility for the race. The true and full object and utility of Yoga can only be accomplished when the conscious Yoga in man becomes, like the subconscious Yoga in Nature, outwardly conterminous with life itself and we can once more, looking out both on the path and the achievement, say in a more perfect and luminous sense: \"All life is Yoga.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-8' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.8]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/life-and-yoga","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Conditions of the Synthesis"}],"nxtt":"The Three Steps of Nature","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-three-steps-of-nature","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-three-steps-of-nature"],"t":"The Three Steps of Nature","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We recognise then, in the past developments of Yoga, a specialising and separative tendency which, like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> things in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, had its justifying and even imperative utility and we seek a synthesis of the specialised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> and methods which have, in consequence, come into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>.

This is what is meant by the fable in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aitareya Upanishad</span> which tells us that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> rejected the animal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> successively offered to them by the Divine Self and only when man was produced, cried out, \"This indeed is perfectly made,\" and consented to enter in. She has effected also a working compromise between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> of matter and the active Life that lives in and feeds on it, by which not only is vital existence sustained, but the fullest developments of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> are rendered possible. This equilibrium constitutes the basic status of Nature in man and is termed in the language of Yoga his gross body composed<span class='page-number' id='s-10' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.10]</span> of the material or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> sheath and the nervous system or vital vehicle.[^1]\n\n[^1]: *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>annakoṣa</span> and prāṇakoṣa.*\n\nIf, then, this inferior equilibrium is the basis and first means of the higher movements which the universal Power contemplates and if it constitutes the vehicle in which the Divine here seeks to reveal Itself, if the Indian saying is true that the body is the instrument provided for the fulfilment of the right law of our nature, then any final recoil from the physical life must be a turning away from the completeness of the divine Wisdom and a renunciation of its aim in earthly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>. Such a refusal may be, owing to some secret law of their development, the right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> for certain individuals, but never the aim intended for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>. It can be, therefore, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> which ignores the body or makes its annulment or its rejection indispensable to a perfect spirituality. Rather, the perfecting of the body also should be the last triumph of the Spirit and to make the bodily life also divine must be God's final seal upon His work in the universe. The obstacle which the physical presents to the spiritual is no argument for the rejection of the physical; for in the unseen providence of things our greatest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> are our best opportunities. A supreme difficulty is Nature's indication to us of a supreme conquest to be won and an ultimate problem to be solved; it is not a warning of an inextricable snare to be shunned or of an enemy too strong for us from whom we must flee.\n\nEqually, the vital and nervous energies in us are there for a great utility; they too demand the divine realisation of their possibilities in our ultimate fulfilment. The great part assigned to this element in the universal scheme is powerfully emphasised by the catholic wisdom of the Upanishads. \"As the spokes of a wheel in its nave, so in the Life-Energy is all established, the triple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and the Sacrifice and the power of the strong and the purity of the wise.

Their purification, not their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span>,—their transformation, control and utilisation is the aim in view with which they have been created and developed in us.\n\n[^2]: Prasna Upanishad II. 6 and 13.\n\nIf the bodily life is what Nature has firmly evolved for us as her base and first instrument, it is our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span> that she is evolving as her immediate next aim and superior instrument. This in her ordinary exaltations is the lofty preoccupying thought in her; this, except in her periods of exhaustion and recoil into a reposeful and recuperating obscurity, is her constant pursuit wherever she can get free from the trammels of her first vital and physical realisations. For here in man we have a distinction which is of the utmost importance. He has in him not a single mentality, but a double and a triple, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> material and nervous, the pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectual mind</span> which liberates itself from the illusions of the body and the senses, and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine mind</span> above <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> which in its turn liberates itself from the imperfect modes of the logically discriminative and imaginative reason. Mind in man is first emmeshed in the life of the body, where in the plant it is entirely involved and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span> always imprisoned. It accepts this life as not only the first but the whole condition of its activities and serves its needs as if they were the entire aim of existence. But the bodily life in man is a base, not the aim, his first condition and not his last determinant. In the just idea of the ancients man is essentially the thinker, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Manu</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> who leads the life and the body,[^3] not the animal who is led by them. The true human existence, therefore, only begins when the intellectual mentality emerges out of the material and we begin more and more to live in the mind independent of the nervous and physical obsession and in the measure of that liberty are able to accept rightly and rightly to use the life of the body. For <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and not a skilful subjection is the true means of mastery. A free, not a compulsory acceptance of the conditions, the enlarged and sublimated conditions of our physical being, is the high human ideal. But beyond this intellectual mentality is the divine.\n\n[^3]: *manomayaḥ prāṇaśarīranetā.*\n\n  <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mundaka Upanishad</span> II. 2. 8.\n\nThe mental life thus evolving in man is not, indeed, a<span class='page-number' id='s-12' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.12]</span> common possession. In actual appearance it would seem as if it were only developed to the fullest in individuals and as if there were great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and even the majority in whom it is either a small and ill-organised part of their normal nature or not evolved at all or latent and not easily made active. Certainly, the mental life is not a finished evolution of Nature; it is not yet firmly founded in the human animal. The sign is that the fine and full equilibrium of vitality and matter, the sane, robust, long-lived human body is ordinarily found only in races or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> of men who reject the effort of thought, its disturbances, its tensions, or think only with the material mind. Civilised man has yet to establish an equilibrium between the fully active mind and the body; he does not normally possess it. Indeed, the increasing effort towards a more intense mental life seems to create, frequently, an increasing disequilibrium of the human elements, so that it is possible for eminent scientists to describe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> as a form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>insanity</span>, a result of degeneration, a pathological morbidity of Nature. The phenomena which are used to justify this exaggeration, when taken not separately, but in connection with all other relevant data, point to a different truth. Genius is one attempt of the universal Energy to so quicken and intensify our intellectual powers that they shall be prepared for those more puissant, direct and rapid faculties which constitute the play of the supra-intellectual or divine mind. It is not, then, a freak, an inexplicable phenomenon, but a perfectly natural next step in the right line of her evolution. She has harmonised the bodily life with the material mind, she is harmonising it with the play of the intellectual mentality; for that, although it tends to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span> of the full animal and vital vigour, need not produce active disturbances. And she is shooting yet beyond in the attempt to reach a still higher level. Nor are the disturbances created by her process as great as is often represented. Some of them are the crude beginnings of new manifestations; others are an easily corrected movement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span>, often fruitful of fresh activities and always a small price to pay for the far-reaching results that she has in view.\n\nWe may perhaps, if we consider all the circumstances, come<span class='page-number' id='s-13' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.13]</span> to this conclusion that mental life, far from being a recent appearance in man, is the swift repetition in him of a previous achievement from which the Energy in the race had undergone one of her deplorable recoils. The savage is perhaps not so much the first forefather of civilised man as the degenerate descendant of a previous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. For if the actuality of intellectual achievement is unevenly distributed, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> is spread everywhere. It has been seen that in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> cases even the racial type considered by us the lowest, the negro fresh from the perennial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>barbarism</span> of Central <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Africa</span>, is capable, without admixture of blood, without waiting for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> generations, of the intellectual culture, if not yet of the intellectual accomplishment of the dominant European. Even in the mass men seem to need, in favourable circumstances, only a few generations to cover ground that ought apparently to be measured in the terms of millenniums. Either, then, man by his privilege as a mental being is exempt from the full burden of the tardy laws of evolution or else he already represents and with helpful conditions and in the right stimulating atmosphere can always display a high level of material capacity for the activities of the intellectual life. It is not mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span>, but the long rejection or seclusion from opportunity and withdrawal of the awakening impulse that creates the savage. Barbarism is an intermediate sleep, not an original darkness.\n\nMoreover the whole trend of modern thought and modern endeavour reveals itself to the observant eye as a large conscious effort of Nature in man to effect a general level of intellectual equipment, capacity and farther possibility by universalising the opportunities which modern civilisation affords for the mental life. Even the preoccupation of the European intellect, the protagonist of this tendency, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span> and the externalities of existence is a necessary part of the effort. It seeks to prepare a sufficient basis in man's physical being and vital energies and in his material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> for his full mental possibilities. By the spread of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, by the advance of the backward races, by the elevation of depressed classes, by the multiplication of labour-saving appliances, by the movement<span class='page-number' id='s-14' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.14]</span> towards ideal social and economic conditions, by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of Science towards an improved health, longevity and sound physique in civilised humanity, the sense and drift of this vast movement translates itself in easily intelligible signs. The right or at least the ultimate means may not always be employed, but their aim is the right preliminary aim,—a sound individual and social body and the satisfaction of the legitimate needs and demands of the material mind, sufficient ease, leisure, equal opportunity, so that the whole of mankind and no longer only the favoured race, class or individual may be free to develop the emotional and intellectual being to its full capacity. At present the material and economic aim may predominate, but always, behind, there works or there waits in reserve the higher and major impulse.\n\nAnd when the preliminary conditions are satisfied, when the great endeavour has found its base, what will be the nature of that farther possibility which the activities of the intellectual life must serve? If Mind is indeed Nature's highest term, then the entire development of the rational and imaginative intellect and the harmonious satisfaction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and sensibilities must be to themselves sufficient. But if, on the contrary, man is more than a reasoning and emotional animal, if beyond that which is being evolved, there is something that has to be evolved, then it may well be that the fullness of the mental life, the suppleness, flexibility and wide capacity of the intellect, the ordered richness of emotion and sensibility may be only a passage towards the development of a higher life and of more powerful faculties which are yet to manifest and to take possession of the lower instrument, just as mind itself has so taken possession of the body that the physical being no longer lives only for its own satisfaction but provides the foundation and the materials for a superior activity.\n\nThe assertion of a higher than the mental life is the whole foundation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian philosophy</span> and its acquisition and organisation is the veritable object served by the methods of Yoga. Mind is not the last term of evolution, not an ultimate aim, but, like body, an instrument. It is even so termed in the language of<span class='page-number' id='s-15' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.15]</span> Yoga, the inner instrument.[^4] And Indian tradition asserts that this which is to be manifested is not a new term in human experience, but has been developed before and has even governed humanity in certain periods of its development. In any case, in order to be known it must at one time have been partly developed. And if since then Nature has sunk back from her achievement, the reason must always be found in some unrealised harmony, some insufficiency of the intellectual and material basis to which she has now returned, some over-specialisation of the higher to the detriment of the lower existence.\n\n[^4]: *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>antaḥkaraṇa</span>.*\n\nBut what then constitutes this higher or highest existence to which our evolution is tending? In order to answer the question we have to deal with a class of supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>, a class of unusual conceptions which it is difficult to represent accurately in any other language than the ancient Sanskrit tongue in which alone they have been to some extent systematised. The only approximate terms in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language have other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> and their use may lead to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> and even serious inaccuracies. The terminology of Yoga recognises besides the status of our physical and vital being, termed the gross body and doubly composed of the food sheath and the vital vehicle, besides the status of our mental being, termed the subtle body and singly composed of the mind sheath or mental vehicle,[^5] a third, supreme and divine status of supra-mental being, termed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>causal body</span> and composed of a fourth and a fifth vehicle[^6] which are described as those of knowledge and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>. But this knowledge is not a systematised result of mental questionings and reasonings, not a temporary arrangement of conclusions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> in the terms of the highest probability, but rather a pure self-existent and self-luminous Truth. And this bliss is not a supreme pleasure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and sensations with the experience of pain and sorrow as its background, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> also self-existent and independent of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> and particular experiences, a self-delight which is the very nature, the very stuff, as it were, of a transcendent and infinite existence.<span class='page-number' id='s-16' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.16]</span>\n\n[^5]: *manaḥ-koṣa.*\n\n[^6]: *vijñānakoṣa* and *ānandakoṣa.*\n\nDo such psychological conceptions correspond to anything real and possible? All Yoga asserts them as its ultimate experience and supreme aim. They form the governing principles of our highest possible state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>, our widest possible range of existence. There is, we say, a harmony of supreme faculties, corresponding roughly to the psychological faculties of revelation, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and intuition, yet acting not in the intuitive reason or the divine mind, but on a still higher plane, which see Truth directly face to face, or rather live in the truth of things both universal and transcendent and are its formulation and luminous activity. And these faculties are the light of a conscious existence superseding the egoistic and itself both cosmic and transcendent, the nature of which is Bliss. These are obviously divine and, as man is at present apparently constituted, superhuman states of consciousness and activity. A trinity of transcendent existence, self-awareness and self-delight[^7] is, indeed, the metaphysical description of the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>, the self-formulation, to our awakened knowledge, of the Unknowable whether conceived as a pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Impersonality</span> or as a cosmic Personality manifesting the universe. But in Yoga they are regarded also in their psychological aspects as states of subjective existence to which our waking consciousness is now alien, but which dwell in us in a superconscious plane and to which, therefore, we may always ascend.\n\n[^7]: *saccidānanda.*\n\nFor, as is indicated by the name, causal body (*kāraṇa*), as opposed to the two others which are instruments (*karaṇa*), this . crowning manifestation is also the source and effective power of all that in the actual evolution has preceded it. Our mental activities are, indeed, a derivation, selection and, so long as they are divided from the truth that is secretly their source, a deformation of the divine knowledge. Our sensations and emotions have the same relation to the Bliss, our vital forces and actions to the aspect of Will or Force assumed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span>, our physical being to the pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of that Bliss and Consciousness. The evolution which we observe and of which<span class='page-number' id='s-17' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.17]</span> we are the terrestrial summit may be considered, in a sense, as an inverse manifestation, by which these supreme Powers in their unity and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> use, develop and perfect the imperfect substance and activities of Matter, of Life and of Mind so that they, the inferior modes, may express in mutable relativity an increasing harmony of the divine and eternal states from which they are born. If this be the truth of the universe, then the goal of evolution is also its cause, it is that which is immanent in its elements and out of them is liberated. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> is surely imperfect if it is only an escape and there is no return upon the containing substance and activities to exalt and transform them. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immanence</span> itself would have no credible reason for being if it did not end in such a transfiguration. But if human mind can become capable of the glories of the divine Light, human emotion and sensibility can be transformed into the mould and assume the measure and movement of the supreme Bliss, human action not only represent but feel itself to be the motion of a divine and non-egoistic Force and the physical substance of our being sufficiently partake of the purity of the supernal essence, sufficiently unify plasticity and durable constancy to support and prolong these highest experiences and agencies, then all the long labour of Nature will end in a crowning justification and her evolutions reveal their profound significance.\n\nSo dazzling is even a glimpse of this supreme existence and so absorbing its attraction that, once seen, we feel readily justified in neglecting all else for its pursuit. Even, by an opposite exaggeration to that which sees all things in Mind and the mental life as an exclusive ideal, Mind comes to be regarded as an unworthy deformation and a supreme obstacle, the source of an illusory universe, a negation of the Truth and itself to be denied and all its works and results annulled if we desire the final liberation. But this is a half-truth which errs by regarding only the actual limitations of Mind and ignores its divine intention. The ultimate knowledge is that which perceives and accepts God in the universe as well as beyond the universe; the integral Yoga is that which, having found the Transcendent, can return upon the universe and possess it, retaining the power freely to descend<span class='page-number' id='s-18' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.18]</span> as well as ascend the great stair of existence. For if the eternal Wisdom exists at all, the faculty of Mind also must have some high use and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. That use must depend on its place in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> and in the return and that destiny must be a fulfilment and transfiguration, not a rooting out or an annulling.\n\nWe perceive, then, these three steps in Nature, a bodily life which is the basis of our existence here in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span>, a mental life into which we emerge and by which we raise the bodily to higher uses and enlarge it into a greater completeness, and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span> which is at once the goal of the other two and returns upon them to liberate them into their highest possibilities. Regarding none of them as either beyond our reach or below our nature and the destruction of none of them as essential to the ultimate attainment, we accept this liberation and fulfilment as part at least and a large and important part of the aim of Yoga.<span class='page-number' id='s-19' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.19]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-three-steps-of-nature","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Conditions of the Synthesis"}],"nxtt":"The Threefold Life","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-threefold-life","prvt":"Life and Yoga","prvu":"/cwsa/23/life-and-yoga","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-threefold-life"],"t":"The Threefold Life","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>, then, is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> or progressive self-manifestation of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> and secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, with three successive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> as her three steps of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span>.

He culminates in what he always really was, the illumined and beatific spirit which is intended at last to irradiate life and mind with its now concealed splendours.\n\nSince this is the plan of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Energy</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, the whole method and aim of our existence must work by the interaction of these three <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> in the being. As a result of their separate formulation in Nature, man has open to him a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> between three kinds of life, the ordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> existence, a life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental activity</span> and progress and the unchanging spiritual<span class='page-number' id='s-20' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.20]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span>. But he can, as he progresses, combine these three forms, resolve their discords into a harmonious rhythm and so create in himself the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span>, the perfect Man.\n\nIn ordinary Nature they have each their own characteristic and governing impulse.\n\nThe characteristic energy of bodily Life is not so much in progress as in persistence, not so much in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> self-enlargement as in self-repetition. There is, indeed, in physical Nature a progression from type to type, from the vegetable to the animal, from the animal to man; for even in inanimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> Mind is at work. But once a type is marked off physically, the chief immediate preoccupation of the terrestrial Mother seems to be to keep it in being by a constant reproduction. For Life always seeks <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>; but since individual form is impermanent and only the idea of a form is permanent in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> that creates the universe,—for there it does not perish,—such constant reproduction is the only possible material immortality. Self-preservation, self-repetition, self-multiplication are necessarily, then, the predominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span> of all material existence. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Material life</span> seems ever to move in a fixed cycle.\n\nThe characteristic energy of pure Mind is change, and the more our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> acquires elevation and organisation, the more this law of Mind assumes the aspect of a continual enlargement, improvement and better arrangement of its gains and so of a continual passage from a smaller and simpler to a larger and more complex perfection. For Mind, unlike bodily life, is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> in its field, elastic in its expansion, easily variable in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span>. Change, then, self-enlargement and self-improvement are its proper instincts. Mind too moves in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cycles</span>, but these are ever-enlarging spirals. Its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> is perfectibility, its watchword is progress.\n\nThe characteristic law of Spirit is self-existent perfection and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span>. It possesses always and in its own right the immortality which is the aim of Life and the perfection which is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of Mind. The attainment of the eternal and the realisation of that which is the same in all things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> all things, equally blissful in universe and outside it, untouched by<span class='page-number' id='s-21' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.21]</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imperfections</span> and limitations of the forms and activities in which it dwells, are the glory of the spiritual life.\n\nIn each of these forms Nature acts both individually and collectively; for the Eternal affirms Himself equally in the single form and in the group-existence, whether <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> or groupings dependent on less physical principles or the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> of all, our collective humanity. Man also may seek his own individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> from any or all of these spheres of activity, or identify himself in them with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collectivity</span> and live for it, or, rising to a truer perception of this complex universe, harmonise the individual realisation with the collective aim. For as it is the right relation of the soul with the Supreme, while it is in the universe, neither to assert egoistically its separate being nor to blot itself out in the Indefinable, but to realise its unity with the Divine and the world and unite them in the individual, so the right relation of the individual with the collectivity is neither to pursue egoistically his own material or mental progress or spiritual salvation without regard to his fellows, nor for the sake of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> to suppress or maim his proper development, but to sum up in himself all its best and completest possibilities and pour them out by thought, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and all other means on his surroundings so that the whole race may approach nearer to the attainment of its supreme personalities.\n\nIt follows that the object of the material life must be to fulfil, above all things, the vital aim of Nature. The whole aim of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material man</span> is to live, to pass from birth to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> with as much comfort or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> as may be on the way, but anyhow to live. He can subordinate this aim, but only to physical Nature's other instincts, the reproduction of the individual and the conservation of the type in the family, class or community. Self, domesticity, the accustomed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of the society and of the nation are the constituents of the material existence. Its immense importance in the economy of Nature is self-evident, and commensurate is the importance of the human type which represents it. He assures her of the safety of the framework she has made and of the orderly continuance and conservation of her past gains.\n\nBut by that very utility such men and the life they lead are<span class='page-number' id='s-22' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.22]</span> condemned to be limited, irrationally conservative and earthbound. The customary routine, the customary institutions, the inherited or habitual forms of thought,—these things are the life-breath of their nostrils. They admit and jealously defend the changes compelled by the progressive mind in the past, but combat with equal zeal the changes that are being made by it in the present. For to the material man the living progressive thinker is an ideologue, dreamer or madman. The old Semites who stoned the living prophets and adored their memories when dead, were the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incarnation</span> of this instinctive and unintelligent principle in Nature. In the ancient Indian distinction between the once born and the twice born, it is to this material man that the former description can be applied. He does Nature's inferior works; he assures the basis for her higher activities; but not to him easily are opened the glories of her second birth.\n\nYet he admits so much of spirituality as has been enforced on his customary ideas by the great religious outbursts of the past and he makes in his scheme of society a place, venerable though not often effective, for the priest or the learned theologian who can be trusted to provide him with a safe and ordinary spiritual pabulum. But to the man who would assert for himself the liberty of spiritual experience and the spiritual life, he assigns, if he admits him at all, not the vestment of the priest but the robe of the Sannyasin. Outside society let him exercise his dangerous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>. So he may even serve as a human lightning-rod receiving the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>electricity</span> of the Spirit and turning it away from the social edifice.\n\nNevertheless it is possible to make the material man and his life moderately progressive by imprinting on the material mind the custom of progress, the habit of conscious change, the fixed idea of progression as a law of life. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> by this means of progressive societies in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the greatest triumphs of Mind over Matter. But the physical nature has its revenge; for the progress made tends to be of the grosser and more outward kind and its attempts at a higher or a more rapid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> bring about great wearinesses, swift exhaustions, startling recoils.<span class='page-number' id='s-23' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.23]</span>\n\nIt is possible also to give the material man and his life a moderate spirituality by accustoming him to regard in a religious spirit all the institutions of life and its customary activities. The creation of such spiritualised communities in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> has been one of the greatest triumphs of Spirit over Matter. Yet here, too, there is a defect; for this often tends only to the creation of a religious temperament, the most outward form of spirituality. Its higher manifestations, even the most splendid and puissant, either merely increase the number of souls drawn out of social life and so impoverish it or disturb the society for a while by a momentary elevation. The truth is that neither the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> nor the spiritual impulse can suffice, divorced from each other, to overcome the immense resistance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span>. She demands their alliance in a complete effort before she will suffer a complete change in humanity. But, usually, these two great agents are unwilling to make to each other the necessary concessions.\n\nThe mental life concentrates on the aesthetic, the ethical and the intellectual activities. Essential mentality is idealistic and a seeker after perfection. The subtle self, the brilliant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>,[^1] is ever a dreamer. A dream of perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>, perfect Truth, whether seeking new forms of the Eternal or revitalising the old, is the very soul of pure mentality. But it knows not how to deal with the resistance of Matter. There it is hampered and inefficient, works by bungling experiments and has either to withdraw from the struggle or submit to the grey actuality. Or else, by studying the material life and accepting the conditions of the contest, it may succeed, but only in imposing temporarily some artificial system which infinite Nature either rends and casts aside or disfigures out of recognition or by withdrawing her assent leaves as the corpse of a dead ideal. Few and far between have been those realisations of the dreamer in Man which the world has gladly accepted, looks back to with a fond <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> and seeks, in its elements, to cherish.<span class='page-number' id='s-24' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.24]</span>\n\n[^1]: Who dwells in Dream, the inly conscious, the enjoyer of abstractions, the Brilliant.\n\n  Mandukya Upanishad 4.\n\nWhen the gulf between actual life and the temperament of the thinker is too great, we see as the result a sort of withdrawing of the Mind from life in order to act with a greater freedom in its own sphere. The poet living among his brilliant visions, the artist absorbed in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, the philosopher thinking out the problems of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> in his solitary chamber, the scientist, the scholar caring only for their studies and their experiments, were often in former days, are even now not unoften the Sannyasins of the intellect. To the work they have done for humanity, all its past bears record.\n\nBut such seclusion is justified only by some special activity. Mind finds fully its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and action only when it casts itself upon life and accepts equally its possibilities and its resistances as the means of a greater self-perfection. In the struggle with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span> the ethical development of the individual is firmly shaped and the great schools of conduct are formed; by contact with the facts of life Art attains to vitality, Thought assures its abstractions, the generalisations of the philosopher base themselves on a stable foundation of science and experience.\n\nThis mixing with life may, however, be pursued for the sake of the individual mind and with an entire indifference to the forms of the material existence or the uplifting of the race. This indifference is seen at its highest in the Epicurean <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> and is not entirely absent from the Stoic; and even <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>altruism</span> does the works of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> more often for its own sake than for the sake of the world it helps. But this too is a limited fulfilment. The progressive mind is seen at its noblest when it strives to elevate the whole race to its own level whether by sowing broadcast the image of its own thought and fulfilment or by changing the material life of the race into fresh forms, religious, intellectual, social or political, intended to represent more nearly that ideal of truth, beauty, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, righteousness with which the man's own soul is illumined. Failure in such a field matters little; for the mere attempt is dynamic and creative. The struggle of Mind to elevate life is the promise and condition of the conquest of life by that which is higher even than Mind.<span class='page-number' id='s-25' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.25]</span>\n\nThat highest thing, the spiritual existence, is concerned with what is eternal but not therefore entirely aloof from the transient. For the spiritual man the mind's dream of perfect beauty is realised in an eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, beauty and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> that has no dependence and is equal behind all objective appearances; its dream of perfect Truth in the supreme, self-existent, self-apparent and eternal Verity which never varies, but explains and is the secret of all variations and the goal of all progress; its dream of perfect action in the omnipotent and self-guiding Law that is inherent for ever in all things and translates itself here in the rhythm of the worlds. What is fugitive vision or constant effort of creation in the brilliant Self is an eternally existing Reality in the Self that knows[^2] and is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>.\n\n[^2]: The Unified, in whom conscious thought is concentrated, who is all delight and enjoyer of delight, the Wise.... He is the Lord of all, the Omniscient, the inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guide</span>.\n\n  Mandukya Upanishad 5, 6.\n\nBut if it is often difficult for the mental life to accommodate itself to the dully resistant material activity, how much more difficult must it seem for the spiritual existence to live on in a world that appears full not of the Truth but of every lie and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, not of Love and Beauty but of an encompassing discord and ugliness, not of the Law of Truth but of victorious selfishness and sin? Therefore the spiritual life tends easily in the saint and Sannyasin to withdraw from the material existence and reject it either wholly and physically or in the spirit. It sees this world as the kingdom of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> or of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and the eternal and divine either in a far-off heaven or beyond where there is no world and no life. It separates itself inwardly, if not also physically, from the world's impurities; it asserts the spiritual reality in a spotless isolation. This withdrawal renders an invaluable service to the material life itself by forcing it to regard and even to bow down to something that is the direct negation of its own petty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, sordid cares and egoistic self-content.\n\nBut the work in the world of so supreme a power as spiritual force cannot be thus limited. The spiritual life also can return upon the material and use it as a means of its own greater<span class='page-number' id='s-26' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.26]</span> fullness. Refusing to be blinded by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span>, the appearances, it can seek in all appearances whatsoever the vision of the same Lord, the same eternal Truth, Beauty, Love, Delight. The Vedantic formula of the Self in all things, all things in the Self and all things as becomings of the Self is the key to this richer and all-embracing Yoga.\n\nBut the spiritual life, like the mental, may thus make use of this outward existence for the benefit of the individual with a perfect indifference to any collective uplifting of the merely symbolic world which it uses. Since the Eternal is for ever the same in all things and all things the same to the Eternal, since the exact mode of action and the result are of no importance compared with the working out in oneself of the one great realisation, this spiritual indifference accepts no matter what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, no matter what action, dispassionately, prepared to retire as soon as its own supreme end is realised. It is so that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> have understood the ideal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>. Or else the inner love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> may pour itself out on the world in good deeds, in service, in compassion, the inner Truth in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, without therefore attempting the transformation of a world which must by its inalienable nature remain a battlefield of the dualities, of sin and virtue, of truth and error, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and suffering.\n\nBut if Progress also is one of the chief terms of world-existence and a progressive manifestation of the Divine the true sense of Nature, this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> also is invalid. It is possible for the spiritual life in the world, and it is its real mission, to change the material life into its own image, the image of the Divine. Therefore, besides the great solitaries who have sought and attained their self-liberation, we have the great spiritual teachers who have also liberated others and, supreme of all, the great dynamic souls who, feeling themselves stronger in the might of the Spirit than all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of the material life banded together, have thrown themselves upon the world, grappled with it in a loving wrestle and striven to compel its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to its own transfiguration. Ordinarily, the effort is concentrated on a mental and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral change</span> in humanity, but it may extend itself<span class='page-number' id='s-27' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.27]</span> also to the alteration of the forms of our life and its institutions so that they too may be a better mould for the inpourings of the Spirit. These attempts have been the supreme landmarks in the progressive development of human ideals and the divine preparation of the race. Every one of them, whatever its outward results, has left Earth more capable of Heaven and quickened in its tardy movements the evolutionary Yoga of Nature.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, for the last thousand years and more, the spiritual life and the material have existed side by side to the exclusion of the progressive mind. Spirituality has made terms for itself with Matter by renouncing the attempt at general progress. It has obtained from society the right of free spiritual development for all who assume some distinctive symbol, such as the garb of the Sannyasin, the recognition of that life as man's goal and those who live it as worthy of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> reverence, and the casting of society itself into such a religious mould that its most customary acts should be accompanied by a formal reminder of the spiritual symbolism of life and its ultimate destination. On the other hand, there was conceded to society the right of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> and immobile self-conservation. The concession destroyed much of the value of the terms. The religious mould being fixed, the formal reminder tended to become a routine and to lose its living sense. The constant attempts to change the mould by new sects and religions ended only in a new routine or a modification of the old; for the saving element of the free and active mind had been exiled. The material life, handed over to the Ignorance, the purposeless and endless duality, became a leaden and dolorous yoke from which flight was the only escape.\n\nThe schools of Indian Yoga lent themselves to the compromise. Individual perfection or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> was made the aim, seclusion of some kind from the ordinary activities the condition, the renunciation of life the culmination. The teacher gave his knowledge only to a small circle of disciples. Or if a wider movement was attempted, it was still the release of the individual soul that remained the aim. The pact with an immobile society was, for the most part, observed.\n\nThe utility of the compromise in the then actual state of the<span class='page-number' id='s-28' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.28]</span> world cannot be doubted. It secured in India a society which lent itself to the preservation and the worship of spirituality, a country apart in which as in a fortress the highest spiritual ideal could maintain itself in its most absolute purity unoverpowered by the siege of the forces around it. But it was a compromise, not an absolute victory. The material life lost the divine impulse to growth, the spiritual preserved by isolation its height and purity, but sacrificed its full power and serviceableness to the world. Therefore, in the divine Providence the country of the Yogins and the Sannyasins has been forced into a strict and imperative contact with the very element it had rejected, the element of the progressive Mind, so that it might recover what was now wanting to it.\n\nWe have to recognise once more that the individual exists not in himself alone but in the collectivity and that individual perfection and liberation are not the whole sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s intention in the world. The free use of our liberty includes also the liberation of others and of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>; the perfect utility of our perfection is, having realised in ourselves the divine symbol, to reproduce, multiply and ultimately universalise it in others.\n\nTherefore from a concrete view of human life in its threefold potentialities we come to the same conclusion that we had drawn from an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> of Nature in her general workings and the three steps of her evolution. And we begin to perceive a complete aim for our synthesis of Yoga.\n\nSpirit is the crown of universal existence; Matter is its basis; Mind is the link between the two. Spirit is that which is eternal; Mind and Matter are its workings. Spirit is that which is concealed and has to be revealed; mind and body are the means by which it seeks to reveal itself. Spirit is the image of the Lord of the Yoga; mind and body are the means He has provided for reproducing that image in phenomenal existence. All Nature is an attempt at a progressive revelation of the concealed Truth, a more and more successful reproduction of the divine image.\n\nBut what Nature aims at for the mass in a slow evolution, Yoga effects for the individual by a rapid revolution. It works by a quickening of all her energies, a sublimation of all her<span class='page-number' id='s-29' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.29]</span> faculties. While she develops the spiritual life with difficulty and has constantly to fall back from it for the sake of her lower realisations, the sublimated force, the concentrated method of Yoga can attain directly and carry with it the perfection of the mind and even, if she will, the perfection of the body. Nature seeks the Divine in her own symbols: Yoga goes beyond Nature to the Lord of Nature, beyond universe to the Transcendent and can return with the transcendent light and power, with the fiat of the Omnipotent.\n\nBut their aim is one in the end. The generalisation of Yoga in humanity must be the last victory of Nature over her own delays and concealments. Even as now by the progressive mind in Science she seeks to make all mankind fit for the full development of the mental life, so by Yoga must she inevitably seek to make all mankind fit for the higher evolution, the second birth, the spiritual existence. And as the mental life uses and perfects the material, so will the spiritual use and perfect the material and the mental existence as the instruments of a divine self-expression. The ages when that is accomplished, are the legendary Satya or Krita[^3] Yugas, the ages of the Truth manifested in the symbol, of the great work done when Nature in mankind, illumined, satisfied and blissful, rests in the culmination of her endeavour.\n\n[^3]: Satya means Truth; Krita, effected or completed.\n\nIt is for man to know her meaning, no longer misunderstanding, vilifying or misusing the universal Mother, and to aspire always by her mightiest means to her highest ideal.<span class='page-number' id='s-30' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.30]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-threefold-life","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Conditions of the Synthesis"}],"nxtt":"The Systems of Yoga","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-systems-of-yoga","prvt":"The Three Steps of Nature","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-three-steps-of-nature","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-systems-of-yoga"],"t":"The Systems of Yoga","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"These relations between the different psychological divisions of the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> and these various utilities and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> founded on them, such as we have seen them in our brief survey of the natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>, we shall find repeated in the fundamental principles and methods of the different schools of Yoga.

But in the highest flights of Yoga she reaches beyond herself and realises the Divine in Itself exceeding the universe and even standing apart from the cosmic play. Therefore by some it is supposed that this is not only the highest but also the one true or exclusively preferable object of Yoga.\n\nYet it is always through something which she has formed in her evolution that Nature thus overpasses her evolution. It is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> that by sublimating its highest and purest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> attains to the transcendent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> or the ineffable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>, the individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> that by converting its ordinary functionings into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> beyond <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> knows its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with the Ineffable and merges its separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in that transcendent unity. And always it is the individual, the Self conditioned in its experience by Nature and working through her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span>, that attains to the Self unconditioned, free and transcendent.\n\nIn practice three conceptions are necessary before there can be any possibility of Yoga; there must be, as it were, three consenting parties to the effort,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, Nature and the human soul or, in more abstract language, the Transcendental, the Universal<span class='page-number' id='s-31' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.31]</span> and the Individual. If the individual and Nature are left to themselves, the one is bound to the other and unable to exceed appreciably her lingering march. Something transcendent is needed, free from her and greater, which will act upon us and her, attracting us upward to Itself and securing from her by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> or by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to the individual ascension.\n\nIt is this truth which makes necessary to every philosophy of Yoga the conception of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>, supreme Soul or supreme Self, towards whom the effort is directed and who gives the illuminating touch and the strength to attain. Equally true is the complementary idea so often enforced by the Yoga of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> that as the Transcendent is necessary to the individual and sought after by him, so also the individual is necessary in a sense to the Transcendent and sought after by It. If the Bhakta seeks and yearns after Bhagavan, Bhagavan also seeks and yearns after the Bhakta.[^1] There can be no Yoga of knowledge without a human seeker of the knowledge, the supreme subject of knowledge and the divine use by the individual of the universal faculties of knowledge; no Yoga of devotion without the human God-lover, the supreme object of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and the divine use by the individual of the universal faculties of spiritual, emotional and aesthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span>; no Yoga of works without the human worker, the supreme Will, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> works and sacrifices, and the divine use by the individual of the universal faculties of power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. However Monistic may be our intellectual conception of the highest truth of things, in practice we are compelled to accept this omnipresent Trinity.\n\n[^1]: Bhakta, the devotee or lover of God; Bhagavan, God, the Lord of Love and Delight. The third term of the trinity is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhagavat</span>, the divine revelation of Love.\n\nFor the contact of the human and individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> with the divine is the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of Yoga. Yoga is the union of that which has become separated in the play of the universe with its own true self, origin and universality. The contact may take place at any point of the complex and intricately organised consciousness which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> our personality. It may be effected in the physical through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>; in the vital through the action of<span class='page-number' id='s-32' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.32]</span> those functionings which determine the state and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> of our nervous being; through the mentality, whether by means of the emotional heart, the active will or the understanding mind, or more largely by a general <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> of the mental consciousness in all its activities. It may equally be accomplished through a direct awakening to the universal or transcendent Truth and Bliss by the conversion of the central <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> in the mind. And according to the point of contact that we choose will be the type of the Yoga that we practise.\n\nFor if, leaving aside the complexities of their particular processes, we fix our regard on the central principle of the chief schools of Yoga still prevalent in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, we find that they arrange themselves in an ascending <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> which starts from the lowest rung of the ladder, the body, and ascends to the direct contact between the individual soul and the transcendent and universal Self. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hathayoga</span> selects the body and the vital functionings as its instruments of perfection and realisation; its concern is with the gross body. Rajayoga selects the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> in its different parts as its lever-power; it concentrates on the subtle body. The triple Path of Works, of Love and of Knowledge uses some part of the mental being, will, heart or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> as a starting-point and seeks by its conversion to arrive at the liberating Truth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beatitude</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinity</span> which are the nature of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. Its method is a direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> between the human Purusha in the individual body and the divine Purusha who dwells in every body and yet transcends all form and name.\n\nHathayoga aims at the conquest of the life and the body whose combination in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> sheath and the vital vehicle constitutes, as we have seen, the gross body and whose equilibrium is the foundation of all Nature's workings in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>. The equilibrium established by Nature is sufficient for the normal egoistic life; it is insufficient for the purpose of the Hathayogin. For it is calculated on the amount of vital or dynamic force necessary to drive the physical engine during the normal span of human life and to perform more or less adequately the various workings demanded of it by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual life</span> inhabiting this frame and the world-environment by which it is conditioned.<span class='page-number' id='s-33' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.33]</span> Hathayoga therefore seeks to rectify Nature and establish another equilibrium by which the physical frame will be able to sustain the inrush of an increasing vital or dynamic force of Prana indefinite, almost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> in its quantity or intensity. In Nature the equilibrium is based upon the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individualisation</span> of a limited quantity and force of the Prana; more than that the individual is by personal and hereditary habit unable to bear, use or control. In Hathayoga, the equilibrium opens a door to the universalisation of the individual vitality by admitting into the body, containing, using and controlling a much less fixed and limited action of the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>.\n\nThe chief processes of Hathayoga are *āsana* and *prāṇāyāma*. By its numerous *āsanas* or fixed postures it first cures the body of that restlessness which is a sign of its inability to contain without working them off in action and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> the vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> poured into it from the universal Life-Ocean, gives to it an extraordinary health, force and suppleness and seeks to liberate it from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> by which it is subjected to ordinary physical Nature and kept within the narrow bounds of her normal operations. In the ancient tradition of Hathayoga it has always been supposed that this conquest could be pushed so far even as to conquer to a great extent the force of gravitation. By various subsidiary but elaborate processes the Hathayogin next contrives to keep the body free from all impurities and the nervous system unclogged for those exercises of respiration which are his most important instruments. These are called *prāṇāyāma*, the control of the breath or vital power; for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>breathing</span> is the chief physical functioning of the vital forces. Pranayama, for the Hathayogin, serves a double purpose. First, it completes the perfection of the body. The vitality is liberated from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> of the ordinary necessities of physical Nature; robust health, prolonged youth, often an extraordinary longevity are attained. On the other hand, Pranayama awakens the coiled-up serpent of the Pranic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dynamism</span> in the vital sheath and opens to the Yogin fields of consciousness, ranges of experience, abnormal faculties denied to the ordinary human life while it puissantly intensifies such normal powers and faculties as he already possesses.<span class='page-number' id='s-34' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.34]</span> These advantages can be farther secured and emphasised by other subsidiary processes open to the Hathayogin.\n\nThe results of Hathayoga are thus striking to the eye and impose easily on the vulgar or physical mind. And yet at the end we may ask what we have gained at the end of all this stupendous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span>. The object of physical Nature, the preservation of the mere physical life, its highest perfection, even in a certain sense the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of a greater enjoyment of physical living have been carried out on an abnormal scale. But the weakness of Hathayoga is that its laborious and difficult processes make so great a demand on the time and energy and impose so complete a severance from the ordinary life of men that the utilisation of its results for the life of the world becomes either impracticable or is extraordinarily restricted. If in return for this loss we gain another life in another world within, the mental, the dynamic, these results could have been acquired through other systems, through Rajayoga, through Tantra, by much less laborious methods and held on much less exacting terms. On the other hand the physical results, increased vitality, prolonged youth, health, longevity are of small avail if they must be held by us as misers of ourselves, apart from the common life, for their own sake, not utilised, not thrown into the common sum of the world's activities. Hathayoga attains large results, but at an exorbitant price and to very little purpose.\n\nRajayoga takes a higher flight. It aims at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> and perfection not of the bodily, but of the mental being, the control of the emotional and sensational life, the mastery of the whole apparatus of thought and consciousness. It fixes its eyes on the *citta*, that stuff of mental consciousness in which all these activities arise, and it seeks, even as Hathayoga with its physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>, first to purify and to tranquillise. The normal state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is a condition of trouble and disorder, a kingdom either at war with itself or badly governed; for the lord, the Purusha, is subjected to his ministers, the faculties, subjected even to his subjects, the instruments of sensation, emotion, action, enjoyment. Swarajya, self-rule, must be substituted for this subjection. First, therefore, the powers of order must be helped to overcome<span class='page-number' id='s-35' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.35]</span> the powers of disorder. The preliminary movement of Rajayoga is a careful self-discipline by which good habits of mind are substituted for the lawless movements that indulge the lower nervous being. By the practice of truth, by renunciation of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of egoistic seeking, by abstention from injury to others, by purity, by constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> and inclination to the divine Purusha who is the true lord of the mental kingdom, a pure, glad, clear state of mind and heart is established.\n\nThis is the first step only. Afterwards, the ordinary activities of the mind and sense must be entirely quieted in order that the soul may be free to ascend to higher states of consciousness and acquire the foundation for a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and self-mastery. But Rajayoga does not forget that the disabilities of the ordinary mind proceed largely from its subjection to the reactions of the nervous system and the body. It adopts therefore from the Hathayogic system its devices of *āsana* and *prāṇāyāma*, but reduces their multiple and elaborate forms in each case to one simplest and most directly effective process sufficient for its own immediate object. Thus it gets rid of the Hathayogic complexity and cumbrousness while it utilises the swift and powerful efficacy of its methods for the control of the body and the vital functions and for the awakening of that internal dynamism, full of a latent supernormal faculty, typified in Yogic terminology by the *kuṇḍalinī*, the coiled and sleeping serpent of Energy within. This done, the system proceeds to the perfect quieting of the restless mind and its elevation to a higher plane through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of mental force by the successive stages which lead to the utmost inner concentration or ingathered state of the consciousness which is called Samadhi.\n\nBy Samadhi, in which the mind acquires the capacity of withdrawing from its limited waking activities into freer and higher states of consciousness, Rajayoga serves a double purpose. It compasses a pure mental action liberated from the confusions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer consciousness</span> and passes thence to the higher supra-mental planes on which the individual soul enters into its true spiritual existence. But also it acquires the capacity of that free and concentrated energising of consciousness on<span class='page-number' id='s-36' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.36]</span> its object which our philosophy asserts as the primary cosmic energy and the method of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span> upon the world. By this capacity the Yogin, already possessed of the highest supracosmic knowledge and experience in the state of trance, is able in the waking state to acquire directly whatever knowledge and exercise whatever mastery may be useful or necessary to his activities in the objective world. For the ancient system of Rajayoga aimed not only at Swarajya, self-rule or subjective empire, the entire control by the subjective consciousness of all the states and activities proper to its own domain, but included Samrajya as well, outward empire, the control by the subjective consciousness of its outer activities and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>.\n\nWe perceive that as Hathayoga, dealing with the life and body, aims at the supernormal perfection of the physical life and its capacities and goes beyond it into the domain of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span>, so Rajayoga, operating with the mind, aims at a supernormal perfection and enlargement of the capacities of the mental life and goes beyond it into the domain of the spiritual existence. But the weakness of the system lies in its excessive reliance on abnormal states of trance. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> leads first to a certain aloofness from the physical life which is our foundation and the sphere into which we have to bring our mental and spiritual gains. Especially is the spiritual life, in this system, too much associated with the state of Samadhi. Our object is to make the spiritual life and its experiences fully active and fully utilisable in the waking state and even in the normal use of the functions. But in Rajayoga it tends to withdraw into a subliminal plane at the back of our normal experiences instead of descending and possessing our whole existence.\n\nThe triple Path of devotion, knowledge and works attempts the province which Rajayoga leaves unoccupied. It differs from Rajayoga in that it does not occupy itself with the elaborate training of the whole mental system as the condition of perfection, but seizes on certain central principles, the intellect, the heart, the will, and seeks to convert their normal operations by turning them away from their ordinary and external preoccupations and activities and concentrating them on the Divine. It<span class='page-number' id='s-37' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.37]</span> differs also in this,—and here from the point of view of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> there seems to be a defect,—that it is indifferent to mental and bodily perfection and aims only at purity as a condition of the divine realisation. A second defect is that as actually practised it chooses one of the three parallel paths exclusively and almost in antagonism to the others instead of effecting a synthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of the intellect, the heart and the will in an integral divine realisation.\n\nThe Path of Knowledge aims at the realisation of the unique and supreme Self. It proceeds by the method of intellectual reflection, *vicāra*, to right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span>, *viveka*. It observes and distinguishes the different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of our apparent or phenomenal being and rejecting identification with each of them arrives at their exclusion and separation in one common term as constituents of Prakriti, of phenomenal Nature, creations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>, the phenomenal consciousness. So it is able to arrive at its right identification with the pure and unique Self which is not mutable or perishable, not determinable by any phenomenon or combination of phenomena. From this point the path, as ordinarily followed, leads to the rejection of the phenomenal worlds from the consciousness as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> and the final immergence without return of the individual soul in the Supreme.\n\nBut this exclusive consummation is not the sole or inevitable result of the Path of Knowledge. For, followed more largely and with a less individual aim, the method of Knowledge may lead to an active conquest of the cosmic existence for the Divine no less than to a transcendence. The point of this departure is the realisation of the supreme Self not only in one's own being but in all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> and, finally, the realisation of even the phenomenal aspects of the world as a play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> and not something entirely alien to its true nature. And on the basis of this realisation a yet further enlargement is possible, the conversion of all forms of knowledge, however mundane, into activities of the divine consciousness utilisable for the perception of the one and unique Object of knowledge both in itself and through the play of its forms and symbols. Such a method might well lead to the elevation of the whole range of human intellect<span class='page-number' id='s-38' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.38]</span> and perception to the divine level, to its spiritualisation and to the justification of the cosmic travail of knowledge in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>.\n\nThe Path of Devotion aims at the enjoyment of the supreme Love and Bliss and utilises normally the conception of the supreme Lord in His personality as the divine Lover and enjoyer of the universe. The world is then realised as a play of the Lord, with our human life as its final stage, pursued through the different phases of self-concealment and self-revelation. The principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhakti</span> Yoga is to utilise all the normal relations of human life into which emotion enters and apply them no longer to transient worldly relations, but to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of the All-Loving, the All-Beautiful and the All-Blissful. Worship and meditation are used only for the preparation and increase of intensity of the divine relationship. And this Yoga is catholic in its use of all emotional relations, so that even enmity and opposition to God, considered as an intense, impatient and perverse form of Love, is conceived as a possible means of realisation and salvation. This path, too, as ordinarily practised, leads away from world-existence to an absorption, of another kind than the Monist's, in the Transcendent and Supra-cosmic.\n\nBut, here too, the exclusive result is not inevitable. The Yoga itself provides a first corrective by not confining the play of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> to the relation between the supreme Soul and the individual, but extending it to a common feeling and mutual worship between the devotees themselves united in the same realisation of the supreme Love and Bliss. It provides a yet more general corrective in the realisation of the divine object of Love in all beings not only human but animal, easily extended to all forms whatsoever. We can see how this larger application of the Yoga of Devotion may be so used as to lead to the elevation of the whole range of human emotion, sensation and aesthetic perception to the divine level, its spiritualisation and the justification of the cosmic labour towards love and joy in our humanity.\n\nThe Path of Works aims at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dedication</span> of every human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> to the supreme Will. It begins by the renunciation of all egoistic aim for our works, all pursuit of action for an interested aim or for the sake of a worldly result. By this renunciation it so<span class='page-number' id='s-39' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.39]</span> purifies the mind and the will that we become easily conscious of the great universal Energy as the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> of all our actions and the Lord of that Energy as their ruler and director with the individual as only a mask, an excuse, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> or, more positively, a conscious centre of action and phenomenal relation. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> and direction of the act is more and more consciously left to this supreme Will and this universal Energy. To That our works as well as the results of our works are finally abandoned. The object is the release of the soul from its bondage to appearances and to the reaction of phenomenal activities. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Karmayoga</span> is used, like the other paths, to lead to liberation from phenomenal existence and a departure into the Supreme. But here too the exclusive result is not inevitable. The end of the path may be, equally, a perception of the Divine in all energies, in all happenings, in all activities, and a free and unegoistic participation of the soul in the cosmic action. So followed it will lead to the elevation of all human will and activity to the divine level, its spiritualisation and the justification of the cosmic labour towards freedom, power and perfection in the human being.\n\nWe can see also that in the integral view of things these three paths are one. Divine Love should normally lead to the perfect knowledge of the Beloved by perfect intimacy, thus <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> a path of Knowledge, and to divine service, thus becoming a path of Works. So also should perfect Knowledge lead to perfect Love and Joy and a full acceptance of the works of That which is known; dedicated Works to the entire love of the Master of the Sacrifice and the deepest knowledge of His ways and His being. It is in this triple path that we come most readily to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> knowledge, love and service of the One in all beings and in the entire cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-40' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.40]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-systems-of-yoga","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Conditions of the Synthesis"}],"nxtt":"The Synthesis of the Systems","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-systems","prvt":"The Threefold Life","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-threefold-life","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-synthesis-of-the-systems"],"t":"The Synthesis of the Systems","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"By the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the principal Yogic schools, each covering in its operations a part of the complex human integer and attempting to bring out its highest possibilities, it will appear that a synthesis of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> of them largely conceived and applied might well result in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>. But they are so disparate in their tendencies, so highly specialised and elaborated in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, so long confirmed in the mutual opposition of their ideas and methods that we do not easily find how we can arrive at their right union.\n\nAn undiscriminating combination in block would not be a synthesis, but a confusion. Nor would a successive practice of each of them in turn be easy in the short span of our human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and with our limited energies, to say nothing of the waste of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> implied in so cumbrous a process. Sometimes, indeed, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hathayoga</span> and Rajayoga are thus successively practised. And in a recent unique example, in the life of Ramakrishna Paramhansa, we see a colossal spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> first driving straight to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> realisation, taking, as it were, the kingdom of heaven by violence, and then seizing upon <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> Yogic method after another and extracting the substance out of it with an incredible rapidity, always to return to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, the realisation and possession of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> by the power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, by the extension of inborn spirituality into various experience and by the spontaneous play of an intuitive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>. Such an example cannot be generalised. Its object also was special and temporal, to exemplify in the great and decisive experience of a master-soul the truth, now most necessary to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, towards which a world long divided into jarring sects and schools is with difficulty labouring, that all sects are forms and fragments of a single integral truth and all disciplines labour in their different ways towards one supreme experience. To know, be and possess<span class='page-number' id='s-41' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.41]</span> the Divine is the one thing needful and it includes or leads up to all the rest; towards this sole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> we have to drive and this attained, all the rest that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> chooses for us, all necessary form and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>, will be added.\n\nThe synthesis we propose cannot, then, be arrived at either by combination in mass or by successive practice. It must therefore be effected by neglecting the forms and outsides of the Yogic disciplines and seizing rather on some central principle common to all which will include and utilise in the right place and proportion their particular principles, and on some central dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> which is the common secret of their divergent methods and capable therefore of organising a natural selection and combination of their varied energies and different utilities. This was the aim which we set before ourselves at first when we entered upon our comparative examination of the methods of Nature and the methods of Yoga and we now return to it with the possibility of hazarding some definite solution.\n\nWe observe, first, that there still exists in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> a remarkable Yogic system which is in its nature synthetical and starts from a great central principle of Nature, a great dynamic force of Nature; but it is a Yoga apart, not a synthesis of other schools. This system is the way of the Tantra. Owing to certain of its developments Tantra has fallen into discredit with those who are not Tantrics; and especially owing to the developments of its left-hand path, the Vama Marga, which not content with exceeding the duality of virtue and sin and instead of replacing them by spontaneous rightness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> seemed, sometimes, to make a method of self-indulgence, a method of unrestrained social immorality. Nevertheless, in its origin, Tantra was a great and puissant system founded upon ideas which were at least partially true. Even its twofold <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> into the right-hand and left-hand paths, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dakshina</span> Marga and Vama Marga, started from a certain profound perception. In the ancient symbolic sense of the words Dakshina and Vama, it was the distinction between the way of Knowledge and the way of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>,—Nature in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> liberating itself by right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span> in power and practice of its own energies, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> and potentialities and Nature in man<span class='page-number' id='s-42' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.42]</span> liberating itself by joyous acceptance in power and practice of its own energies, elements and potentialities. But in both paths there was in the end an obscuration of principles, a deformation of symbols and a fall.\n\nIf, however, we leave aside, here also, the actual methods and practices and seek for the central principle, we find, first, that Tantra expressly differentiates itself from the Vedic methods of Yoga. In a sense, all the schools we have hitherto examined are Vedantic in their principle; their force is in knowledge, their method is knowledge, though it is not always discernment by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, but may be, instead, the knowledge of the heart expressed in love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> or a knowledge in the will working out through action. In all of them the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of the Yoga is the Purusha, the Conscious Soul that knows, observes, attracts, governs. But in Tantra it is rather Prakriti, the Nature-Soul, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Energy</span>, the Will-in-Power executive in the universe. It was by learning and applying the intimate secrets of this Will-in-Power, its method, its Tantra, that the Tantric Yogin pursued the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span>,—mastery, perfection, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span>. Instead of drawing back from manifested Nature and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span>, he confronted them, seized and conquered. But in the end, as is the general tendency of Prakriti, Tantric Yoga largely lost its principle in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> and became a thing of formulae and occult mechanism still powerful when rightly used but fallen from the clarity of their original intention.\n\nWe have in this central Tantric conception one side of the truth, the worship of the Energy, the Shakti, as the sole effective force for all attainment. We get the other extreme in the Vedantic conception of the Shakti as a power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Illusion</span> and in the search after the silent inactive Purusha as the means of liberation from the deceptions created by the active Energy. But in the integral conception the Conscious Soul is the Lord, the Nature-Soul is his executive Energy. Purusha is of the nature of Sat, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> of conscious self-existence pure and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>; Shakti or Prakriti is of the nature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit</span>,—it is power of the Purusha's self-conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, pure and infinite. The relation of the two exists between the poles of rest and action. When the Energy is absorbed<span class='page-number' id='s-43' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.43]</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of conscious self-existence, there is rest; when the Purusha pours itself out in the action of its Energy, there is action, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> or Ananda of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>. But if Ananda is the creator and begetter of all becoming, its method is Tapas or force of the Purusha's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> dwelling upon its own infinite potentiality in existence and producing from it truths of conception or real Ideas, *vijñāna*, which, proceeding from an omniscient and omnipotent Self-existence, have the surety of their own fulfilment and contain in themselves the nature and law of their own becoming in the terms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, life and matter. The eventual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>omnipotence</span> of Tapas and the infallible fulfilment of the Idea are the very foundation of all Yoga. In man we render these terms by Will and Faith,—a will that is eventually self-effective because it is of the substance of Knowledge and a faith that is the reflex in the lower consciousness of a Truth or real Idea yet unrealised in the manifestation. It is this self-certainty of the Idea which is meant by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> when it says, *yo yac-chraddhaḥ sa eva saḥ*, \"whatever is a man's faith or the sure Idea in him, that he becomes.\"\n\nWe see, then, what from the psychological point of view,—and Yoga is nothing but practical psychology,—is the conception of Nature from which we have to start. It is the self-fulfilment of the Purusha through his Energy. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of Nature is twofold, higher and lower, or, as we may choose to term it, divine and undivine. The distinction exists indeed for practical purposes only; for there is nothing that is not divine, and in a larger view it is as meaningless, verbally, as the distinction between natural and supernatural, for all things that are are natural. All things are in Nature and all things are in God. But, for practical purposes, there is a real distinction. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower Nature</span>, that which we know and are and must remain so long as the faith in us is not changed, acts through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and division, is of the nature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span> and culminates in the life of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>; but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher Nature</span>, that to which we aspire, acts by unification and transcendence of limitation, is of the nature of Knowledge and culminates in the life divine. The passage from the lower to the higher is the aim of Yoga; and this passage<span class='page-number' id='s-44' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.44]</span> may effect itself by the rejection of the lower and escape into the higher,—the ordinary view-point,—or by the transformation of the lower and its elevation to the higher Nature. It is this, rather, that must be the aim of an integral Yoga.\n\nBut in either case it is always through something in the lower that we must rise into the higher existence, and the schools of Yoga each select their own point of departure or their own gate of escape. They specialise certain activities of the lower Prakriti and turn them towards the Divine. But the normal action of Nature in us is an integral movement in which the full complexity of all our elements is affected by and affects all our environments. The whole of life is the Yoga of Nature. The Yoga that we seek must also be an integral action of Nature, and the whole difference between the Yogin and the natural man will be this, that the Yogin seeks to substitute in himself for the integral action of the lower Nature working in and by ego and division the integral action of the higher Nature working in and by God and unity. If indeed our aim be only an escape from the world to God, synthesis is unnecessary and a waste of time; for then our sole practical aim must be to find out one path out of the thousand that lead to God, one shortest possible of short cuts, and not to linger exploring different paths that end in the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>. But if our aim be a transformation of our integral being into the terms of God-existence, it is then that a synthesis becomes necessary.\n\nThe method we have to pursue, then, is to put our whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> into relation and contact with the Divine and to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> Him in to transform our entire being into His. Thus in a sense God Himself, the real Person in us, becomes the sadhaka of the sadhana[^1] as well as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of the Yoga by whom the lower personality is used as the centre of a divine transfiguration and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of its own perfection. In effect, the pressure of the Tapas, the force of consciousness in us dwelling in the Idea of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span> upon that which we are in our entirety, produces<span class='page-number' id='s-45' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.45]</span> its own realisation. The divine and all-knowing and all-effecting descends upon the limited and obscure, progressively illumines and energises the whole lower nature and substitutes its own action for all the terms of the inferior human light and mortal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>.\n\n[^1]: *Sādhana*, the practice by which perfection, *siddhi*, is attained; *sādhaka*, the Yogin who seeks by that practice the *siddhi*.\n\nIn psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> this method translates itself into the progressive surrender of the ego with its whole field and all its apparatus to the Beyond-ego with its vast and incalculable but always inevitable workings. Certainly, this is no short cut or easy sadhana. It requires a colossal faith, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> courage and above all an unflinching patience. For it implies three stages of which only the last can be wholly blissful or rapid,—the attempt of the ego to enter into contact with the Divine, the wide, full and therefore laborious preparation of the whole lower Nature by the divine working to receive and become the higher Nature, and the eventual transformation. In fact, however, the divine Strength, often unobserved and behind the veil, substitutes itself for our weakness and supports us through all our failings of faith, courage and patience. It \"makes the blind to see and the lame to stride over the hills.\" The intellect becomes aware of a Law that beneficently insists and a succour that upholds; the heart speaks of a Master of all things and Friend of man or a universal Mother who upholds through all stumblings. Therefore this path is at once the most difficult imaginable and yet, in comparison with the magnitude of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and object, the most easy and sure of all.\n\nThere are three outstanding features of this action of the higher when it works integrally on the lower nature. In the first place it does not act according to a fixed system and succession as in the specialised methods of Yoga, but with a sort of free, scattered and yet gradually intensive and purposeful working determined by the temperament of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> in whom it operates, the helpful materials which his nature offers and the obstacles which it presents to purification and perfection. In a sense, therefore, each man in this path has his own method of Yoga. Yet are there certain broad lines of working common to all which enable us to construct not indeed a routine system, but<span class='page-number' id='s-46' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.46]</span> yet some kind of Shastra or scientific method of the synthetic Yoga.\n\nSecondly, the process, being integral, accepts our nature such as it stands organised by our past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> and without rejecting anything essential compels all to undergo a divine change. Everything in us is seized by the hands of a mighty Artificer and transformed into a clear image of that which it now seeks confusedly to present. In that ever-progressive experience we begin to perceive how this lower manifestation is constituted and that everything in it, however seemingly deformed or petty or vile, is the more or less distorted or imperfect figure of some element or action in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of the divine Nature. We begin to understand what the Vedic Rishis meant when they spoke of the human forefathers fashioning the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> as a smith forges the crude <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> in his smithy.\n\nThirdly, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> in us uses all life as the means of this integral Yoga. Every experience and outer contact with our world-environment, however trifling or however disastrous, is used for the work, and every inner experience, even to the most repellent suffering or the most humiliating fall, becomes a step on the path to perfection. And we recognise in ourselves with opened eyes the method of God in the world, His purpose of light in the obscure, of might in the weak and fallen, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in what is grievous and miserable. We see the divine method to be the same in the lower and in the higher working; only in the one it is pursued tardily and obscurely through the subconscious in Nature, in the other it becomes swift and self-conscious and the instrument confesses the hand of the Master. All life is a Yoga of Nature seeking to manifest God within itself. Yoga marks the stage at which this effort becomes capable of self-awareness and therefore of right completion in the individual. It is a gathering up and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of the movements dispersed and loosely combined in the lower evolution.\n\nAn integral method and an integral result. First, an integral realisation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Being</span>; not only a realisation of the One in its indistinguishable unity, but also in its multitude of aspects which are also necessary to the complete knowledge of it by<span class='page-number' id='s-47' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.47]</span> the relative consciousness; not only realisation of unity in the Self, but of unity in the infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> of activities, worlds and creatures.\n\nTherefore, also, an integral liberation. Not only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> born of unbroken contact and identification of the individual being in all its parts with the Divine, *sāyujya-mukti*, by which it can become free[^2] even in its separation, even in the duality; not only the *sālokya-mukti* by which the whole conscious existence dwells in the same status of being as the Divine, in the state of Sachchidananda; but also the acquisition of the divine nature by the transformation of this lower being into the human image of the Divine, *sādharmya-mukti*, and the complete and final release of all, the liberation of the consciousness from the transitory mould of the ego and its unification with the One Being, universal both in the world and the individual and transcendentally one both in the world and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> all universe.\n\n[^2]: As the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jivanmukta</span>, who is entirely free even without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bodily life</span> in a final Samadhi.\n\nBy this integral realisation and liberation, the perfect harmony of the results of Knowledge, Love and Works. For there is attained the complete release from ego and identification in being with the One in all and beyond all. But since the attaining consciousness is not limited by its attainment, we win also the unity in Beatitude and the harmonised diversity in Love, so that all relations of the play remain possible to us even while we retain on the heights of our being the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with the Beloved. And by a similar wideness, being capable of a freedom in spirit that embraces life and does not depend upon withdrawal from life, we are able to become without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span>, bondage or reaction the channel in our mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span> poured out freely upon the world.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span> is of the nature not only of freedom, but of purity, beatitude and perfection. An integral purity which shall enable on the one hand the perfect reflection of the divine Being in ourselves and on the other the perfect outpouring of its Truth and Law in us in the terms of life and through the right<span class='page-number' id='s-48' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.48]</span> functioning of the complex instrument we are in our outer parts, is the condition of an integral liberty. Its result is an integral beatitude, in which there becomes possible at once the Ananda of all that is in the world seen as symbols of the Divine and the Ananda of that which is not-world. And it prepares the integral perfection of our humanity as a type of the Divine in the conditions of the human manifestation, a perfection founded on a certain free universality of being, of love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>, of play of knowledge and of play of will in power and will in unegoistic action. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span> also can be attained by the integral Yoga.\n\nPerfection includes perfection of mind and body, so that the highest results of Rajayoga and Hathayoga should be contained in the widest formula of the synthesis finally to be effected by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>. At any rate a full development of the general mental and physical faculties and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> attainable by humanity through Yoga must be included in the scope of the integral ^ method. Nor would these have any *raison d'être* unless employed for an integral mental and physical life. Such a mental and physical life would be in its nature a translation of the spiritual existence into its right mental and physical values. Thus we would arrive at a synthesis of the three degrees of Nature and of the three modes of human existence which she has evolved or is evolving. We would include in the scope of our liberated being and perfected modes of activity the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material life</span>, our base, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span>, our intermediate instrument.\n\nNor would the integrality to which we aspire be real or even possible, if it were confined to the individual. Since our divine perfection embraces the realisation of ourselves in being, in life and in love through others as well as through ourselves, the extension of our liberty and of its results in others would be the inevitable outcome as well as the broadest utility of our liberation and perfection. And the constant and inherent attempt of such an extension would be towards its increasing and ultimately complete generalisation in mankind.\n\nThe divinising of the normal material life of man and of his great secular attempt of mental and moral self-culture in the individual and the race by this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integralisation</span> of a widely perfect<span class='page-number' id='s-49' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.49]</span> spiritual existence would thus be the crown alike of our individual and of our common effort. Such a consummation being no other than the kingdom of heaven within reproduced in the kingdom of heaven without, would be also the true fulfilment of the great dream cherished in different terms by the world's religions.\n\nThe widest synthesis of perfection possible to thought is the sole effort entirely worthy of those whose dedicated vision perceives that God dwells concealed in humanity.<span class='page-number' id='s-50' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.50]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-systems","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Conditions of the Synthesis"}],"nxtt":"The Four Aids","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-four-aids","prvt":"The Systems of Yoga","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-systems-of-yoga","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-four-aids"],"t":"The Four Aids","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Yoga-Siddhi, the perfection that comes from the practice of Yoga, can be best attained by the combined working of four great instruments.

The lotus of the eternal knowledge and the eternal perfection is a bud closed and folded up within us. It opens swiftly or gradually, petal by petal, through successive realisations, once the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> begins to turn towards the Eternal, once his heart, no longer compressed and confined by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to finite appearances, becomes enamoured, in whatever degree, of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, all thought, all energising of the faculties, all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> passive or active, become thenceforward so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> shocks which disintegrate the teguments of the soul and remove the obstacles to the inevitable efflorescence. He who chooses the Infinite has been chosen by the Infinite.

So also all perfection of which the outer man is capable, is only a realising of the eternal perfection of the Spirit within him. We know the Divine and become the Divine, because we are That already in our secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. All teaching is a revealing, all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> is an unfolding. Self-attainment is the secret; self-knowledge and an increasing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> are the means and the process.\n\nThe usual agency of this revealing is the Word, the thing heard (*śruta*). The Word may come to us from within; it may come to us from without. But in either case, it is only an agency for setting the hidden knowledge to work. The word within may be the utterance of the inmost soul in us which is always open to the Divine; or it may be the word of the secret and universal Teacher who is seated in the hearts of all. There are rare cases in which none other is needed, for all the rest of the Yoga is an unfolding under that constant touch and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>; the lotus of the knowledge discloses itself from within by the power of irradiating effulgence which proceeds from the Dweller in the lotus of the heart. Great indeed, but few are those to whom self-knowledge from within is thus sufficient and who do not need to pass under the dominant influence of a written book or a living teacher.\n\nOrdinarily, the Word from without, representative of the Divine, is needed as an aid in the work of self-unfolding; and it may be either a word from the past or the more powerful word of the living Guru. In some cases this representative word is only taken as a sort of excuse for the inner power to awaken and manifest; it is, as it were, a concession of the omnipotent and omniscient Divine to the generality of a law that governs Nature. Thus it is said in the Upanishads of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span>, son of Devaki, that he received a word of the Rishi Ghora and had the knowledge. So Ramakrishna, having attained by his own internal effort the central illumination, accepted several teachers in the different paths of Yoga, but always showed in the manner and swiftness<span class='page-number' id='s-54' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.54]</span> of his realisation that this acceptance was a concession to the general rule by which effective knowledge must be received as by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disciple</span> from a Guru.\n\nBut usually the representative influence occupies a much larger place in the life of the sadhaka. If the Yoga is guided by a received written Shastra,—some Word from the past which embodies the experience of former Yogins,—it may be practised either by personal effort alone or with the aid of a Guru. The spiritual knowledge is then gained through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> on the truths that are taught and it is made living and conscious by their realisation in the personal experience; the Yoga proceeds by the results of prescribed methods taught in a Scripture or a tradition and reinforced and illumined by the instructions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span>. This is a narrower practice, but safe and effective within its limits, because it follows a well-beaten track to a long familiar <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>.\n\nFor the sadhaka of the integral Yoga it is necessary to remember that no written Shastra, however great its authority or however large its spirit, can be more than a partial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the eternal Knowledge. He will use, but never bind himself even by the greatest Scripture. Where the Scripture is profound, wide, catholic, it may exercise upon him an influence for the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and of incalculable importance. It may be associated in his experience with his awakening to crowning verities and his realisation of the highest experiences. His Yoga may be governed for a long time by one Scripture or by several successively,—if it is in the line of the great Hindu tradition, by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, for example, the Upanishads, the Veda. Or it may be a good part of his development to include in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> a richly varied experience of the truths of many Scriptures and make the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> opulent with all that is best in the past. But in the end he must take his station, or better still, if he can, always and from the beginning he must live in his own soul <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the limitations of the word that he uses. The Gita itself thus declares that the Yogin in his progress must pass beyond the written Truth,—*śabdabrahmātivartate*—beyond all that he has heard and all that he has yet to hear,—*śrotavyasya śrutasya ca*. For he is not<span class='page-number' id='s-55' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.55]</span> the sadhaka of a book or of many books; he is a sadhaka of the Infinite.\n\nAnother kind of Shastra is not Scripture, but a statement of the science and methods, the effective principles and way of working of the path of Yoga which the sadhaka elects to follow. Each path has its Shastra, either written or traditional, passing from mouth to mouth through a long line of Teachers. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> a great authority, a high reverence even is ordinarily attached to the written or traditional teaching. All the lines of the Yoga are supposed to be fixed and the Teacher who has received the Shastra by tradition and realised it in practice guides the disciple along the immemorial tracks. One often even hears the objection urged against a new practice, a new Yogic teaching, the adoption of a new formula, \"It is not according to the Shastra.\" But neither in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> nor in the actual practice of the Yogins is there really any such entire rigidity of an iron door shut against new truth, fresh revelation, widened experience. The written or traditional teaching expresses the knowledge and experiences of many centuries systematised, organised, made attainable to the beginner. Its importance and utility are therefore immense. But a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of variation and development is always practicable. Even so highly scientific a system as Rajayoga can be practised on other lines than the organised method of Patanjali. Each of the three paths of the *trimārga*[^1] breaks into many bypaths which meet again at the goal. The general knowledge on which the Yoga depends is fixed, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, the succession, the devices, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> must be allowed to vary; for the needs and particular impulsions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> nature have to be satisfied even while the general truths remain firm and constant.\n\n[^1]: The triple path of Knowledge, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span> and Works.\n\nAn integral and synthetic Yoga needs especially not to be bound by any written or traditional Shastra; for while it embraces the knowledge received from the past, it seeks to organise it anew for the present and the future. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> liberty of experience and of the restatement of knowledge in new terms and new combinations is the condition of its self-formation.<span class='page-number' id='s-56' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.56]</span> Seeking to embrace all life in itself, it is in the position not of a pilgrim following the highroad to his destination, but, to that extent at least, of a path-finder hewing his way through a virgin forest. For Yoga has long diverged from life and the ancient systems which sought to embrace it, such as those of our Vedic forefathers, are far away from us, expressed in terms which are no longer accessible, thrown into forms which are no longer applicable. Since then <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> has moved forward on the current of eternal Time and the same problem has to be approached from a new starting-point.\n\nBy this Yoga we not only seek the Infinite, but we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> upon the Infinite to unfold himself in human life. Therefore the Shastra of our Yoga must provide for an infinite liberty in the receptive human soul. A free adaptability in the manner and the type of the individual's acceptance of the Universal and Transcendent into himself is the right condition for the full spiritual life in man. Vivekananda, pointing out that the unity of all religions must necessarily express itself by an increasing richness of variety in its forms, said once that the perfect state of that essential unity would come when each man had his own religion, when not bound by sect or traditional form he followed the free self-adaptation of his nature in its relations with the Supreme. So also one may say that the perfection of the integral Yoga will come when each man is able to follow his own path of Yoga, pursuing the development of his own nature in its upsurging towards that which transcends the nature. For freedom is the final law and the last consummation.\n\nMeanwhile certain general lines have to be formed which may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> the thought and practice of the sadhaka. But these must take as much as possible the form of general truths, general statements of principle, the most powerful broad directions of effort and development rather than a fixed system which has to be followed as a routine. All Shastra is the outcome of past experience and a help to future experience. It is an aid and a partial guide. It puts up signposts, gives the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> of the main roads and the already explored directions, so that the traveller may know whither and by what paths he is proceeding.<span class='page-number' id='s-57' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.57]</span> The rest depends on personal effort and experience and upon the power of the Guide.\n\n---\n\nThe development of the experience in its rapidity, its amplitude, the intensity and power of its results, depends primarily, in the beginning of the path and long after, on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and personal effort of the sadhaka. The process of Yoga is a turning of the human soul from the egoistic state of consciousness absorbed in the outward appearances and attractions of things to a higher state in which the Transcendent and Universal can pour itself into the individual mould and transform it. The first determining element of the siddhi is, therefore, the intensity of the turning, the force which directs the soul inward. The power of aspiration of the heart, the force of the will, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of the mind, the perseverance and determination of the applied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> are the measure of that intensity. The ideal sadhaka should be able to say in the Biblical phrase, \"My zeal for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> has eaten me up.\" It is this zeal for the Lord,—*utsāha*, the zeal of the whole nature for its divine results, *vyākulatā*, the heart's eagerness for the attainment of the Divine,—that devours the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> and breaks up the limitations of its petty and narrow mould for the full and wide reception of that which it seeks, that which, being universal, exceeds and, being transcendent, surpasses even the largest and highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span> and nature.\n\nBut this is only one side of the force that works for perfection. The process of the integral Yoga has three stages, not indeed sharply distinguished or separate, but in a certain measure successive. There must be, first, the effort towards at least an initial and enabling self-transcendence and contact with the Divine; next, the reception of that which transcends, that with which we have gained communion, into ourselves for the transformation of our whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>; last, the utilisation of our transformed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> as a divine centre in the world. So long as the contact with the Divine is not in some considerable degree established, so long as there is not some measure of sustained<span class='page-number' id='s-58' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.58]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>, *sāyujya*, the element of personal effort must normally predominate. But in proportion as this contact establishes itself, the sadhaka must become conscious that a force other than his own, a force transcending his egoistic endeavour and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, is at work in him and to this Power he learns progressively to submit himself and delivers up to it the charge of his Yoga. In the end his own will and force become one with the higher Power; he merges them in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> and its transcendent and universal Force. He finds it thenceforward presiding over the necessary transformation of his mental, vital and physical being with an impartial wisdom and provident effectivity of which the eager and interested ego is not capable. It is when this identification and this self-merging are complete that the divine centre in the world is ready. Purified, liberated, plastic, illumined, it can begin to serve as a means for the direct action of a supreme Power in the larger Yoga of humanity or superhumanity, of the earth's spiritual progression or its transformation.\n\nAlways indeed it is the higher Power that acts. Our sense of personal effort and aspiration comes from the attempt of the egoistic mind to identify itself in a wrong and imperfect way with the workings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Force</span>. It persists in applying to experience on a supernormal plane the ordinary terms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> which it applies to its normal experiences in the world. In the world we act with the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span>; we claim the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> that work in us as our own; we claim as the effect of our personal will, wisdom, force, virtue the selective, formative, progressive action of the Transcendent in this frame of mind, life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. Enlightenment brings to us the knowledge that the ego is only an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>; we begin to perceive and feel that these things are our own in the sense that they belong to our supreme and integral Self, one with the Transcendent, not to the instrumental ego. Our limitations and distortions are our contribution to the working; the true power in it is the Divine's. When the human ego realises that its will is a tool, its wisdom <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and childishness, its power an infant's groping, its virtue a pretentious impurity, and learns to trust itself to that which transcends it, that is its salvation. The<span class='page-number' id='s-59' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.59]</span> apparent freedom and self-assertion of our personal being to which we are so profoundly attached, conceal a most pitiable subjection to a thousand suggestions, impulsions, forces which we have made extraneous to our little person. Our ego, boasting of freedom, is at every moment the slave, toy and puppet of countless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, powers, forces, influences in universal Nature. The self-abnegation of the ego in the Divine is its self-fulfilment; its surrender to that which transcends it is its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> from bonds and limits and its perfect freedom.\n\nBut still, in the practical development, each of the three stages has its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> and utility and must be given its time or its place. It will not do, it cannot be safe or effective to begin with the last and highest alone. It would not be the right course, either, to leap prematurely from one to another. For even if from the beginning we recognise in mind and heart the Supreme, there are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the nature which long prevent the recognition from becoming realisation. But without realisation our mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> cannot become a dynamic reality; it is still only a figure of knowledge, not a living truth, an idea, not yet a power. And even if realisation has begun, it may be dangerous to imagine or to assume too soon that we are altogether in the hands of the Supreme or are acting as his instrument. That assumption may introduce a calamitous falsity; it may produce a helpless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> or, magnifying the movements of the ego with the Divine Name, it may disastrously distort and ruin the whole course of the Yoga. There is a period, more or less prolonged, of internal effort and struggle in which the individual will has to reject the darkness and distortions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> and to put itself resolutely or vehemently on the side of the divine Light. The mental energies, the heart's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, the vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, the very physical being have to be compelled into the right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> or trained to admit and answer to the right influences. It is only then, only when this has been truly done, that the surrender of the lower to the higher can be effected, because the sacrifice has become acceptable.\n\nThe personal will of the sadhaka has first to seize on the egoistic energies and turn them towards the light and the right;<span class='page-number' id='s-60' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.60]</span> once turned, he has still to train them to recognise that always, always to accept, always to follow that. Progressing, he learns, still using the personal will, personal effort, personal energies, to employ them as representatives of the higher Power and in conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to the higher Influence. Progressing yet farther, his will, effort, energy become no longer personal and separate, but activities of that higher Power and Influence at work in the individual. But there is still a sort of gulf or distance which necessitates an obscure process of transit, not always accurate, sometimes even very distorting, between the divine Origin and the emerging human current. At the end of the process, with the progressive disappearance of egoism and impurity and ignorance, this last separation is removed; all in the individual becomes the divine working.\n\n---\n\nAs the supreme Shastra of the integral Yoga is the eternal Veda secret in the heart of every man, so its supreme Guide and Teacher is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner Guide</span>, the World-Teacher, *jagad-guru*, secret within us. It is he who destroys our darkness by the resplendent light of his knowledge; that light becomes within us the increasing glory of his own self-revelation. He discloses progressively in us his own nature of freedom, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, power, immortal being. He sets above us his divine example as our ideal and transforms the lower existence into a reflection of that which it contemplates. By the inpouring of his own influence and presence into us he enables the individual being to attain to identity with the universal and transcendent.\n\nWhat is his method and his system? He has no method and every method. His system is a natural organisation of the highest processes and movements of which the nature is capable. Applying themselves even to the pettiest details and to the actions the most insignificant in their appearance with as much care and thoroughness as to the greatest, they in the end lift all into the Light and transform all. For in his Yoga there is nothing too small to be used and nothing too great to be attempted. As the<span class='page-number' id='s-61' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.61]</span> servant and disciple of the Master has no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> with pride or egoism because all is done for him from above, so also he has no right to despond because of his personal deficiencies or the stumblings of his nature. For the Force that works in him is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>—or superpersonal—and infinite.\n\nThe full recognition of this inner Guide, Master of the Yoga, lord, light, enjoyer and goal of all sacrifice and effort, is of the utmost importance in the path of integral perfection. It is immaterial whether he is first seen as an impersonal Wisdom, Love and Power behind all things, as an Absolute manifesting in the relative and attracting it, as one's highest Self and the highest Self of all, as a Divine Person within us and in the world, in one of his—or her—numerous forms and names or as the ideal which the mind conceives. In the end we perceive that he is all and more than all these things together. The mind's door of entry to the conception of him must necessarily vary according to the past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> and the present nature.\n\nThis inner Guide is often veiled at first by the very intensity of our personal effort and by the ego's preoccupation with itself and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>. As we gain in clarity and the turmoil of egoistic effort gives place to a calmer self-knowledge, we recognise the source of the growing light within us. We recognise it retrospectively as we realise how all our obscure and conflicting movements have been determined towards an end that we only now begin to perceive, how even before our entrance into the path of the Yoga the evolution of our life has been designedly led towards its turning-point. For now we begin to understand the sense of our struggles and efforts, successes and failures. At last we are able to seize the meaning of our ordeals and sufferings and can appreciate the help that was given us by all that hurt and resisted and the utility of our very falls and stumblings. We recognise this divine leading afterwards, not retrospectively but immediately, in the moulding of our thoughts by a transcendent Seer, of our will and actions by an all-embracing Power, of our emotional life by an all-attracting and all-assimilating Bliss and Love. We recognise it too in a more personal relation that from the first touched or at the last seizes us; we feel the<span class='page-number' id='s-62' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.62]</span> eternal presence of a supreme Master, Friend, Lover, Teacher. We recognise it in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of our being as that develops into likeness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with a greater and wider existence; for we perceive that this miraculous development is not the result of our own efforts: an eternal Perfection is moulding us into its own image. One who is the Lord or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> of the Yogic philosophies, the Guide in the conscious being (*caitya guru* or *antaryāmin*), the Absolute of the thinker, the Unknowable of the Agnostic, the universal Force of the materialist, the supreme Soul and the supreme Shakti, the One who is differently named and imaged by the religions, is the Master of our Yoga.\n\nTo see, know, become and fulfil this One in our inner selves and in all our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer nature</span>, was always the secret goal and becomes now the conscious purpose of our embodied existence. To be conscious of him in all parts of our being and equally in all that the dividing mind sees as outside our being, is the consummation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual consciousness</span>. To be possessed by him and possess him in ourselves and in all things is the term of all empire and mastery. To enjoy him in all experience of passivity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, of peace and of power, of unity and of difference is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span>, the individual soul manifested in the world, is obscurely seeking. This is the entire definition of the aim of integral Yoga; it is the rendering in personal experience of the truth which universal Nature has hidden in herself and which she travails to discover. It is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> of the human soul into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine soul</span> and of natural life into divine living.\n\n---\n\nThe surest way towards this integral fulfilment is to find the Master of the secret who dwells within us, open ourselves constantly to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> which is also the divine Wisdom and Love and trust to it to effect the conversion. But it is difficult for the egoistic consciousness to do this at all at the beginning. And, if done at all, it is still difficult to do it perfectly and in every strand of our nature. It is difficult at first because our<span class='page-number' id='s-63' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.63]</span> egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of thought, of sensation, of feeling block up the avenues by which we can arrive at the perception that is needed. It is difficult afterwards because the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, the surrender, the courage requisite in this path are not easy to the ego-clouded soul. The divine working is not the working which the egoistic mind desires or approves; for it uses error in order to arrive at truth, suffering in order to arrive at bliss, imperfection in order to arrive at perfection. The ego cannot see where it is being led; it revolts against the leading, loses confidence, loses courage. These failings would not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>; for the divine Guide within is not offended by our revolt, not discouraged by our want of faith or repelled by our weakness; he has the entire love of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the mother</span> and the entire patience of the teacher. But by withdrawing our assent from the guidance we lose the consciousness, though not all the actuality—not, in any case, the eventuality—of its benefit. And we withdraw our assent because we fail to distinguish our higher Self from the lower through which he is preparing his self-revelation. As in the world, so in ourselves, we cannot see <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> because of his workings and, especially, because he works in us through our nature and not by a succession of arbitrary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span>. Man demands miracles that he may have faith; he wishes to be dazzled in order that he may see. And this impatience, this ignorance may turn into a great danger and disaster if, in our revolt against the divine leading, we call in another distorting Force more satisfying to our impulses and desires and ask it to guide us and give it the Divine Name.\n\nBut while it is difficult for man to believe in something unseen within himself, it is easy for him to believe in something which he can image as extraneous to himself. The spiritual progress of most human beings demands an extraneous support, an object of faith outside us. It needs an external image of God; or it needs a human representative,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Incarnation</span>, Prophet or Guru; or it demands both and receives them. For according to the need of the human soul the Divine manifests himself as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>deity</span>, as human divine or in simple humanity—using that thick disguise, which so successfully conceals the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span>, for a means of transmission of his guidance.<span class='page-number' id='s-64' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.64]</span>\n\nThe Hindu <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of spirituality provides for this need of the soul by the conceptions of the Ishta Devata, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Avatar</span> and the Guru. By the Ishta Devata, the chosen deity, is meant,—not some inferior Power, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span> of the transcendent and universal Godhead. Almost all religions either have as their base or make use of some such name and form of the Divine. Its necessity for the human soul is evident. God is the All and more than the All. But that which is more than the All, how shall man conceive? And even the All is at first too hard for him; for he himself in his active consciousness is a limited and selective formation and can open himself only to that which is in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with his limited nature. There are things in the All which are too hard for his comprehension or seem too terrible to his sensitive emotions and cowering sensations. Or, simply, he cannot conceive as the Divine, cannot approach or cannot recognise something that is too much out of the circle of his ignorant or partial conceptions. It is necessary for him to conceive God in his own image or in some form that is beyond himself but consonant with his highest tendencies and seizable by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> or his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. Otherwise it would be difficult for him to come into contact and communion with the Divine.\n\nEven then his nature calls for a human intermediary so that he may feel the Divine in something entirely close to his own humanity and sensible in a human influence and example. This call is satisfied by the Divine manifest in a human appearance, the Incarnation, the Avatar—Krishna, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span>. Or if this is too hard for him to conceive, the Divine represents himself through a less marvellous intermediary,—Prophet or Teacher. For many who cannot conceive or are unwilling to accept the Divine Man, are ready to open themselves to the supreme man, terming him not incarnation but world-teacher or divine representative.\n\nThis also is not enough; a living influence, a living example, a present instruction is needed. For it is only the few who can make the past Teacher and his teaching, the past Incarnation and his example and influence a living force in their lives. For this need<span class='page-number' id='s-65' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.65]</span> also the Hindu discipline provides in the relation of the Guru and the disciple. The Guru may sometimes be the Incarnation or World-Teacher; but it is sufficient that he should represent to the disciple the divine wisdom, convey to him something of the divine ideal or make him feel the realised relation of the human soul with the Eternal.\n\nThe sadhaka of the integral Yoga will make use of all these aids according to his nature; but it is necessary that he should shun their limitations and cast from himself that exclusive tendency of egoistic mind which cries, \"My God, my Incarnation, my Prophet, my Guru,\" and opposes it to all other realisation in a sectarian or a fanatical spirit. All sectarianism, all fanaticism must be shunned; for it is inconsistent with the integrity of the divine realisation.\n\nOn the contrary, the sadhaka of the integral Yoga will not be satisfied until he has included all other names and forms of Deity in his own conception, seen his own Ishta Devata in all others, unified all Avatars in the unity of Him who descends in the Avatar, welded the truth in all teachings into the harmony of the Eternal Wisdom.\n\nNor should he forget the aim of these external aids which is to awaken his soul to the Divine within him. Nothing has been finally accomplished if that has not been accomplished. It is not sufficient to worship Krishna, Christ or Buddha without, if there is not the revealing and the formation of the Buddha, the Christ or Krishna in ourselves. And all other aids equally have no other purpose; each is a bridge between man's unconverted state and the revelation of the Divine within him.\n\n---\n\nThe Teacher of the integral Yoga will follow as far as he may the method of the Teacher within us. He will lead the disciple through the nature of the disciple. Teaching, example, influence,—these are the three instruments of the Guru. But the wise Teacher will not seek to impose himself or his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> on the passive acceptance of the receptive mind; he will throw in only<span class='page-number' id='s-66' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.66]</span> what is productive and sure as a seed which will grow under the divine fostering within. He will seek to awaken much more than to instruct; he will aim at the growth of the faculties and the experiences by a natural process and free expansion. He will give a method as an aid, as a utilisable device, not as an imperative formula or a fixed routine. And he will be on his guard against any turning of the means into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>, against the mechanising of process. His whole business is to awaken the divine light and set working the divine force of which he himself is only a means and an aid, a body or a channel.\n\nThe example is more powerful than the instruction; but it is not the example of the outward acts nor that of the personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> which is of most importance. These have their place and their utility; but what will most stimulate aspiration in others is the central fact of the divine realisation within him governing his whole life and inner state and all his activities. This is the universal and essential element; the rest belongs to individual person and circumstance. It is this dynamic realisation that the sadhaka must feel and reproduce in himself according to his own nature; he need not strive after an imitation from outside which may well be sterilising rather than productive of right and natural fruits.\n\nInfluence is more important than example. Influence is not the outward authority of the Teacher over his disciple, but the power of his contact, of his presence, of the nearness of his soul to the soul of another, infusing into it, even though in silence, that which he himself is and possesses. This is the supreme sign of the Master. For the greatest Master is much less a Teacher than a Presence pouring the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> and its constituting light and power and purity and bliss into all who are receptive around him.\n\nAnd it shall also be a sign of the teacher of the integral Yoga that he does not arrogate to himself Guruhood in a humanly vain and self-exalting spirit. His work, if he has one, is a trust from above, he himself a channel, a vessel or a representative. He is a man helping his brothers, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> leading children, a Light kindling other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span>, an awakened Soul awakening souls,<span class='page-number' id='s-67' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.67]</span> at highest a Power or Presence of the Divine calling to him other powers of the Divine.\n\n---\n\nThe sadhaka who has all these aids is sure of his goal. Even a fall will be for him only a means of rising and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> a passage towards fulfilment. For once on this path, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> and death become only processes in the development of his being and the stages of his journey.\n\nTime is the remaining aid needed for the effectivity of the process. Time presents itself to human effort as an enemy or a friend, as a resistance, a medium or an instrument. But always it is really the instrument of the soul.\n\nTime is a field of circumstances and forces meeting and working out a resultant progression whose course it measures. To the ego it is a tyrant or a resistance, to the Divine an instrument. Therefore, while our effort is personal, Time appears as a resistance, for it presents to us all the obstruction of the forces that conflict with our own. When the divine working and the personal are combined in our consciousness, it appears as a medium and a condition. When the two become one, it appears as a servant and instrument.\n\nThe ideal attitude of the sadhaka towards Time is to have an endless patience as if he had all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span> for his fulfilment and yet to develop the energy that shall realise now and with an ever-increasing mastery and pressure of rapidity till it reaches the miraculous instantaneousness of the supreme divine Transformation.<span class='page-number' id='s-68' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.68]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-four-aids","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"Self-Consecration","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/self-consecration","prvt":"The Synthesis of the Systems","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-systems","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["self-consecration"],"t":"Self-Consecration","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> Yoga is in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>; it is a birth out of the ordinary, the mentalised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> into a higher spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and a greater and diviner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>.

The soul that is called to this deep and vast inward change, may arrive in different ways to the initial departure. It may come to it by its own natural development which has been leading it unconsciously towards the awakening; it may reach it through the influence of a religion or the attraction of a philosophy; it may approach it by a slow illumination or leap to it by a sudden touch or shock; it may be pushed or led to it by the pressure of outward circumstances or by an inward necessity, by a single word that breaks the seals of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> or by long reflection, by the distant example of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> who has trod the path or by contact and daily influence. According to the nature and the circumstances the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> will come.\n\nBut in whatever way it comes, there must be a decision of the mind and the will and, as its result, a complete and effective self-consecration. The acceptance of a new spiritual idea-force and upward orientation in the being, an illumination, a turning or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> seized on by the will and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>'s <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>,—this is the momentous act which contains as in a seed all the results that the Yoga has to give. The mere idea or intellectual seeking of something higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, however strongly grasped by the mind's interest, is ineffective unless it is seized on by the heart as the one thing desirable and by the will as the one thing to be done. For truth of the Spirit has not to be merely thought but to be lived, and to live it demands a unified single-mindedness of the being; so great a change as is contemplated by the Yoga is not to be effected by a divided will or by a small portion of the<span class='page-number' id='s-69' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.69]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> or by a hesitating mind. He who seeks the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> must consecrate himself to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and to God only.\n\nIf the change comes suddenly and decisively by an overpowering influence, there is no further essential or lasting difficulty. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> follows upon the thought, or is simultaneous with it, and the self-consecration follows upon the choice. The feet are already set upon the path, even if they seem at first to wander uncertainly and even though the path itself may be only obscurely seen and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> may be imperfect. The secret Teacher, the inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guide</span> is already at work, though he may not yet manifest himself or may not yet appear in the person of his human representative. Whatever <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> and hesitations may ensue, they cannot eventually prevail against the power of the experience that has turned the current of the life. The call, once decisive, stands; the thing that has been born cannot eventually be stifled. Even if the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of circumstances prevents a regular pursuit or a full practical self-consecration from the first, still the mind has taken its bent and persists and returns with an ever-increasing effect upon its leading preoccupation. There is an ineluctable persistence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span>, and against it circumstances are in the end powerless, and no weakness in the nature can for long be an obstacle.\n\nBut this is not always the manner of the commencement. The sadhaka is often led gradually and there is a long space between the first turning of the mind and the full assent of the nature to the thing towards which it turns. There may at first be only a vivid intellectual interest, a forcible attraction towards the idea and some imperfect form of practice. Or perhaps there is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> not favoured by the whole nature, a decision or a turn imposed by an intellectual influence or dictated by personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> and admiration for someone who is himself consecrated and devoted to the Highest. In such cases, a long period of preparation may be necessary before there comes the irrevocable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span>; and in some instances it may not come. There may be some advance, there may be a strong effort, even much purification and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> other than those that are central or supreme; but the life will either be spent in<span class='page-number' id='s-70' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.70]</span> preparation or, a certain stage having been reached, the mind pushed by an insufficient driving-force may rest content at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> of the effort possible to it. Or there may even be a recoil to the lower life,—what is called in the ordinary parlance of Yoga a fall from the path. This lapse happens because there is a defect at the very centre. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> has been interested, the heart attracted, the will has strung itself to the effort, but the whole nature has not been taken captive by the Divine. It has only acquiesced in the interest, the attraction or the endeavour. There has been an experiment, perhaps even an eager experiment, but not a total self-giving to an imperative need of the soul or to an unforsakable ideal. Even such imperfect Yoga has not been wasted; for no upward effort is made in vain. Even if it fails in the present or arrives only at some preparatory stage or preliminary realisation, it has yet determined the soul's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>.\n\nBut if we desire to make the most of the opportunity that this life gives us, if we wish to respond adequately to the call we have received and to attain to the goal we have glimpsed, not merely advance a little towards it, it is essential that there should be an entire self-giving. The secret of success in Yoga is to regard it not as one of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> to be pursued in life, but as the one and only aim, not as an important part of life, but as the whole of life.\n\n---\n\nAnd since Yoga is in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> a turning away from the ordinary material and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animal life</span> led by most men or from the more mental but still limited way of living followed by the few to a greater spiritual life, to the way divine, every part of our energies that is given to the lower existence in the spirit of that existence is a contradiction of our aim and our self-dedication. On the other hand, every energy or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> that we can convert from its allegiance to the lower and dedicate to the service of the higher is so much gained on our road, so much taken from the powers that oppose our progress. It is the difficulty of this wholesale conversion that is the source of all the stumblings in<span class='page-number' id='s-71' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.71]</span> the path of Yoga. For our entire nature and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, all our personal and all our universal self, are full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> and of influences that are opposed to our spiritual rebirth and work against the whole-heartedness of our endeavour. In a certain sense we are nothing but a complex mass of mental, nervous and physical habits held together by a few ruling ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span>,—an amalgam of many small self-repeating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> with a few major vibrations. What we propose in our Yoga is nothing less than to break up the whole formation of our past and present which makes up the ordinary material and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span> and to create a new centre of vision and a new universe of activities in ourselves which shall constitute a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> or a superhuman nature.\n\nThe first necessity is to dissolve that central <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and vision in the mind which concentrate it on its development and satisfaction and interests in the old externalised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of things. It is imperative to exchange this surface orientation for the deeper faith and vision which see only the Divine and seek only after the Divine. The next need is to compel all our lower being to pay homage to this new faith and greater vision. All our nature must make an integral surrender; it must offer itself in every part and every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> to that which seems to the unregenerated sense-mind so much less real than the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span> and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>. Our whole being—soul, mind, sense, heart, will, life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>—must consecrate all its energies so entirely and in such a way that it shall become a fit vehicle for the Divine. This is no easy task; for everything in the world follows the fixed habit which is to it a law and resists a radical change. And no change can be more radical than the revolution attempted in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>. Everything in us has constantly to be called back to the central faith and will and vision. Every thought and impulse has to be reminded in the language of the Upanishad that \"That is the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> and not this which men here adore.\" Every vital fibre has to be persuaded to accept an entire renunciation of all that hitherto represented to it its own existence. Mind has to cease to be mind and become brilliant with something beyond it. Life has to change into a thing vast and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and intense and<span class='page-number' id='s-72' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.72]</span> powerful that can no longer recognise its old blind eager narrow self of petty impulse and desire. Even the body has to submit to a mutation and be no longer the clamorous animal or the impeding clod it now is, but become instead a conscious servant and radiant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> and living form of the spirit.\n\nThe difficulty of the task has led naturally to the pursuit of easy and trenchant solutions; it has generated and fixed deeply the tendency of religions and of schools of Yoga to separate the life of the world from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span>. The powers of this world and their actual activities, it is felt, either do not belong to God at all or are for some obscure and puzzling cause, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span> or another, a dark contradiction of the divine Truth. And on their own opposite side the powers of the Truth and their ideal activities are seen to belong to quite another plane of consciousness than that, obscure, ignorant and perverse in its impulses and forces, on which the life of the earth is founded. There appears at once the antinomy of a bright and pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>kingdom of God</span> and a dark and impure kingdom of the devil; we feel the opposition of our crawling earthly birth and life to an exalted spiritual God-consciousness; we become readily convinced of the incompatibility of life's subjection to Maya with the soul's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> in pure Brahman existence. The easiest way is to turn away from all that belongs to the one and to retreat by a naked and precipitous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into the other. Thus arises the attraction and, it would seem, the necessity of the principle of exclusive concentration which plays so prominent a part in the specialised schools of Yoga; for by that concentration we can arrive through an uncompromising renunciation of the world at an entire self-consecration to the One on whom we concentrate. It is no longer incumbent on us to compel all the lower activities to the difficult recognition of a new and higher spiritualised life and train them to be its agents or executive powers. It is enough to kill or quiet them and keep at most the few energies necessary, on one side, for the maintenance of the body and, on the other, for communion with the Divine.\n\nThe very aim and conception of an integral Yoga debar us from adopting this simple and strenuous high-pitched process.<span class='page-number' id='s-73' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.73]</span> The hope of an integral transformation forbids us to take a short cut or to make ourselves light for the race by throwing away our impedimenta. For we have set out to conquer all ourselves and the world for God; we are determined to give him our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> as well as our being and not merely to bring the pure and naked spirit as a bare <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> to a remote and secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> in a distant heaven or abolish all we are in a holocaust to an immobile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span>. The Divine that we adore is not only a remote extra-cosmic Reality, but a half-veiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Manifestation</span> present and near to us here in the universe. Life is the field of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine manifestation</span> not yet complete: here, in life, on earth, in the body,—*ihaiva*, as the Upanishads insist,—we have to unveil the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span>; here we must make its transcendent greatness, light and sweetness real to our consciousness, here possess and, as far as may be, express it. Life then we must accept in our Yoga in order utterly to transmute it; we are forbidden to shrink from the difficulties that this acceptance may add to our struggle. Our compensation is that even if the path is more rugged, the effort more complex and bafflingly arduous, yet after a certain point we gain an immense advantage. For once our minds are reasonably fixed in the central vision and our wills are on the whole converted to the single pursuit, Life becomes our helper. Intent, vigilant, integrally conscious, we can take every detail of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and every incident of its movements as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> for the sacrificial Fire within us. Victorious in the struggle, we can compel Earth herself to be an aid towards our perfection and can enrich our realisation with the booty torn from the Powers that oppose us.\n\n---\n\nThere is another direction in which the ordinary practice of Yoga arrives at a helpful but narrowing simplification which is denied to the sadhaka of the integral aim. The practice of Yoga brings us face to face with the extraordinary complexity of our own being, the stimulating but also embarrassing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> of our personality, the rich endless confusion of Nature. To the ordinary man<span class='page-number' id='s-74' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.74]</span> who lives upon his own waking surface, ignorant of the self's depths and vastnesses behind the veil, his psychological existence is fairly simple. A small but clamorous company of desires, some imperative intellectual and aesthetic cravings, some tastes, a few ruling or prominent ideas amid a great current of unconnected or ill-connected and mostly trivial thoughts, a number of more or less imperative vital needs, alternations of physical health and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span>, a scattered and inconsequent succession of joys and griefs, frequent minor disturbances and vicissitudes and rarer strong searchings and upheavals of mind or body, and through it all Nature, partly with the aid of his thought and will, partly without or in spite of it, arranging these things in some rough practical fashion, some tolerable disorderly order,—this is the material of his existence. The average <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> even now is in his inward existence as crude and undeveloped as was the bygone primitive man in his outward life. But as soon as we go deep within ourselves,—and Yoga means a plunge into all the multiple profundities of the soul,—we find ourselves subjectively, as man in his growth has found himself objectively, surrounded by a whole complex world which we have to know and to conquer.\n\nThe most disconcerting discovery is to find that every part of us—intellect, will, sense-mind, nervous or desire self, the heart, the body—has each, as it were, its own complex <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> and natural formation independent of the rest; it neither agrees with itself nor with the others nor with the representative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> which is the shadow cast by some central and centralising self on our superficial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span>. We find that we are composed not of one but many personalities and each has its own demands and differing nature. Our being is a roughly constituted chaos into which we have to introduce the principle of a divine order. Moreover, we find that inwardly too, no less than outwardly, we are not alone in the world; the sharp separateness of our ego was no more than a strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imposition</span> and delusion; we do not exist in ourselves, we do not really live apart in an inner privacy or solitude. Our mind is a receiving, developing and modifying machine into which there is being constantly passed from<span class='page-number' id='s-75' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.75]</span> moment to moment a ceaseless foreign flux, a streaming mass of disparate materials from above, from below, from outside. Much more than half our thoughts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> are not our own in the sense that they take form out of ourselves; of hardly anything can it be said that it is truly original to our nature. A large part comes to us from others or from the environment, whether as raw material or as manufactured imports; but still more largely they come from universal Nature here or from other worlds and planes and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> and powers and influences; for we are overtopped and environed by other planes of consciousness, mind planes, life planes, subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> planes, from which our life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> here are fed, or fed on, pressed, dominated, made use of for the manifestation of their forms and forces. The difficulty of our separate salvation is immensely increased by this complexity and manifold openness and subjection to the in-streaming energies of the universe. Of all this we have to take account, to deal with it, to know what is the secret stuff of our nature and its constituent and resultant motions and to create in it all a divine centre and a true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and luminous order.\n\nIn the ordinary paths of Yoga the method used for dealing with these conflicting materials is direct and simple. One or another of the principal psychological forces in us is selected as our single means for attaining to the Divine; the rest is quieted into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> or left to starve in its smallness. The Bhakta, seizing on the emotional forces of the being, the intense activities of the heart, abides concentrated in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of God, gathered up as into a single one-pointed tongue of fire; he is indifferent to the activities of thought, throws behind him the importunities of the reason, cares nothing for the mind's thirst for knowledge. All the knowledge he needs is his faith and the inspirations that well up from a heart in communion with the Divine. He has no use for any will to works that is not turned to the direct worship of the Beloved or the service of the temple. The man of Knowledge, self-confined by a deliberate choice to the force and activities of discriminative thought, finds release in the mind's hushed inward-drawn endeavour. He concentrates on the idea of the self, succeeds by a subtle inner discernment<span class='page-number' id='s-76' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.76]</span> in distinguishing its silent presence amid the veiling activities of Nature, and through the perceptive idea arrives at the concrete spiritual experience. He is indifferent to the play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, deaf to the hunger-call of passion, closed to the activities of Life,—the more blessed he, the sooner they fall away from him and leave him free, still and mute, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> non-doer. The body is his stumbling-block, the vital functions are his enemies; if their demands can be reduced to a minimum, that is his great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span>. The endless difficulties that arise from the environing world are dismissed by erecting firmly against them a defence of outer physical and inner spiritual solitude; safe behind a wall of inner silence, he remains impassive and untouched by the world and by others. To be alone with oneself or alone with the Divine, to walk apart with God and his devotees, to entrench oneself in the single self-ward endeavour of the mind or Godward passion of the heart is the trend of these Yogas. The problem is solved by the excision of all but the one central difficulty which pursues the one chosen motive-force; into the midst of the dividing calls of our nature the principle of an exclusive concentration comes sovereignly to our rescue.\n\nBut for the sadhaka of the integral Yoga this inner or this outer solitude can only be incidents or periods in his spiritual progress. Accepting life, he has to bear not only his own burden, but a great part of the world's burden too along with it, as a continuation of his own sufficiently heavy load. Therefore his Yoga has much more of the nature of a battle than others; but this is not only an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> battle, it is a collective war waged over a considerable country. He has not only to conquer in himself the forces of egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> and disorder, but to conquer them as representatives of the same adverse and inexhaustible forces in the world. Their representative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> gives them a much more obstinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of resistance, an almost endless right to recurrence. Often he finds that even after he has won persistently his own personal battle, he has still to win it over and over again in a seemingly interminable war, because his inner existence has already been so much enlarged that not only it contains his own being with its well-defined needs and experiences, but is in<span class='page-number' id='s-77' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.77]</span> solidarity with the being of others, because in himself he contains the universe.\n\nNor is the seeker of the integral fulfilment permitted to solve too arbitrarily even the conflict of his own inner members. He has to harmonise deliberate knowledge with unquestioning faith; he must conciliate the gentle soul of love with the formidable need of power; the passivity of the soul that lives content in transcendent calm has to be fused with the activity of the divine helper and the divine warrior. To him as to all seekers of the spirit there are offered for solution the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oppositions</span> of the reason, the clinging hold of the senses, the perturbations of the heart, the ambush of the desires, the clog of the physical body; but he has to deal in another fashion with their mutual and internal conflicts and their hindrance to his aim, for he must arrive at an infinitely more difficult perfection in the handling of all this rebel matter. Accepting them as instruments for the divine realisation and manifestation, he has to convert their jangling discords, to enlighten their thick darknesses, to transfigure them separately and all together, harmonising them in themselves and with each other,—integrally, omitting no grain or strand or vibration, leaving no iota of imperfection anywhere. An exclusive concentration, or even a succession of concentrations of that kind, can be in his complex work only a temporary convenience; it has to be abandoned as soon as its utility is over. An all-inclusive concentration is the difficult achievement towards which he must <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span>.\n\n---\n\nConcentration is indeed the first condition of any Yoga, but it is an all-receiving concentration that is the very nature of the integral Yoga. A separate strong fixing of the thought, of the emotions or of the will on a single idea, object, state, inner movement or principle is no doubt a frequent need here also; but this is only a subsidiary helpful process. A wide massive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span>, a harmonised concentration of the whole being in all its parts and through all its powers upon the One who is the All<span class='page-number' id='s-78' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.78]</span> is the larger action of this Yoga without which it cannot achieve its purpose. For it is the consciousness that rests in the One and that acts in the All to which we aspire; it is this that we seek to impose on every element of our being and on every movement of our nature. This wide and concentrated totality is the essential character of the Sadhana and its character must determine its practice.\n\nBut even though the concentration of all the being on the Divine is the character of the Yoga, yet is our being too complex a thing to be taken up easily and at once, as if we were taking up the world in a pair of hands, and set in its entirety to a single task. Man in his effort at self-transcendence has usually to seize on some one spring or some powerful leverage in the complicated machine that his nature is; this spring or lever he touches in preference to others and uses it to set the machine in motion towards the end that he has in view. In his choice it is always Nature itself that should be his guide. But here it must be Nature at her highest and widest in him, not at her lowest or in some limiting movement. In her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower vital</span> activities it is desire that Nature takes as her most powerful leverage; but the distinct character of man is that he is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>, not a merely vital creature. As he can use his thinking mind and will to restrain and correct his life impulses, so too he can bring in the action of a still higher luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> aided by the deeper soul in him, the psychic being, and supersede by these greater and purer motive-powers the domination of the vital and sensational force that we call desire. He can entirely <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> or persuade it and offer it up for transformation to its divine Master. This higher mentality and this deeper soul, the psychic element in man, are the two grappling hooks by which the Divine can lay hold upon his nature.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher mind</span> in man is something other, loftier, purer, vaster, more powerful than the reason or logical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. The animal is a vital and sensational being; man, it is said, is distinguished from the animal by the possession of reason. But that is a very summary, a very imperfect and misleading account of the matter. For reason is only a particular and limited<span class='page-number' id='s-79' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.79]</span> utilitarian and instrumental activity that proceeds from something much greater than itself, from a power that dwells in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> more luminous, wider, illimitable. The true and ultimate, as distinguished from the immediate or intermediate importance of our observing, reasoning, inquiring, judging intelligence is that it prepares the human being for the right reception and right action of a Light from above which must progressively replace in him the obscure light from below that guides the animal. The latter also has a rudimentary reason, a kind of thought, a soul, a will and keen emotions; even though less developed, its psychology is yet the same in kind as man's. But all these capacities in the animal are automatically moved and strictly limited, almost even constituted by the lower nervous being. All animal perceptions, sensibilities, activities are ruled by nervous and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, cravings, needs, satisfactions, of which the nexus is the life-impulse and vital desire. Man too is bound, but less bound, to this automatism of the vital nature. Man can bring an enlightened will, an enlightened thought and enlightened emotions to the difficult work of his self-development; he can more and more subject to these more conscious and reflecting guides the inferior function of desire. In proportion as he can thus master and enlighten his lower self, he is man and no longer an animal. When he can begin to replace desire altogether by a still greater enlightened thought and sight and will in touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, consciously subject to a diviner will than his own, linked to a more universal and transcendent knowledge, he has commenced the ascent towards the superman; he is on his upward march towards the Divine.\n\nIt is, then, in the highest mind of thought and light and will or it is in the inner heart of deepest feeling and emotion that we must first centre our consciousness,—in either of them or, if we are capable, in both together,—and use that as our leverage to lift the nature wholly towards the Divine. The concentration of an enlightened thought, will and heart turned in unison towards one vast goal of our knowledge, one luminous and infinite source of our action, one imperishable object of our emotion is the starting-point of the Yoga. And the object of our seeking must be<span class='page-number' id='s-80' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.80]</span> the very fount of the Light which is growing in us, the very origin of the Force which we are calling to move our members. Our one objective must be the Divine himself to whom, knowingly or unknowingly, something always aspires in our secret nature. There must be a large, many-sided yet single concentration of the thought on the idea, the perception, the vision, the awakening touch, the soul's realisation of the one Divine. There must be a flaming concentration of the heart on the seeking of the All and Eternal and, when once we have found him, a deep plunging and immersion in the possession and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of the All-Beautiful. There must be a strong and immovable concentration of the will on the attainment and fulfilment of all that the Divine is and a free and plastic opening of it to all that he intends to manifest in us. This is the triple way of the Yoga.\n\n---\n\nBut on that which as yet we know not how shall we concentrate? And yet we cannot know the Divine unless we have achieved this concentration of our being upon him. A concentration which culminates in a living realisation and the constant sense of the presence of the One in ourselves and in all of which we are aware, is what we mean in Yoga by knowledge and the effort after knowledge. It is not enough to devote ourselves by the reading of Scriptures or by the stress of philosophic reasoning to an intellectual understanding of the Divine; for at the end of our long mental labour we might know all that has been said of the Eternal, possess all that can be thought about the Infinite and yet we might not know him at all. This intellectual preparation can indeed be the first stage in a powerful Yoga, but it is not indispensable: it is not a step which all need or can be called upon to take. Yoga would be impossible, except for a very few, if the intellectual figure of knowledge arrived at by the speculative or meditative Reason were its indispensable condition or a binding preliminary. All that the Light from above asks of us that it may begin its work is a call from the soul and a sufficient point of support in the mind. This support can be reached through an<span class='page-number' id='s-81' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.81]</span> insistent idea of the Divine in the thought, a corresponding will in the dynamic parts, an aspiration, a faith, a need in the heart. Any one of these may lead or predominate, if all cannot move in unison or in an equal rhythm. The idea may be and must in the beginning be inadequate; the aspiration may be narrow and imperfect, the faith poorly illumined or even, as not surely founded on the rock of knowledge, fluctuating, uncertain, easily diminished; often even it may be extinguished and need to be lit again with difficulty like a torch in a windy pass. But if once there is a resolute self-consecration from deep within, if there is an awakening to the soul's call, these inadequate things can be a sufficient instrument for the divine purpose. Therefore the wise have always been unwilling to limit man's avenues towards God; they would not shut against his entry even the narrowest portal, the lowest and darkest postern, the humblest wicket-gate. Any name, any form, any symbol, any offering has been held to be sufficient if there is the consecration along with it; for the Divine knows himself in the heart of the seeker and accepts the sacrifice.\n\nBut still the greater and wider the moving idea-force behind the consecration, the better for the seeker; his attainment is likely to be fuller and more ample. If we are to attempt an integral Yoga, it will be as well to start with an idea of the Divine that is itself integral. There should be an aspiration in the heart wide enough for a realisation without any narrow limits. Not only should we avoid a sectarian religious outlook, but also all one-sided philosophical conceptions which try to shut up the Ineffable in a restricting mental formula. The dynamic conception or impelling sense with which our Yoga can best set out would be naturally the idea, the sense of a conscious all-embracing but all-exceeding Infinite. Our uplook must be to a free, all-powerful, perfect and blissful One and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Oneness</span> in which all beings move and live and through which all can meet and become one. This Eternal will be at once personal and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> in his self-revelation and touch upon the soul. He is personal because he is the conscious Divine, the infinite Person who casts some broken reflection of himself in the myriad divine and undivine personalities of the universe. He is impersonal because he appears to us<span class='page-number' id='s-82' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.82]</span> as an infinite Existence, Consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span> and because he is the fount, base and constituent of all existences and all energies, the very material of our being and mind and life and body, our spirit and our matter. The thought, concentrating on him, must not merely understand in an intellectual form that he exists, or conceive of him as an abstraction, a logical necessity; it must become a seeing thought able to meet him here as the Inhabitant in all, realise him in ourselves, watch and take hold on the movement of his forces. He is the one Existence: he is the original and universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Delight</span> that constitutes all things and exceeds them: he is the one infinite Consciousness that composes all consciousnesses and informs all their movements: he is the one illimitable Being who sustains all action and experience: his will guides the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of things towards their yet unrealised but inevitable aim and plenitude. To him the heart can consecrate itself, approach him as the supreme Beloved, beat and move in him as in a universal sweetness of Love and a living sea of Delight. For his is the secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Joy</span> that supports the soul in all its experiences and maintains even the errant ego in its ordeals and struggles till all sorrow and suffering shall cease. His is the Love and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> of the infinite divine Lover who is drawing all things by their own path towards his happy oneness. On him the Will can unalterably fix as the invisible Power that guides and fulfils it and as the source of its strength. In the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span> this actuating Power is a self-illumined Force that contains all results and calmly works until it accomplishes, in the personality an all-wise and omnipotent Master of the Yoga whom nothing can prevent from leading it to its goal. This is the faith with which the seeker has to begin his seeking and endeavour; for in all his effort here, but most of all in his effort towards the Unseen, mental man must perforce proceed by faith. When the realisation comes, the faith divinely fulfilled and completed will be transformed into an eternal flame of knowledge.\n\n---\n\nInto all our endeavour upward the lower element of desire will<span class='page-number' id='s-83' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.83]</span> at first naturally enter. For what the enlightened will sees as the thing to be done and pursues as the crown to be conquered, what the heart embraces as the one thing delightful, that in us which feels itself limited and opposed and, because it is limited, craves and struggles, will seek with the troubled passion of an egoistic desire. This craving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> in us has to be accepted at first, but only in order that it may be transformed. Even from the very beginning it has to be taught to renounce all other desires and concentrate itself on the passion for the Divine. This capital point gained, it has to be taught to desire, not for its own separate sake, but for God in the world and for the Divine in ourselves; it has to fix itself upon no personal spiritual gain, though of all possible spiritual gains we are sure, but on the great work to be done in us and others, on the high coming manifestation which is to be the glorious fulfilment of the Divine in the world, on the Truth that has to be sought and lived and enthroned for ever. But last, most difficult for it, more difficult than to seek with the right object, it has to be taught to seek in the right manner; for it must learn to desire, not in its own egoistic way, but in the way of the Divine. It must insist no longer, as the strong separative will always insists, on its own manner of fulfilment, its own dream of possession, its own idea of the right and the desirable; it must yearn to fulfil a larger and greater Will and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to wait upon a less interested and ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. Thus trained, Desire, that great unquiet harasser and troubler of man and cause of every kind of stumbling, will become fit to be transformed into its divine counterpart. For desire and passion too have their divine forms; there is a pure ecstasy of the soul's seeking beyond all craving and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, there is a Will of Ananda that sits glorified in the possession of the supreme beatitudes.\n\nWhen once the object of concentration has possessed and is possessed by the three master instruments, the thought, the heart and the will,—a consummation fully possible only when the desire-soul in us has submitted to the Divine Law,—the perfection of mind and life and body can be effectively fulfilled in our transmuted nature. This will be done, not for the personal satisfaction of the ego, but that the whole may constitute a fit<span class='page-number' id='s-84' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.84]</span> temple for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Presence</span>, a faultless instrument for the divine work. For that work can be truly performed only when the instrument, consecrated and perfected, has grown fit for a selfless action,—and that will be when personal desire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> are abolished, but not the liberated individual. Even when the little ego has been abolished, the true spiritual Person can still remain and God's will and work and delight in him and the spiritual use of his perfection and fulfilment. Our works will then be divine and done divinely; our mind and life and will, devoted to the Divine, will be used to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> fulfil in others and in the world that which has been first realised in ourselves,—all that we can manifest of the embodied Unity, Love, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Freedom</span>, Strength, Power, Splendour, immortal Joy which is the goal of the Spirit's terrestrial adventure.\n\nThe Yoga must start with an effort or at least a settled turn towards this total concentration. A constant and unfailing will of consecration of all ourselves to the Supreme is demanded of us, an offering of our whole being and our many-chambered nature to the Eternal who is the All. The effective fullness of our concentration on the one thing needful to the exclusion of all else will be the measure of our self-consecration to the One who is alone desirable. But this exclusiveness will in the end exclude nothing except the falsehood of our way of seeing the world and our will's ignorance. For our concentration on the Eternal will be consummated by the mind when we see constantly the Divine in itself and the Divine in ourselves, but also the Divine in all things and beings and happenings. It will be consummated by the heart when all emotion is summed up in the love of the Divine,—of the Divine in itself and for itself, but love too of the Divine in all its beings and powers and personalities and forms in the Universe. It will be consummated by the will when we feel and receive always the divine impulsion and accept that alone as our sole motive force; but this will mean that, having slain to the last rebellious straggler the wandering impulses of the egoistic nature, we have universalised ourselves and can accept with a constant happy acceptance the one divine working in all things. This is the first fundamental siddhi of the integral Yoga.<span class='page-number' id='s-85' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.85]</span>\n\nIt is nothing less that is meant in the end when we speak of the absolute consecration of the individual to the Divine. But this total fullness of consecration can only come by a constant progression when the long and difficult process of transforming desire out of existence is completed in an ungrudging measure. Perfect self-consecration implies perfect self-surrender.\n\n---\n\nFor here, there are two movements with a transitional stage between them, two periods of this Yoga,—one of the process of surrender, the other of its crown and consequence. In the first the individual prepares himself for the reception of the Divine into his members. For all this first period he has to work by means of the instruments of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower Nature</span>, but aided more and more from above. But in the later transitional stage of this movement our personal and necessarily ignorant effort more and more dwindles and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher Nature</span> acts; the eternal Shakti descends into this limited form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mortality</span> and progressively possesses and transmutes it. In the second period the greater movement wholly replaces the lesser, formerly indispensable first action; but this can be done only when our self-surrender is complete. The ego person in us cannot transform itself by its own force or will or knowledge or by any virtue of its own into the nature of the Divine; all it can do is to fit itself for the transformation and make more and more its surrender to that which it seeks to become. As long as the ego is at work in us, our personal action is and must always be in its nature a part of the lower grades of existence; it is obscure or half-enlightened, limited in its field, very partially effective in its power. If a spiritual transformation, not a mere illumining modification of our nature, is to be done at all, we must call in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> to effect that miraculous work in the individual; for she alone has the needed force, decisive, all-wise and illimitable. But the entire substitution of the divine for the human personal action is not at once entirely possible. All interference from below that would falsify the truth of the superior action must first be inhibited or rendered impotent,<span class='page-number' id='s-86' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.86]</span> and it must be done by our own free choice. A continual and always repeated refusal of the impulsions and falsehoods of the lower nature is asked from us and an insistent support to the Truth as it grows in our parts; for the progressive settling into our nature and final perfection of the incoming informing Light, Purity and Power needs for its development and sustenance our free acceptance of it and our stubborn rejection of all that is contrary to it, inferior or incompatible.\n\nIn the first movement of self-preparation, the period of personal effort, the method we have to use is this concentration of the whole being on the Divine that it seeks and, as its corollary, this constant rejection, throwing out, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>katharsis</span>*, of all that is not the true Truth of the Divine. An entire consecration of all that we are, think, feel and do will be the result of this persistence. This consecration in its turn must culminate in an integral self-giving to the Highest; for its crown and sign of completion is the whole nature's all-comprehending absolute surrender. In the second stage of the Yoga, transitional between the human and the divine working, there will supervene an increasing purified and vigilant passivity, a more and more luminous divine response to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Force</span>, but not to any other; and there will be as a result the growing inrush of a great and conscious miraculous working from above. In the last period there is no effort at all, no set method, no fixed sadhana; the place of endeavour and tapasya will be taken by a natural, simple, powerful and happy disclosing of the flower of the Divine out of the bud of a purified and perfected terrestrial nature. These are the natural successions of the action of the Yoga.\n\nThese movements are indeed not always or absolutely arranged in a strict succession to each other. The second stage begins in part before the first is completed; the first continues in part until the second is perfected; the last divine working can manifest from time to time as a promise before it is finally settled and normal to the nature. Always too there is something higher and greater than the individual which leads him even in his personal labour and endeavour. Often he may become, and remain for a time, wholly conscious, even in parts of his being<span class='page-number' id='s-87' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.87]</span> permanently conscious, of this greater leading behind the veil, and that may happen long before his whole nature has been purified in all its parts from the lower indirect control. Even, he may be thus conscious from the beginning; his mind and heart, if not his other members, may respond to that seizing and penetrating guidance with a certain initial completeness from the very first steps of the Yoga. But it is the constant and complete and uniform action of the great direct control that more and more distinguishes the transitional stage as it proceeds and draws to its close. This predominance of a greater diviner leading, not personal to ourselves, indicates the nature's increasing ripeness for a total spiritual transformation. It is the unmistakable sign that the self-consecration has not only been accepted in principle but is fulfilled in act and power. The Supreme has laid his luminous hand upon a chosen human vessel of his miraculous Light and Power and Ananda.<span class='page-number' id='s-88' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.88]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/self-consecration","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"Self-Surrender in Works - The Way of the Gita","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/self-surrender-in-works-the-way-of-the-gita","prvt":"The Four Aids","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-four-aids","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["self-surrender-in-works-the-way-of-the-gita"],"t":"Self-Surrender in Works - The Way of the Gita","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life</span>, not a remote silent or high-uplifted ecstatic Beyond-Life alone, is the field of our Yoga.

The sum of movement of these activities eventuates in an internal growth which is partly visible and operative in this life, partly a seed of progress in lives hereafter. This growth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>, an expansion, an increasing self-expression, a more and more harmonised development of his constituent members is the whole meaning and all the pith of human existence. It is for this meaningful development of consciousness by thought, will, emotion, desire, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and experience, leading in the end to a supreme divine self-discovery, that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Man</span>, the<span class='page-number' id='s-89' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.89]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>, has entered into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. All the rest is either auxiliary and subordinate or accidental and otiose; that only matters which sustains and helps the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of his nature and the growth or rather the progressive unfolding and discovery of his self and spirit.\n\nThe aim set before our Yoga is nothing less than to hasten this supreme object of our existence here. Its process leaves behind the ordinary tardy method of slow and confused growth through the evolution of Nature. For the natural evolution is at its best an uncertain growth under cover, partly by the pressure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, partly by a groping <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and an ill-lighted purposeful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, an only partially illumined and half-automatic use of opportunities with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> blunders and lapses and relapses; a great portion of it is made up of apparent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>accidents</span> and circumstances and vicissitudes,—though veiling a secret divine intervention and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. In Yoga we replace this confused crooked crab-motion by a rapid, conscious and self-directed evolution which is planned to carry us, as far as can be, in a straight line towards the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> set before us. In a certain sense it may be an error to speak of a goal anywhere in a progression which may well be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span>. Still we can conceive of an immediate goal, an ulterior objective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> our present achievement towards which the soul in man can aspire. There lies before him the possibility of a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>; there can be an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into a higher and wider plane of being and its descent to transform his members. An enlarged and illumined consciousness is possible that shall make of him a liberated spirit and a perfected <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>—and, if spread beyond the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>, it might even constitute a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> or else a new, a supramental and therefore a superhuman race. It is this new birth that we make our aim: a growth into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> is the whole meaning of our Yoga, an integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> not only of the soul but of all the parts of our nature.\n\n---\n\nOur purpose in Yoga is to exile the limited outward-looking<span class='page-number' id='s-90' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.90]</span> ego and to enthrone <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in its place as the ruling Inhabitant of the nature. And this means, first, to disinherit desire and no longer accept the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of desire as the ruling human motive. The spiritual life will draw its sustenance not from desire but from a pure and selfless spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of essential existence. And not only the vital nature in us whose stamp is desire, but the mental being too must undergo a new birth and a transfiguring change. Our divided, egoistic, limited and ignorant thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> must disappear; in its place there must stream in the catholic and faultless play of a shadowless divine illumination which shall culminate in the end in a natural self-existent Truth-consciousness free from groping half-truth and stumbling error. Our confused and embarrassed ego-centred small-motived will and action must cease and make room for the total working of a swiftly powerful, lucidly automatic, divinely moved and guided unfallen Force. There must be implanted and activised in all our doings a supreme, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>, unfaltering and unstumbling will in spontaneous and untroubled unison with the will of the Divine. The unsatisfying surface play of our feeble egoistic emotions must be ousted and there must be revealed instead a secret deep and vast psychic heart within that waits behind them for its hour; all our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, impelled by this inner heart in which dwells the Divine, will be transmuted into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and intense movements of a twin passion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span></span> and manifold <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. This is the definition of a divine humanity or a supramental race. This, not an exaggerated or even a sublimated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and action, is the type of the superman whom we are called to evolve by our Yoga.\n\nIn the ordinary human existence an outgoing action is obviously three-fourths or even more of our life. It is only the exceptions, the saint and the seer, the rare thinker, poet and artist who can live more within themselves; these indeed, at least in the most intimate parts of their nature, shape themselves more in inner thought and feeling than in the surface act. But it is not either of these sides separated from the other, but rather a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of the inner and the outer life made one in fullness and transfigured into a play of something that is beyond them which<span class='page-number' id='s-91' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.91]</span> will create the form of a perfect living. A Yoga of works, a union with the Divine in our will and acts—and not only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and feeling—is then an indispensable, an inexpressibly important element of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>. The conversion of our thought and feeling without a corresponding conversion of the spirit and body of our works would be a maimed achievement.\n\nBut if this total conversion is to be done, there must be a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span> of our actions and outer movements as much as of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and heart to the Divine. There must be accepted and progressively accomplished a surrender of our capacities of working into the hands of a greater Power behind us and our sense of being the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> and worker must disappear. All must be given for a more direct use into the hands of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> which is hidden by these frontal appearances; for by that permitting Will alone is our action possible. A hidden Power is the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> and overruling Observer of our acts and only he knows through all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and perversion and deformation brought in by the ego their entire sense and ultimate purpose. There must be effected a complete transformation of our limited and distorted egoistic life and works into the large and direct outpouring of a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Life</span>, Will and Energy that now secretly supports us. This greater Will and Energy must be made conscious in us and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>; no longer must it remain, as now, only a superconscious, upholding and permitting Force. There must be achieved an undistorted transmission through us of the all-wise purpose and process of a now hidden omniscient Power and omnipotent Knowledge which will turn into its pure, unobstructed, happily consenting and participating channel all our transmuted nature. This total consecration and surrender and this resultant entire transformation and free transmission make up the whole fundamental means and the ultimate aim of an integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Karmayoga</span>.\n\nEven for those whose first natural movement is a consecration, a surrender and a resultant entire transformation of the thinking mind and its knowledge, or a total consecration, surrender and transformation of the heart and its emotions, the consecration of works is a needed element in that change. Otherwise, although they may find God in other-life, they will not be<span class='page-number' id='s-92' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.92]</span> able to fulfil the Divine in life; life for them will be a meaningless undivine inconsequence. Not for them the true victory that shall be the key to the riddle of our terrestrial existence; their love will not be the absolute love triumphant over self, their knowledge will not be the total consciousness and the all-embracing knowledge. It is possible, indeed, to begin with knowledge or Godward emotion solely or with both together and to leave works for the final movement of the Yoga. But there is then this disadvantage that we may tend to live too exclusively within, subtilised in subjective experience, shut off in our isolated inner parts; there we may get incrusted in our spiritual seclusion and find it difficult later on to pour ourselves triumphantly outwards and apply to life our gains in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher Nature</span>. When we turn to add this external kingdom also to our inner conquests, we shall find ourselves too much accustomed to an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> purely subjective and ineffective on the material plane. There will be an immense difficulty in transforming the outer life and the body. Or we shall find that our action does not correspond with the inner light: it still follows the old accustomed mistaken paths, still obeys the old normal imperfect influences; the Truth within us continues to be separated by a painful gulf from the ignorant mechanism of our external nature. This is a frequent experience because in such a process the Light and Power come to be self-contained and unwilling to express themselves in life or to use the physical means prescribed for the Earth and her processes. It is as if we were living in another, a larger and subtler world and had no divine hold, perhaps little hold of any kind, upon the material and terrestrial existence.\n\nBut still each must follow his nature, and there are always <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> that have to be accepted for some time if we are to pursue our natural path of Yoga. Yoga is after all primarily a change of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner consciousness</span> and nature, and if the balance of our parts is such that this must be done first with an initial exclusiveness and the rest left for later handling, we must accept the apparent imperfection of the process. Yet would the ideal working of an integral Yoga be a movement, even from the beginning, integral in its process and whole and many-sided in<span class='page-number' id='s-93' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.93]</span> its progress. In any case our present preoccupation is with a Yoga, integral in its aim and complete movement, but starting from works and proceeding by works although at each step more and more moved by a vivifying divine love and more and more illumined by a helping divine knowledge.\n\n---\n\nThe greatest gospel of spiritual works ever yet given to the race, the most perfect system of Karmayoga known to man in the past, is to be found in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhagavad <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span></span>. In that famous episode of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span> the great basic lines of Karmayoga are laid down for all time with an incomparable mastery and the infallible eye of an assured experience. It is true that the path alone, as the ancients saw it, is worked out fully: the perfect fulfilment, the highest secret[^1] is hinted rather than developed; it is kept back as an unexpressed part of a supreme mystery. There are obvious reasons for this reticence; for the fulfilment is in any case a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> for experience and no teaching can express it. It cannot be described in a way that can really be understood by a mind that has not the effulgent transmuting experience. And for the soul that has passed the shining portals and stands in the blaze of the inner light, all mental and verbal description is as poor as it is superfluous, inadequate and an impertinence. All divine consummations have perforce to be figured by us in the inapt and deceptive terms of a language which was made to fit the normal experience of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span>; so expressed, they can be rightly understood only by those who already know, and, knowing, are able to give these poor external terms a changed, inner and transfigured sense. As the Vedic Rishis insisted in the beginning, the words of the supreme wisdom are expressive only to those who are already of the wise. The Gita at its cryptic close may seem by its silence to stop short of that solution for which we are seeking; it pauses at the borders of the highest spiritual mind and does not cross them into the splendours of the supramental<span class='page-number' id='s-94' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.94]</span> Light. And yet its secret of dynamic, and not only static, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> with the inner Presence, its highest mystery of absolute surrender to the Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guide</span>, Lord and Inhabitant of our nature, is the central secret. This surrender is the indispensable means of the supramental change and, again, it is through the supramental change that the dynamic identity becomes possible.\n\n[^1]: *rahasyam uttamam.*\n\nWhat then are the lines of Karmayoga laid down by the Gita? Its key principle, its spiritual method, can be summed up as the union of two largest and highest states or powers of consciousness, equality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. The kernel of its method is an unreserved acceptance of the Divine in our life as in our inner self and spirit. An inner renunciation of personal desire leads to equality, accomplishes our total surrender to the Divine, supports a delivery from dividing ego which brings us oneness. But this must be a oneness in dynamic force and not only in static peace or inactive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span>. The Gita promises us <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> for the spirit even in the midst of works and the full energies of Nature, if we accept subjection of our whole being to that which is higher than the separating and limiting ego. It proposes an integral dynamic activity founded on a still passivity; a largest possible action irrevocably based on an immobile calm is its secret,—free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> out of a supreme inward silence.\n\nAll things here are the one and indivisible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> transcendent and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> that is in its seeming divided in things and creatures; in seeming only, for in truth it is always one and equal in all things and creatures and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> is only a phenomenon of the surface. As long as we live in the ignorant seeming, we are the ego and are subject to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of Nature</span>. Enslaved to appearances, bound to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span>, tossed between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, sin and virtue, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>, pain and pleasure, good <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span> and ill fortune, success and failure, we follow helplessly the iron or gilt and iron round of the wheel of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. At best we have only the poor relative freedom which by us is ignorantly called <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>free-will</span>. But that is at bottom illusory, since it is the modes of Nature that express themselves through our personal will; it is force of Nature, grasping us, ungrasped by us that determines what we shall will and how we shall will it. Nature, not<span class='page-number' id='s-95' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.95]</span> an independent ego, chooses what object we shall seek, whether by reasoned will or unreflecting impulse, at any moment of our existence. If, on the contrary, we live in the unifying reality of the Brahman, then we go beyond the ego and overstep Nature. For then we get back to our true self and become the spirit; in the spirit we are above the impulsion of Nature, superior to her modes and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>. Attaining to a perfect equality in the soul, mind and heart, we realise our true self of oneness, one with all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, one too with That which expresses itself in them and in all that we see and experience. This equality and this oneness are the indispensable twin foundation we must lay down for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine being</span>, a divine consciousness, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span>. Not one with all, we are not spiritual, not divine. Not equal-souled to all things, happenings and creatures, we cannot see spiritually, cannot know divinely, cannot feel divinely towards others. The Supreme Power, the one Eternal and Infinite is equal to all things and to all beings; and because it is equal, it can act with an absolute wisdom according to the truth of its works and its force and according to the truth of each thing and of every creature.\n\nThis is also the only true freedom possible to man,—a freedom which he cannot have unless he outgrows his mental separativeness and becomes the conscious soul in Nature. The only free will in the world is the one divine Will of which Nature is the executrix; for she is the master and creator of all other wills. Human free-will can be real in a sense, but, like all things that belong to the modes of Nature, it is only relatively real. The mind rides on a swirl of natural forces, balances on a poise between several possibilities, inclines to one side or another, settles and has the sense of choosing: but it does not see, it is not even dimly aware of the Force behind that has determined its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>. It cannot see it, because that Force is something total and to our eyes indeterminate. At most mind can only distinguish with an approach to clarity and precision some out of the complex variety of particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>determinations</span> by which this Force works out her incalculable purposes. Partial itself, the mind rides on a part of the machine, unaware of nine-tenths of its motor agencies in Time and environment, unaware of its past<span class='page-number' id='s-96' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.96]</span> preparation and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> drift; but because it rides, it thinks that it is directing the machine. In a sense it counts: for that clear inclination of the mind which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> our will, that firm settling of the inclination which presents itself to us as a deliberate choice, is one of Nature's most powerful determinants; but it is never independent and sole. Behind this petty instrumental action of the human will there is something vast and powerful and eternal that oversees the trend of the inclination and presses on the turn of the will. There is a total Truth in Nature greater than our individual choice. And in this total Truth, or even beyond and behind it, there is something that determines all results; its presence and secret knowledge keep up steadily in the process of Nature a dynamic, almost automatic perception of the right relations, the varying or persistent necessities, the inevitable steps of the movement. There is a secret divine Will, eternal and infinite, omniscient and omnipotent, that expresses itself in the universality and in each particular of all these apparently temporal and finite inconscient or half-conscient things. This is the Power or Presence meant by the Gita when it speaks of the Lord within the heart of all existences who turns all creatures as if mounted on a machine by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of Nature.\n\nThis divine Will is not an alien Power or Presence; it is intimate to us and we ourselves are part of it: for it is our own highest Self that possesses and supports it. Only, it is not our conscious mental will; it rejects often enough what our conscious will accepts and accepts what our conscious will rejects. For while this secret One knows all and every whole and each detail, our surface mind knows only a little part of things. Our will is conscious in the mind, and what it knows, it knows by the thought only; the divine Will is superconscious to us because it is in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> supra-mental, and it knows all because it is all. Our highest Self which possesses and supports this universal Power is not our ego-self, not our personal nature; it is something transcendent and universal of which these smaller things are only foam and flowing surface. If we surrender our conscious will and allow it to be made one with the will of the Eternal, then, and then only, shall we attain to a true freedom; living in the divine<span class='page-number' id='s-97' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.97]</span> liberty, we shall no longer cling to this shackled so-called freewill, a puppet freedom ignorant, illusory, relative, bound to the error of its own inadequate vital motives and mental figures.\n\n---\n\nA distinction has to be firmly seized in our consciousness, the capital distinction between mechanical Nature and the free Lord of Nature, between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> or single luminous divine Will and the many executive modes and forces of the universe.\n\nNature,—not as she is in her divine Truth, the conscious Power of the Eternal, but as she appears to us in the Ignorance,—is executive Force, mechanical in her steps, not consciously intelligent to our experience of her, although all her works are instinct with an absolute intelligence. Not in herself master, she is full of a self-aware Power[^2] which has an infinite mastery and, because of this Power driving her, she rules all and exactly fulfils the work intended in her by the Ishwara. Not enjoying but enjoyed, she bears in herself the burden of all enjoyments. Nature as Prakriti is an inertly active Force,—for she works out a movement imposed upon her; but within her is One that knows,—some Entity sits there that is aware of all her motion and process. Prakriti works containing the knowledge, the mastery, the delight of the Purusha, the Being associated with her or seated within her; but she can participate in them only by subjection and reflection of that which fills her. Purusha knows and is still and inactive; he contains the action of Prakriti within his consciousness and knowledge and enjoys it. He gives the sanction to Prakriti's works and she works out what is sanctioned by him for his pleasure. Purusha himself does not execute; he maintains Prakriti in her action and allows her to express in energy and process and formed result what he perceives in his knowledge. This is the distinction made by the Sankhyas; and although it is not all the true truth, not in any way the highest truth either<span class='page-number' id='s-98' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.98]</span> of Purusha or of Prakriti, still it is a valid and indispensable practical knowledge in the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hemisphere</span> of existence.\n\n[^2]: This Power is the conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Shakti</span> of the Ishwara, the transcendent and universal Mother.\n\nThe individual soul or the conscious being in a form may identify itself with this experiencing Purusha or with this active Prakriti. If it identifies itself with Prakriti, it is not master, enjoyer and knower, but reflects the modes and workings of Prakriti. It enters by its identification into that subjection and mechanical working which is characteristic of her. And even, by an entire immersion in Prakriti, this soul becomes inconscient or subconscient, asleep in her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> as in the earth and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metal</span> or almost asleep as in plant life. There, in that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span>, it is subject to the domination of tamas, the principle, the power, the qualitative mode of obscurity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>: sattwa and rajas are there, but they are concealed in the thick coating of tamas. Emerging into its own proper nature of consciousness but not yet truly conscious, because there is still too great a domination of tamas in the nature, the embodied being becomes more and more subject to rajas, the principle, the power, the qualitative mode of action and passion impelled by desire and instinct. There is then formed and developed the animal nature, narrow in consciousness, rudimentary in intelligence, rajaso-tamasic in vital habit and impulse. Emerging yet farther from the great Inconscience towards a spiritual status the embodied being liberates sattwa, the mode of light, and acquires a relative freedom and mastery and knowledge and with it a qualified and conditioned sense of inner satisfaction and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span>. Man, the mental being in a physical body, should be but is not, except in a few among this multitude of ensouled bodies, of this nature. Ordinarily he has too much in him of the obscure earth-inertia and a troubled ignorant animal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> to be a soul of light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> or even a mind of harmonious will and knowledge. There is here in man an incomplete and still hampered and baffled ascension towards the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the Purusha, free, master, knower and enjoyer. For these are in human and earthly experience relative modes, none <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> its single and absolute fruit; all are intermixed with each other and there is not the pure action of any one of them anywhere. It is their confused and inconstant interaction that<span class='page-number' id='s-99' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.99]</span> determines the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> of the egoistic human consciousness swinging in Nature's uncertain balance.\n\nThe sign of the immersion of the embodied soul in Prakriti is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> of consciousness to the ego. The vivid stamp of this limited consciousness can be seen in a constant inequality of the mind and heart and a confused conflict and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disharmony</span> in their varied reactions to the touches of experience. The human reactions sway perpetually between the dualities created by the soul's subjection to Nature and by its often intense but narrow struggle for mastery and enjoyment, a struggle for the most part ineffective. The soul circles in an unending round of Nature's alluring and distressing opposites, success and failure, good fortune and ill fortune, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good and evil</span>, sin and virtue, joy and grief, pain and pleasure. It is only when, awaking from its immersion in Prakriti, it perceives its oneness with the One and its oneness with all existences that it can become free from these things and found its right relation to this executive world-Nature. Then it becomes indifferent to her inferior modes, equal-minded to her dualities, capable of mastery and freedom; it is seated above her as the high-throned knower and witness filled with the calm intense unalloyed delight of his own eternal existence. The embodied spirit continues to express its powers in action, but it is no longer involved in ignorance, no longer bound by its works; its actions have no longer a consequence within it, but only a consequence outside in Prakriti. The whole movement of Nature becomes to its experience a rising and falling of waves on the surface that make no difference to its own unfathomable peace, its wide delight, its vast universal equality or its boundless God-existence.[^3]<span class='page-number' id='s-100' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.100]</span>\n\n[^3]: It is not indispensable for the Karmayoga to accept implicitly all the philosophy of the Gita. We may regard it, if we like, as a statement of psychological experience useful as a practical basis for the Yoga; here it is perfectly valid and in entire consonance with a high and wide experience. For this reason I have thought it well to state it here, as far as possible in the language of modern thought, omitting all that belongs to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphysics</span> rather than to psychology.\n\n---\n\nThese are the conditions of our effort and they point to an ideal which can be expressed in these or in equivalent formulae.\n\nTo live in God and not in the ego; to move, vastly founded, not in the little egoistic consciousness, but in the consciousness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All-Soul</span> and the Transcendent.\n\nTo be perfectly equal in all happenings and to all beings, and to see and feel them as one with oneself and one with the Divine; to feel all in oneself and all in God; to feel God in all, oneself in all.\n\nTo act in God and not in the ego. And here, first, not to choose action by reference to personal needs and standards, but in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to the dictates of the living highest Truth above us. Next, as soon as we are sufficiently founded in the spiritual consciousness, not to act any longer by our separate will or movement, but more and more to allow action to happen and develop under the impulsion and guidance of a divine Will that surpasses us. And last, the supreme result, to be exalted into an identity in knowledge, force, consciousness, act, joy of existence with the Divine Shakti; to feel a dynamic movement not dominated by mortal desire and vital instinct and impulse and illusive mental free-will, but luminously conceived and evolved in an immortal self-delight and an infinite self-knowledge. For this is the action that comes by a conscious subjection and merging of the natural man into the divine Self and eternal Spirit; it is the Spirit that for ever transcends and guides this world-Nature.\n\n---\n\nBut by what practical steps of self-discipline can we arrive at this consummation?\n\nThe elimination of all egoistic activity and of its foundation, the egoistic consciousness, is clearly the key to the consummation we desire. And since in the path of works action is the knot we have first to loosen, we must endeavour to loosen it where it is centrally tied, in desire and in ego; for otherwise we shall cut only stray strands and not the heart of our bondage. These are the two knots of our subjection to this ignorant and<span class='page-number' id='s-101' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.101]</span> divided Nature, desire and ego-sense. And of these two desire has its native home in the emotions and sensations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span> and from there affects thought and volition; ego-sense lives indeed in these movements, but it casts its deep roots also in the thinking mind and its will and it is there that it becomes fully selfconscious. These are the twin obscure powers of the obsessing world-wide Ignorance that we have to enlighten and eliminate.\n\nIn the field of action desire takes many forms, but the most powerful of all is the vital self's craving or seeking after the fruit of our works. The fruit we covet may be a reward of internal pleasure; it may be the accomplishment of some preferred idea or some cherished will or the satisfaction of the egoistic emotions, or else the pride of success of our highest hopes and ambitions. Or it may be an external reward, a recompense entirely material,—wealth, position, honour, victory, good fortune or any other fulfilment of vital or physical desire. But all alike are lures by which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> holds us. Always these satisfactions delude us with the sense of mastery and the idea of freedom, while really we are harnessed and guided or ridden and whipped by some gross or subtle, some noble or ignoble, figure of the blind Desire that drives the world. Therefore the first rule of action laid down by the Gita is to do the work that should be done without any desire for the fruit, *niṣkāma karma*.\n\nA simple rule in appearance, and yet how difficult to carry out with anything like an absolute sincerity and liberating entireness! In the greater part of our action we use the principle very little if at all, and then even mostly as a sort of counterpoise to the normal principle of desire and to mitigate the extreme action of that tyrant impulse. At best, we are satisfied if we arrive at a modified and disciplined egoism not too shocking to our moral sense, not too brutally offensive to others. And to our partial self-discipline we give various <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> and forms; we habituate ourselves by practice to the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>, to a firm fidelity to principle, a stoical fortitude or a religious resignation, a quiet or an ecstatic submission to God's will. But it is not these things that the Gita intends, useful though they are in their place; it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> at something absolute, unmitigated, uncompromising, a<span class='page-number' id='s-102' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.102]</span> turn, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> that will change the whole poise of the soul. Not the mind's control of vital impulse is its rule, but the strong immobility of an immortal spirit.\n\nThe test it lays down is an absolute equality of the mind and the heart to all results, to all reactions, to all happenings. If good fortune and ill fortune, if respect and insult, if reputation and obloquy, if victory and defeat, if pleasant event and sorrowful event leave us not only unshaken but untouched, free in the emotions, free in the nervous reactions, free in the mental view, not responding with the least disturbance or vibration in any spot of the nature, then we have the absolute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> to which the Gita points us, but not otherwise. The tiniest reaction is a proof that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> is imperfect and that some part of us accepts ignorance and bondage as its law and clings still to the old nature. Our self-conquest is only partially accomplished; it is still imperfect or unreal in some stretch or part or smallest spot of the ground of our nature. And that little pebble of imperfection may throw down the whole achievement of the Yoga!\n\nThere are certain semblances of an equal spirit which must not be mistaken for the profound and vast spiritual equality which the Gita teaches. There is an equality of disappointed resignation, an equality of pride, an equality of hardness and indifference: all these are egoistic in their nature. Inevitably they come in the course of the sadhana, but they must be rejected or transformed into the true quietude. There is too, on a higher level, the equality of the stoic, the equality of a devout resignation or a sage <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span>, the equality of a soul aloof from the world and indifferent to its doings. These too are insufficient; first approaches they can be, but they are at most early soul-phases only or imperfect mental preparations for our entry into the true and absolute self-existent wide evenness of the spirit.\n\nFor it is certain that so great a result cannot be arrived at immediately and without any previous stages. At first we have to learn to bear the shocks of the world with the central part of our being untouched and silent, even when the surface mind, heart,<span class='page-number' id='s-103' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.103]</span> life are strongly shaken; unmoved there on the bedrock of our life, we must separate the soul watching behind or immune deep within from these outer workings of our nature. Afterwards, extending this calm and steadfastness of the detached soul to its instruments, it will become slowly possible to radiate peace from the luminous centre to the darker peripheries. In this process we may take the passing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of many minor phases; a certain stoicism, a certain calm philosophy, a certain religious exaltation may help us towards some nearness to our aim, or we may call in even less strong and exalted but still useful powers of our mental nature. In the end we must either discard or transform them and arrive instead at an entire equality, a perfect self-existent peace within and even, if we can, a total unassailable, self-poised and spontaneous delight in all our members.\n\nBut how then shall we continue to act at all? For ordinarily the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> acts because he has a desire or feels a mental, vital or physical want or need; he is driven by the necessities of the body, by the lust of riches, honours or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span>, or by a craving for the personal satisfactions of the mind or the heart or a craving for power or pleasure. Or he is seized and pushed about by a moral need or, at least, the need or the desire of making his ideas or his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> or his will or his party or his country or his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> prevail in the world. If none of these desires nor any other must be the spring of our action, it would seem as if all incentive or motive power had been removed and action itself must necessarily cease. The Gita replies with its third great secret of the divine life. All action must be done in a more and more Godward and finally a God-possessed consciousness; our works must be a sacrifice to the Divine and in the end a surrender of all our being, mind, will, heart, sense, life and body to the One must make God-love and God-service our only motive. This transformation of the motive force and very character of works is indeed its master idea; it is the foundation of its unique synthesis of works, love and knowledge. In the end not desire, but the consciously felt will of the Eternal remains as the sole driver of our action and the sole originator of its initiative.<span class='page-number' id='s-104' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.104]</span>\n\nEquality, renunciation of all desire for the fruit of our works, action done as a sacrifice to the supreme Lord of our nature and of all nature,—these are the three first Godward approaches in the Gita's way of Karmayoga.<span class='page-number' id='s-105' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.105]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/self-surrender-in-works-the-way-of-the-gita","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Sacrifice, the Triune Path and the Lord of the Sacrifice","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-sacrifice-the-triune-path-and-the-lord-of-the-sacrifice","prvt":"Self-Consecration","prvu":"/cwsa/23/self-consecration","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-sacrifice-the-triune-path-and-the-lord-of-the-sacrifice"],"t":"The Sacrifice, the Triune Path and the Lord of the Sacrifice","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The law of sacrifice is the common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> that was thrown out into the world in its beginning as a symbol of the solidarity of the universe.

It is its admission that, even in this much fragmented <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, there is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> itself and behind that which is not its own egoistic person, something greater and completer, a diviner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> which demands from it subordination and service. Indeed, sacrifice is imposed and, where need be, compelled by the universal World-Force; it takes it even from those who do not consciously recognise the law,—inevitably, because this is the intrinsic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of things. Our ignorance or our false egoistic view of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> can make no difference to this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> bedrock truth of Nature. For this is the truth in Nature, that this ego which thinks itself a separate independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> and claims to live for itself, is not and cannot be independent nor separate, nor can it live to itself even if it would, but rather all are linked together by a secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Oneness</span>. Each existence is continually <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> out perforce from its stock; out of its mental receipts from Nature or its vital and physical assets and acquisitions and belongings a stream goes to all that is around it. And<span class='page-number' id='s-106' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.106]</span> always again it receives something from its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> gratis or in return for its voluntary or involuntary tribute. For it is only by this giving and receiving that it can effect its own growth while at the same time it helps the sum of things. At length, though at first slowly and partially, we learn to make the conscious sacrifice; even, in the end, we take <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> to give ourselves and what we envisage as belonging to us in a spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> to That which appears for the moment other than ourselves and is certainly other than our limited personalities. The sacrifice and the divine return for our sacrifice then become a gladly accepted means towards our last perfection; for it is recognised now as the road to the fulfilment in us of the eternal purpose.\n\nBut, most often, the sacrifice is done unconsciously, egoistically and without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> or acceptance of the true meaning of the great world-rite. It is so that the vast majority of earth-creatures do it; and, when it is so done, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> derives only a mechanical minimum of natural inevitable profit, achieves by it only a slow painful progress limited and tortured by the smallness and suffering of the ego. Only when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, the will and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of knowledge associate themselves with the law and gladly follow it, can there come the deep joy and the happy fruitfulness of divine sacrifice. The mind's knowledge of the law and the heart's gladness in it culminate in the perception that it is to our own Self and Spirit and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> Self and Spirit of all that we give. And this is true even when our self-offering is still to our fellow-creatures or to lesser Powers and Principles and not yet to the Supreme. \"Not for the sake of the wife,\" says Yajnavalkya in the Upanishad, \"but for the sake of the Self is the wife dear to us.\" This in the lower sense of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span> is the hard <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> behind the coloured and passionate professions of egoistic love; but in a higher sense it is the inner significance of that love too which is not egoistic but divine. All true love and all sacrifice are in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> Nature's contradiction of the primary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> and its separative error; it is her attempt to turn from a necessary first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fragmentation</span> towards a recovered oneness. All unity between creatures is in its essence a self-finding, a fusion with that from which we have separated, a discovery of one's self in others.<span class='page-number' id='s-107' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.107]</span>\n\nBut it is only a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> and unity that can possess in the light what the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of these things seek for in the darkness. For the true unity is not merely an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> and agglomeration like that of physical cells joined by a life of common interests; it is not even an emotional understanding, sympathy, solidarity or close drawing together. Only then are we really unified with those separated from us by the divisions of Nature, when we annul the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> and find ourselves in that which seemed to us not ourselves. Association is a vital and physical unity; its sacrifice is that of mutual aid and concessions. Nearness, sympathy, solidarity create a mental, moral and emotional unity; theirs is a sacrifice of mutual support and mutual gratifications. But the true unity is spiritual; its sacrifice is a mutual self-giving, an interfusion of our inner substance. The law of sacrifice travels in Nature towards its culmination in this complete and unreserved self-giving; it awakens the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of one common self in the giver and the object of the sacrifice. This culmination of sacrifice is the height even of human love and devotion when it tries to become divine; for there too the highest peak of love points into a heaven of complete mutual self-giving, its summit is the rapturous fusing of two souls into one.\n\nThis profounder idea of the world-wide law is at the heart of the teaching about works given in the Gita; a spiritual union with the Highest by sacrifice, an unreserved self-giving to the Eternal is the core of its doctrine. The vulgar conception of sacrifice is an act of painful self-immolation, austere self-mortification, difficult self-effacement; this kind of sacrifice may go even as far as self-mutilation and self-torture. These things may be temporarily necessary in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>'s hard endeavour to exceed his natural self; if the egoism in his nature is violent and obstinate, it has to be met sometimes by an answering strong internal repression and counterbalancing violence. But the Gita discourages any excess of violence done to oneself; for the self within is really the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span> evolving, it is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span>, it is the Divine; it has not to be troubled and tortured as the Titans of the world trouble and torture it, but to be increased, fostered, cherished, luminously opened to a divine light and strength and joy and wideness. It<span class='page-number' id='s-108' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.108]</span> is not one's self, but the band of the spirit's inner enemies that we have to discourage, expel, slay upon the altar of the growth of the spirit; these can be ruthlessly excised, whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> are desire, wrath, inequality, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>greed</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to outward pleasures and pains, the cohort of usurping demons that are the cause of the soul's errors and sufferings. These should be regarded not as part of oneself but as intruders and perverters of our self's real and diviner nature; these have to be sacrificed in the harsher sense of the word, whatever pain in going they may throw by reflection on the consciousness of the seeker.\n\nBut the true essence of sacrifice is not self-immolation, it is self-giving; its object not self-effacement, but self-fulfilment; its method not self-mortification, but a greater life, not self-mutilation, but a transformation of our natural human parts into divine members, not self-torture, but a passage from a lesser satisfaction to a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. There is only one thing painful in the beginning to a raw or turbid part of the surface nature; it is the indispensable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> demanded, the denial necessary for the merging of the incomplete ego. But for that there can be a speedy and enormous compensation in the discovery of a real greater or ultimate completeness in others, in all things, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> oneness, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of the transcendent Self and Spirit, in the rapture of the touch of the Divine. Our sacrifice is not a giving without any return or any fruitful acceptance from the other side; it is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>interchange</span> between the embodied soul and conscious Nature in us and the eternal Spirit. For even though no return is demanded, yet there is the knowledge deep within us that a marvellous return is inevitable. The soul knows that it does not give itself to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in vain; claiming nothing, it yet receives the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> riches of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> and Presence.\n\nLast, there is to be considered the recipient of the sacrifice and the manner of the sacrifice. The sacrifice may be offered to others or it may be offered to divine Powers; it may be offered to the cosmic All or it may be offered to the transcendent Supreme. The worship given may take any shape from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dedication</span> of a leaf or flower, a cup of water, a handful of rice, a loaf of bread, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span> of all that we possess and the submission of all<span class='page-number' id='s-109' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.109]</span> that we are. Whoever the recipient, whatever the gift, it is the Supreme, the Eternal in things, who receives and accepts it, even if it be rejected or ignored by the immediate recipient. For the Supreme who transcends the universe, is yet here too, however veiled, in us and in the world and in its happenings; he is there as the omniscient Witness and Receiver of all our works and their secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span>. All our actions, all our efforts, even our sins and stumblings and sufferings and struggles are obscurely or consciously, known to us and seen or else unknown and in a disguise, governed in their last result by the One. All is turned towards him in his numberless forms and offered through them to the single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Omnipresence</span>. In whatever form and with whatever spirit we approach him, in that form and with that spirit he receives the sacrifice.\n\nAnd the fruit also of the sacrifice of works varies according to the work, according to the intention in the work and according to the spirit that is behind the intention. But all other sacrifices are partial, egoistic, mixed, temporal, incomplete,—even those offered to the highest Powers and Principles keep this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>: the result too is partial, limited, temporal, mixed in its reactions, effective only for a minor or intermediate purpose. The one entirely acceptable sacrifice is a last and highest and uttermost self-giving,—it is that surrender made face to face, with devotion and knowledge, freely and without any reserve to One who is at once our immanent Self, the environing constituent All, the Supreme Reality beyond this or any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> and, secretly, all these together, concealed everywhere, the immanent Transcendence. For to the soul that wholly gives itself to him, God also gives himself altogether. Only the one who offers his whole nature, finds the Self. Only the one who can give everything, enjoys the Divine All everywhere. Only a supreme self-abandonment attains to the Supreme. Only the sublimation by sacrifice of all that we are, can enable us to embody the Highest and live here in the immanent consciousness of the transcendent Spirit.<span class='page-number' id='s-110' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.110]</span>\n\n---\n\nThis, in short, is the demand made on us, that we should turn our whole life into a conscious sacrifice. Every moment and every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of our being is to be resolved into a continuous and a devoted self-giving to the Eternal. All our actions, not less the smallest and most ordinary and trifling than the greatest and most uncommon and noble, must be performed as consecrated acts. Our individualised nature must live in the single consciousness of an inner and outer movement dedicated to Something that is beyond us and greater than our ego. No matter what the gift or to whom it is presented by us, there must be a consciousness in the act that we are presenting it to the one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Being</span> in all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>. Our commonest or most grossly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> actions must assume this sublimated character; when we eat, we should be conscious that we are giving our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> to that Presence in us; it must be a sacred <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> in a temple and the sense of a mere physical need or self-gratification must pass away from us. In any great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span>, in any high discipline, in any difficult or noble enterprise, whether undertaken for ourselves, for others or for the race, it will no longer be possible to stop short at the idea of the race, of ourselves or of others. The thing we are doing must be consciously offered as a sacrifice of works, not to these, but either through them or directly to the One Godhead; the Divine Inhabitant who was hidden by these figures must be no longer hidden but ever present to our soul, our mind, our sense. The workings and results of our acts must be put in the hands of that One in the feeling that that Presence is the Infinite and Most High by whom alone our labour and our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> are possible. For in his being all takes place; for him all labour and aspiration are taken from us by Nature and offered on his altar. Even in those things in which Nature is herself very plainly the worker and we only the witnesses of her working and its containers and supporters, there should be the same constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> and insistent consciousness of a work and of its divine Master. Our very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and respiration, our very heart-beats can and must be made conscious in us as the living rhythm of the universal sacrifice.\n\nIt is clear that a conception of this kind and its effective<span class='page-number' id='s-111' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.111]</span> practice must carry in them three results that are of a central importance for our spiritual ideal. It is evident, to begin with, that, even if such a discipline is begun without devotion, it leads straight and inevitably towards the highest devotion possible; for it must deepen naturally into the completest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> imaginable, the most profound God-love. There is bound up with it a growing sense of the Divine in all things, a deepening communion with the Divine in all our thought, will and action and at every moment of our lives, a more and more moved consecration to the Divine of the totality of our being. Now these implications of the Yoga of works are also of the very essence of an integral and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhakti</span>. The seeker who puts them into living practice makes in himself continually a constant, active and effective representation of the very spirit of self-devotion, and it is inevitable that out of it there should emerge the most engrossing worship of the Highest to whom is given this service. An absorbing love for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Presence</span> to whom he feels an always more intimate closeness, grows upon the consecrated worker. And with it is born or in it is contained a universal love too for all these beings, living forms and creatures that are habitations of the Divine—not the brief restless grasping <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> of division, but the settled selfless love that is the deeper vibration of oneness. In all the seeker begins to meet the one Object of his adoration and service. The way of works turns by this road of sacrifice to meet the path of Devotion; it can be itself a devotion as complete, as absorbing, as integral as any the desire of the heart can ask for or the passion of the mind can imagine.\n\nNext, the practice of this Yoga demands a constant inward remembrance of the one central liberating knowledge, and a constant active externalising of it in works comes in too to intensify the remembrance. In all is the one Self, the one Divine is all; all are in the Divine, all are the Divine and there is nothing else in the universe,—this thought or this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> is the whole background until it becomes the whole substance of the consciousness of the worker. A memory, a self-dynamising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> of this kind, must and does in its end turn into a profound and uninterrupted<span class='page-number' id='s-112' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.112]</span> vision and a vivid and all-embracing consciousness of that which we so powerfully remember or on which we so constantly meditate. For it compels a constant reference at each moment to the Origin of all being and will and action and there is at once an embracing and exceeding of all particular forms and appearances in That which is their cause and upholder. This way cannot go to its end without a seeing vivid and vital, as concrete in its way as physical sight, of the works of the universal Spirit everywhere. On its summits it rises into a constant living and thinking and willing and acting in the presence of the Supramental, the Transcendent. Whatever we see and hear, whatever we touch and sense, all of which we are conscious, has to be known and felt by us as That which we worship and serve; all has to be turned into an image of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span>, perceived as a dwelling-place of his Godhead, enveloped with the eternal Omnipresence. In its close, if not long before it, this way of works turns by communion with the Divine Presence, Will and Force into a way of Knowledge more complete and integral than any the mere creature <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> can construct or the search of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> can discover.\n\nLastly, the practice of this Yoga of sacrifice compels us to renounce all the inner supports of egoism, casting them out of our mind and will and actions, and to eliminate its seed, its presence, its influence out of our nature. All must be done for the Divine; all must be directed towards the Divine. Nothing must be attempted for ourselves as a separate existence; nothing done for others, whether neighbours, friends, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span>, country or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> or other creatures merely because they are connected with our personal life and thought and sentiment or because the ego takes a preferential interest in their welfare. In this way of doing and seeing all works and all life become only a daily dynamic worship and service of the Divine in the unbounded temple of his own vast cosmic existence. Life becomes more and more the sacrifice of the eternal in the individual constantly self-offered to the eternal Transcendence. It is offered in the wide sacrificial ground of the field of the eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Spirit</span>; and the Force too that offers it is the eternal Force, the omnipresent<span class='page-number' id='s-113' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.113]</span> Mother. Therefore is this way a way of union and communion by acts and by the spirit and knowledge in the act as complete and integral as any our Godward will can hope for or our soul's strength execute.\n\nIt has all the power of a way of works integral and absolute, but because of its law of sacrifice and self-giving to the Divine Self and Master, it is accompanied on its one side by the whole power of the path of Love and on the other by the whole power of the path of Knowledge. At its end all these three divine Powers work together, fused, united, completed, perfected by each other.\n\n---\n\nThe Divine, the Eternal is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of our sacrifice of works and union with him in all our being and consciousness and in its expressive instruments is the one object of the sacrifice; the steps of the sacrifice of works must therefore be measured, first, by the growth in our nature of something that brings us nearer to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span>, but secondly also by an experience of the Divine, his presence, his manifestation to us, an increasing closeness and union with that Presence. But the Divine is in his essence infinite and his manifestation too is multitudinously infinite. If that is so, it is not likely that our true integral perfection in being and in nature can come by one kind of realisation alone; it must combine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> different strands of divine experience. It cannot be reached by the exclusive pursuit of a single line of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> till that is raised to its absolute; it must harmonise many aspects of the Infinite. An integral consciousness with a multiform dynamic experience is essential for the complete transformation of our nature.\n\nThere is one fundamental perception indispensable towards any integral knowledge or many-sided experience of this Infinite. It is to realise the Divine in its essential self and truth unaltered by forms and phenomena. Otherwise we are likely to remain caught in the net of appearances or wander confusedly in a chaotic multitude of cosmic or particular aspects, and if we<span class='page-number' id='s-114' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.114]</span> avoid this confusion, it will be at the price of getting chained to some mental formula or shut up in a limited personal experience. The one secure and all-reconciling truth which is the very foundation of the universe is this that life is the manifestation of an uncreated Self and Spirit, and the key to life's hidden secret is the true relation of this Spirit with its own created existences. There is behind all this life the look of an eternal Being upon its multitudinous becomings; there is around and everywhere in it the envelopment and penetration of a manifestation in time by an unmanifested timeless Eternal. But this knowledge is valueless for Yoga if it is only an intellectual and metaphysical notion void of life and barren of consequence; a mental realisation alone cannot be sufficient for the seeker. For what Yoga searches after is not truth of thought alone or truth of mind alone, but the dynamic truth of a living and revealing spiritual experience. There must awake in us a constant indwelling and enveloping nearness, a vivid perception, a close feeling and communion, a concrete sense and contact of a true and infinite Presence always and everywhere. That Presence must remain with us as the living, pervading Reality in which we and all things exist and move and act, and we must feel it always and everywhere, concrete, visible, inhabiting all things; it must be patent to us as their true Self, tangible as their imperishable Essence, met by us closely as their inmost Spirit. To see, to feel, to sense, to contact in every way and not merely to conceive this Self and Spirit here in all existences and to feel with the same vividness all existences in this Self and Spirit, is the fundamental experience which must englobe all other knowledge.\n\nThis infinite and eternal Self of things is an omnipresent Reality, one existence everywhere; it is a single unifying presence and not different in different creatures; it can be met, seen or felt in its completeness in each soul or each form in the universe. For its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> is spiritual and essential and not merely a boundlessness in Space or an endlessness in Time; the Infinite can be felt in an infinitesimal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>atom</span> or in a second of time as convincingly as in the stretch of the aeons or the stupendous enormity of the intersolar spaces. The knowledge or experience of it can begin<span class='page-number' id='s-115' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.115]</span> anywhere and express itself through anything; for the Divine is in all, and all is the Divine.\n\nThis fundamental experience will yet begin differently for different natures and take long to develop all the Truth that it conceals in its thousand aspects. I see perhaps or feel in myself or as myself first the eternal Presence and afterwards only can extend the vision or sense of this greater self of mine to all creatures. I then see the world in me or as one with me. I perceive the universe as a scene in my being, the play of its processes as a movement of forms and souls and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> in my cosmic spirit; I meet myself and none else everywhere. Not, be it well noted, with the error of the Asura, the Titan, who lives in his own inordinately magnified shadow, mistakes ego for the self and spirit and tries to impose his fragmentary personality as the one dominant existence upon all his surroundings. For, having the knowledge, I have already seized this reality that my true self is the non-ego, so always my greater Self is felt by me either as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> vastness or an essential Person containing yet beyond all personalities or as both these together; but in any case, whether Impersonal or illimitable Personal or both together, it is an ego-exceeding Infinite. If I have sought it out and found it first in the form of it I <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> myself rather than in others, it is only because there it is easiest for me, owing to the subjectivity of my consciousness, to find it, to know it at once and to realise it. But if the narrow instrumental ego does not begin to merge in this Self as soon as it is seen, if the smaller external mind-constructed I refuses to disappear into that greater permanent uncreated spiritual I, then my realisation is either not genuine or radically imperfect. There is somewhere in me an egoistic obstacle; some part of my nature has opposed a self-regarding and self-preserving denial to the all-swallowing truth of the Spirit.\n\nOn the other hand—and to some this is an easier way—I may see the Divinity first in the world outside me, not in myself but in others. I meet it there from the beginning as an indwelling and all-containing Infinite that is not bound up with all these<span class='page-number' id='s-116' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.116]</span> forms, creatures and forces which it bears on its surface. Or else I see and feel it as a pure solitary Self and Spirit which contains all these powers and existences, and I lose my sense of ego in the silent Omnipresence around me. Afterwards it is this that begins to pervade and possess my instrumental being and out of it seem to proceed all my impulsions to action, all my light of thought and speech, all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> of my consciousness and all its relations and impacts with other soul-forms of this one worldwide Existence. I am already no longer this little personal self, but That with something of itself put forward which sustains a selected form of its workings in the universe.\n\nThere is another basic realisation, the most extreme of all, that yet comes sometimes as the first decisive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> or an early turn of the Yoga. It is the awakening to an ineffable high transcendent Unknowable above myself and above this world in which I seem to move, a timeless and spaceless condition or entity which is at once, in some way compelling and convincing to an essential consciousness in me, the one thing that is to it overwhelmingly real. This experience is usually accompanied by an equally compelling sense either of the dreamlike or shadowy illusoriness of all things here or else of their temporary, derivative and only half-real character. For a time at least all around me may seem to be a moving of cinematographic shadow forms or surface figures and my own action may appear as a fluid formulation from some Source ungrasped as yet and perhaps unseizable above or outside me. To remain in this consciousness, to carry out this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> or follow out this first suggestion of the character of things would be to proceed towards the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> of self and world in the Unknowable,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Moksha</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. But this is not the only line of issue; it is possible, on the contrary, for me to wait till through the silence of this timeless unfilled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> I begin to enter into relations with that yet ungrasped Source of myself and my actions; then the void begins to fill, there emerges out of it or there rushes into it all the manifold Truth of the Divine, all the aspects and manifestations and many levels of a dynamic Infinite. At first this experience imposes on the mind and then on all our being an<span class='page-number' id='s-117' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.117]</span> absolute, a fathomless, almost an abysmal peace and silence. Overpowered and subjugated, stilled, liberated from itself, the mind accepts the Silence itself as the Supreme. But afterwards the seeker discovers that all is there for him contained or new-made in that silence or through it descends upon him from a greater concealed transcendent Existence. For this Transcendent, this Absolute is not a mere peace of signless emptiness; it has its own infinite contents and riches of which ours are debased and diminished values. If there were not that Source of all things, there could be no universe; all powers, all works and activities would be an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, all creation and manifestation would be impossible.\n\nThese are the three fundamental realisations, so fundamental that to the Yogin of the way of Knowledge they seem ultimate, sufficient in themselves, destined to overtop and replace all others. And yet for the integral seeker, whether accorded to him at an early stage suddenly and easily by a miraculous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> or achieved with difficulty after a long progress and endeavour, they are neither the sole truth nor the full and only clues to the integral truth of the Eternal, but rather the unfilled beginning, the vast foundation of a greater divine Knowledge. Other realisations there are that are imperatively needed and must be explored to the full limit of their possibilities; and if some of them appear to a first sight to cover only Divine Aspects that are instrumental to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of existence but not inherent in its essence, yet, when followed to their end through that activity to its everlasting Source, it is found that they lead to a disclosure of the Divine without which our knowledge of the Truth behind things would be left bare and incomplete. These seeming Instrumentals are the key to a secret without which the Fundamentals themselves would not unveil all their mystery. All the revelatory aspects of the Divine must be caught in the wide net of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>.\n\n---\n\nIf a departure from the world and its activities, a supreme release and quietude were the sole aim of the seeker, the three great<span class='page-number' id='s-118' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.118]</span> fundamental realisations would be sufficient for the fulfilment of his spiritual life: concentrated in them alone he could suffer all other divine or mundane knowledge to fall away from him and himself unencumbered, depart into the eternal Silence. But he has to take account of the world and its activities, learn what divine truth there may be behind them and reconcile that apparent opposition between the Divine Truth and the manifest creation which is the starting-point of most spiritual experience. Here, on each line of approach that he can take, he is confronted with a constant Duality, a separation between two terms of existence that seem to be opposites and their opposition to be the very root of the riddle of the universe. Later, he may and does discover that these are the two poles of One Being, connected by two simultaneous currents of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> negative and positive in relation to each other, their interaction the very condition for the manifestation of what is within the Being, their reunion the appointed means for the reconciliation of life's discords and for the discovery of the integral truth of which he is the seeker.\n\nFor on one side he is aware of this Self everywhere, this everlasting Spirit-Substance—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span>, the Eternal—the same self-existence here in time behind each appearance he sees or senses and timeless beyond the universe. He has this strong overpowering experience of a Self that is neither our limited ego nor our mind, life or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, world-wide but not outwardly phenomenal, yet to some spirit-sense in him more concrete than any form or phenomenon, universal yet not dependent for its being on anything in the universe or on the whole totality of the universe; if all this were to disappear, its extinction would make no difference to this Eternal of his constant intimate experience. He is sure of an inexpressible Self-Existence which is the essence of himself and all things; he is intimately aware of an essential Consciousness of which thinking mind and life-sense and body-sense are only partial and diminished figures, a Consciousness with an illimitable Force in it of which all energies are the outcome, but which is yet not explained or accounted for by the sum or power or nature of all these energies together; he feels, he lives in an inalienable self-existent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> which is not this lesser<span class='page-number' id='s-119' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.119]</span> transient joy or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> or pleasure. A changeless imperishable infinity, a timeless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span>, a self-awareness which is not this receptive and reactive or tentacular mental consciousness, but is behind and above it and present too below it, even in what we call Inconscience, a oneness in which there is no possibility of any other existence, are the fourfold character of this settled experience. Yet this eternal Self-Existence is seen by him also as a conscious Time-Spirit bearing the stream of happenings, a self-extended spiritual Space containing all things and beings, a Spirit-Substance which is the very form and material of all that seems non-spiritual, temporary and finite. For all that is transitory, temporal, spatial, bounded, is yet felt by him to be in its substance and energy and power no other than the One, the Eternal, the Infinite.\n\nAnd yet there is not only in him or before him this eternal self-aware Existence, this spiritual Consciousness, this infinity of self-illumined Force, this timeless and endless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beatitude</span>. There is too, constant also to his experience, this universe in measurable Space and Time, some kind perhaps of boundless finite, and in it all is transient, limited, fragmentary, plural, ignorant, exposed to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disharmony</span> and suffering, seeking vaguely for some unrealised yet inherent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of oneness, unconscious or half-conscious or, even when most conscious, still tied to the original Ignorance and Inconscience. He is not always in a trance of peace or bliss and, even if he were, it would be no solution, for he knows that this would still be going on outside him and yet within some larger self of him as if for ever. At times these two states of his spirit seem to exist for him alternately according to his state of consciousness; at others they are there as two parts of his being, disparate and to be reconciled, two halves, an upper and a lower or an inner and an outer half of his existence. He finds soon that this separation in his consciousness has an immense liberative power; for by it he is no longer bound to the Ignorance, the Inconscience; it no longer appears to him the very nature of himself and things but an illusion which can be overcome or at least a temporary wrong self-experience, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. It is tempting to regard it as only a contradiction of the Divine,<span class='page-number' id='s-120' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.120]</span> an incomprehensible mystery-play, masque or travesty of the Infinite—and so it irresistibly seems to his experience at times, on one side the luminous verity of Brahman, on the other a dark illusion of Maya. But something in him will not allow him to cut existence thus permanently in two and, looking more closely, he discovers that in this half-light or darkness too is the Eternal—it is the Brahman who is here with this face of Maya.\n\nThis is the beginning of a growing spiritual experience which reveals to him more and more that what seemed to him dark incomprehensible Maya was all the time no other than the Consciousness-Puissance of the Eternal, timeless and illimitable beyond the universe, but spread out here under a mask of bright and dark opposites for the miracle of the slow manifestation of the Divine in Mind and Life and Matter. All the Timeless presses towards the play in Time; all in Time turns upon and around the timeless Spirit. If the separate experience was liberative, this unitive experience is dynamic and effective. For he now not only feels himself to be in his soul-substance part of the Eternal, in his essential self and spirit entirely one with the Eternal, but in his active nature an instrumentation of its omniscient and omnipotent Consciousness-Puissance. However bounded and relative its present play in him, he can open to a greater and greater consciousness and power of it and to that expansion there seems to be no assignable limit. A level spiritual and supramental of that Consciousness-Puissance seems even to reveal itself above him and lean to enter into contact, where there are not these trammels and limits, and its powers too are pressing upon the play in Time with the promise of a greater descent and a less disguised or no longer disguised manifestation of the Eternal. The once conflicting but now biune duality of Brahman-Maya stands revealed to him as the first great dynamic aspect of the Self of all selves, the Master of existence, the Lord of the world-sacrifice and of his sacrifice.\n\nOn another line of approach another Duality presents itself to the experience of the seeker. On one side he becomes aware of a witness recipient observing experiencing Consciousness which does not appear to act but for which all these activities inside<span class='page-number' id='s-121' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.121]</span> and outside us seem to be undertaken and continue. On the other side he is aware at the same time of an executive Force or an energy of Process which is seen to constitute, drive and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> all conceivable activities and to create a myriad forms visible to us and invisible and use them as stable supports for its incessant flux of action and creation. Entering exclusively into the witness consciousness he becomes silent, untouched, immobile; he sees that he has till now passively reflected and appropriated to himself the movements of Nature and it is by this reflection that they acquired from the witness soul within him what seemed a spiritual value and significance. But now he has withdrawn that ascription or mirroring identification; he is conscious only of his silent self and aloof from all that is in motion around it; all activities are outside him and at once they cease to be intimately real; they appear now mechanical, detachable, endable. Entering exclusively into the kinetic movement, he has an opposite self-awareness; he seems to his own perception a mass of activities, a formation and result of forces; if there is an active consciousness, even some kind of kinetic being in the midst of it all, yet there is no longer a free soul in it anywhere. These two different and opposite states of being alternate in him or else stand simultaneously over against each other; one silent in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span> observes but is unmoved and does not participate; the other active in some outer or surface self pursues its habitual movements. He has entered into an intense separative perception of the great duality, Soul-Nature, Purusha-Prakriti.\n\nBut as the consciousness deepens, he becomes aware that this is only a first frontal appearance. For he finds that it is by the silent support, permission or sanction of this witness soul in him that this executive nature can work intimately or persistently upon his being; if the soul withdraws its sanction, the movements of Nature in their action upon and within him become a wholly mechanical repetition, vehement at first as if seeking still to enforce their hold, but afterwards less and less dynamic and real. More actively using this power of sanction or refusal, he perceives that he can, slowly and uncertainly at first,<span class='page-number' id='s-122' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.122]</span> more decisively afterwards, change the movements of Nature. Eventually in this witness soul or behind it is revealed to him the presence of a Knower and master Will in Nature, and all her activities more and more appear as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of what is known and either actively willed or passively permitted by this Lord of her existence. Prakriti herself now seems to be mechanical only in the carefully regulated appearance of her workings, but in fact a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious Force</span> with a soul within her, a self-aware significance in her turns, a revelation of a secret Will and Knowledge in her steps and figures. This Duality, in aspect separate, is inseparable. Wherever there is Prakriti, there is Purusha; wherever there is Purusha, there is Prakriti. Even in his inactivity he holds in himself all her force and energies ready for projection; even in the drive of her action she carries with her all his observing and mandatory consciousness as the whole support and sense of her creative purpose. Once more the seeker discovers in his experience the two poles of existence of One Being and the two lines or currents of their energy negative and positive in relation to each other which effect by their simultaneity the manifestation of all that is within it. Here too he finds that the separative aspect is liberative; for it releases him from the bondage of identification with the inadequate workings of Nature in the Ignorance. The unitive aspect is dynamic and effective; for it enables him to arrive at mastery and perfection; while rejecting what is less divine or seemingly undivine in her, he can rebuild her forms and movements in himself according to a nobler pattern and the law and rhythm of a greater existence. At a certain spiritual and supramental level the Duality becomes still more perfectly Two-in-one, the Master Soul with the Conscious Force within it, and its potentiality disowns all barriers and breaks through every limit. Thus this once separate, now biune Duality of Purusha-Prakriti is revealed to him in all its truth as the second great instrumental and effective aspect of the Soul of all souls, the Master of existence, the Lord of the Sacrifice.\n\nOn yet another line of approach the seeker meets another corresponding but in aspect distinct Duality in which the biune<span class='page-number' id='s-123' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.123]</span> character is more immediately apparent,—the dynamic Duality of Ishwara-Shakti. On one side he is aware of an infinite and self-existent Godhead in being who contains all things in an ineffable potentiality of existence, a Self of all selves, a Soul of all souls, a spiritual Substance of all substances, an impersonal inexpressible Existence, but at the same time an illimitable Person who is here self-represented in numberless personality, a Master of Knowledge, a Master of Forces, a Lord of love and bliss and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, a single Origin of the worlds, a self-manifester and self-creator, a Cosmic Spirit, a universal Mind, a universal Life, the conscious and living Reality supporting the appearance which we sense as unconscious inanimate Matter. On the other side he becomes aware of the same Godhead in effectuating consciousness and power put forth as a self-aware Force that contains and carries all within her and is charged to manifest it in universal Time and Space. It is evident to him that here there is one supreme and infinite Being represented to us in two different sides of itself, obverse and reverse in relation to each other. All is either prepared or pre-existent in the Godhead in Being and issues from it and is upheld by its Will and Presence; all is brought out, carried in movement by the Godhead in power; all becomes and acts and develops by her and in her its individual or its cosmic purpose. It is again a Duality necessary for the manifestation, creating and enabling that double current of energy which seems always necessary for the world-workings, two poles of the same Being, but here closer to each other and always very evidently carrying each the powers of the other in its essence and its dynamic nature. At the same time by the fact that the two great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the divine Mystery, the Personal and the Impersonal, are here fused together, the seeker of the integral Truth feels in the duality of Ishwara-Shakti his closeness to a more intimate and ultimate secret of the divine Transcendence and the Manifestation than that offered to him by any other experience.\n\nFor the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwari Shakti</span>, divine Conscious-Force and World-Mother, becomes a mediatrix between the eternal One and the manifested Many. On one side, by the play of the energies which she brings from the One, she manifests the multiple Divine in the<span class='page-number' id='s-124' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.124]</span> universe, involving and evolving its endless appearances out of her revealing substance; on the other by the reascending current of the same energies she leads back all towards That from which they have issued so that the soul in its evolutionary manifestation may more and more return towards the Divinity there or here put on its divine character. There is not in her, although she devises a cosmic mechanism, the character of an inconscient mechanical Executrix which we find in the first physiognomy of Prakriti, the Nature-Force; neither is there that sense of an Unreality, creatrix of illusions or semi-illusions, which is attached to our first view of Maya. It is at once clear to the experiencing soul that here is a conscious Power of one substance and nature with the Supreme from whom she came. If she seems to have plunged us into the Ignorance and Inconscience in pursuance of a plan we cannot yet interpret, if her forces present themselves as all these ambiguous forces of the universe, yet it becomes visible before long that she is working for the development of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Consciousness</span> in us and that she stands above drawing us to her own higher entity, revealing to us more and more the very essence of the Divine Knowledge, Will and Ananda. Even in the movements of the Ignorance the soul of the seeker becomes aware of her conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> supporting his steps and leading them slowly or swiftly, straight or by many detours out of the darkness into the light of a greater consciousness, out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mortality</span> into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>, out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> and suffering towards a highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and felicity of which as yet his human mind can form only a faint image. Thus her power is at once liberative and dynamic, creative, effective,—creative not only of things as they are, but of things that are to be; for, eliminating the twisted and tangled movements of his lower consciousness made of the stuff of the Ignorance, it rebuilds and new-makes his soul and nature into the substance and forces of a higher divine Nature.\n\nIn this Duality too there is possible a separative experience. At one pole of it the seeker may be conscious only of the Master of Existence putting forth on him His energies of knowledge, power and bliss to liberate and divinise; the Shakti may appear to him only an impersonal Force expressive of these things or<span class='page-number' id='s-125' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.125]</span> an attribute of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>. At the other pole he may encounter the World-Mother, creatrix of the universe, putting forth the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span> and the worlds and all things and existences out of her spirit-substance. Or even if he sees both aspects, it may be with an unequal separating vision, subordinating one to the other, regarding the Shakti only as a means for approaching the Ishwara. There results a one-sided tendency or a lack of balance, a power of effectuation not perfectly supported or a light of revelation not perfectly dynamic. It is when a complete union of the two sides of the Duality is effected and rules his consciousness that he begins to open to a fuller power that will draw him altogether out of the confused clash of Ideas and Forces here into a higher Truth and enable the descent of that Truth to illumine and deliver and act sovereignly upon this world of Ignorance. He has begun to lay his hand on the integral secret which in its fullness can be grasped only when he overpasses the double term that reigns here of Knowledge inextricably intertwined with an original Ignorance and crosses the border where spiritual mind disappears into supramental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gnosis</span>. It is through this third and most dynamic dual aspect of the One that the seeker begins with the most integral completeness to enter into the deepest secret of the being of the Lord of the Sacrifice.\n\nFor it is behind the mystery of the presence of personality in an apparently impersonal universe—as in that of consciousness manifesting out of the Inconscient, life out of the inanimate, soul out of brute Matter—that is hidden the solution of the riddle of existence. Here again is another dynamic Duality more pervading than appears at first view and deeply necessary to the play of the slowly self-revealing Power. It is possible for the seeker in his spiritual experience, standing at one pole of the Duality, to follow Mind in seeing a fundamental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Impersonality</span> everywhere. The evolving soul in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span> begins from a vast impersonal Inconscience in which our inner sight yet perceives the presence of a veiled infinite Spirit; it proceeds with the emergence of a precarious consciousness and personality that even at their fullest have the look of an episode, but an episode that repeats itself in a constant series; it arises through experience<span class='page-number' id='s-126' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.126]</span> of life out of mind into an infinite, impersonal and absolute Superconscience in which personality, mind-consciousness, life-consciousness seem all to disappear by a liberating annihilation, Nirvana. At a lower pitch he still <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> this fundamental impersonality as an immense liberating force everywhere. It releases his knowledge from the narrowness of personal mind, his will from the clutch of personal desire, his heart from the bondage of petty mutable emotions, his life from its petty personal groove, his soul from ego, and it allows them to embrace <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, equality, wideness, universality, infinity. A Yoga of works would seem to require Personality as its mainstay, almost its source, but here too the impersonal is found to be the most direct liberating force; it is through a wide egoless impersonality that one can become a free worker and a divine creator. It is not surprising that the overwhelming power of this experience from the impersonal pole of the Duality should have moved the sages to declare this to be the one way and an impersonal Superconscience to be the sole truth of the Eternal.\n\nBut still to the seeker standing at the opposite pole of the Duality another line of experience appears which justifies an intuition deeply-seated behind the heart and in our very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span>, that personality, like consciousness, life, soul, is not a brief-lived stranger in an impersonal Eternity, but contains the very meaning of existence. This fine flower of the cosmic Energy carries in it a forecast of the aim and a hint of the very motive of the universal labour. As an occult vision opens in him, he becomes aware of worlds behind in which consciousness and personality hold an enormous place and assume a premier value; even here in the material world to this occult vision the inconscience of Matter fills with a secret pervading consciousness, its inanimation harbours a vibrant life, its mechanism is the device of an indwelling Intelligence, God and soul are everywhere. Above all stands an infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious Being</span> who is variously self-expressed in all these worlds; impersonality is only a first means of that expression. It is a field of principles and forces, an equal basis of manifestation; but these forces express themselves through beings, have conscious spirits at their head and are<span class='page-number' id='s-127' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.127]</span> the emanation of a One Conscious Being who is their source. A multiple innumerable personality expressing that One is the very sense and central aim of the manifestation and if now personality seems to be narrow, fragmentary, restrictive, it is only because it has not opened to its source or flowered into its own divine truth and fullness packing itself with the universal and the infinite. Thus the world-creation is no more an illusion, a fortuitous mechanism, a play that need not have happened, a flux without consequence; it is an intimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dynamism</span> of the conscious and living Eternal.\n\nThis extreme opposition of view from the two poles of one Existence creates no fundamental difficulty for the seeker of the integral Yoga; for his whole experience has shown him the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of these double terms and their currents of Energy, negative and positive in relation to each other, for the manifestation of what is within the one Existence. For himself Personality and Impersonality have been the two wings of his spiritual ascension and he has the prevision that he will reach a height where their helpful interaction will pass into a fusion of their powers and disclose the integral Reality and release into action the original force of the Divine. Not only in the fundamental Aspects but in all the working of his sadhana he has felt their double truth and mutually complementary working. An impersonal Presence has dominated from above or penetrated and occupied his nature; a Light descending has suffused his mind, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span>, the very cells of his body, illumined them with knowledge, revealed him to himself down to his most disguised and unsuspected movements, exposing, purifying, destroying or brilliantly changing all that belonged to the Ignorance. A Force has poured into him in currents or like a sea, worked in his being and all its members, dissolved, new-made, reshaped, transfigured everywhere. A Bliss has invaded him and shown that it can make suffering and sorrow impossible and turn pain itself into divine pleasure. A Love without limits has joined him to all creatures or revealed to him a world of inseparable intimacy and unspeakable sweetness and beauty and begun to impose its law of perfection and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> even amidst the disharmony of terrestrial life. A spiritual<span class='page-number' id='s-128' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.128]</span> Truth and Right have convicted the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good and evil</span> of this world of imperfection or of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> and unveiled a supreme good and its clue of subtle harmony and its sublimation of action and feeling and knowledge. But behind all these and in them he has felt a Divinity who is all these things, a Bringer of Light, a Guide and All-Knower, a Master of Force, a Giver of Bliss, Friend, Helper, Father, Mother, Playmate in the world-game, an absolute Master of his being, his soul's Beloved and Lover. All relations known to human personality are there in the soul's contact with the Divine; but they rise towards superhuman levels and compel him towards a divine nature.\n\nIt is an integral knowledge that is being sought, an integral force, a total amplitude of union with the All and Infinite behind existence. For the seeker of the integral Yoga no single experience, no one Divine Aspect,—however overwhelming to the human mind, sufficient for its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, easily accepted as the sole or the ultimate reality,—can figure as the exclusive truth of the Eternal. For him the experience of the Divine Oneness carried to its extreme is more deeply embraced and amply fathomed by following out to the full the experience of the Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Multiplicity</span>. All that is true behind polytheism as well as behind monotheism falls within the scope of his seeking; but he passes beyond their superficial sense to human mind to grasp their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> truth in the Divine. He sees what is aimed at by the jarring sects and philosophies and accepts each facet of the Reality in its own place, but rejects their narrownesses and errors and proceeds farther till he discovers the One Truth that binds them together. The reproach of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anthropomorphism</span> and anthropolatry cannot deter him,—for he sees them to be prejudices of the ignorant and arrogant reasoning intelligence, the abstracting mind turning on itself in its own cramped circle. If human relations as practised now by man are full of smallness and perversity and ignorance, yet are they disfigured shadows of something in the Divine and by turning them to the Divine he finds that of which they are a shadow and brings it down for manifestation in life. It is through the human exceeding itself and opening itself to a supreme plenitude that the Divine must manifest itself here, since<span class='page-number' id='s-129' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.129]</span> that comes inevitably in the course and process of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>, and therefore he will not despise or blind himself to the Godhead because it is lodged in a human body, *mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam*. Beyond the limited human conception of God, he will pass to the one divine Eternal, but also he will meet him in the faces of the Gods, his cosmic personalities supporting the World-Play, detect him behind the mask of the Vibhutis, embodied World-Forces or human Leaders, reverence and obey him in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guru</span>, worship him in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Avatar</span>. This will be to him his exceeding good <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span> if he can meet one who has realised or is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> That which he seeks for and can by opening to it in this vessel of its manifestation himself realise it. For that is the most palpable sign of the growing fulfilment, the promise of the great mystery of the progressive Descent into Matter which is the secret sense of the material creation and the justification of terrestrial existence.\n\nThus reveals himself to the seeker in the progress of the sacrifice the Lord of the sacrifice. At any point this revelation can begin; in any aspect the Master of the Work can take up the work in him and more and more press upon him and it for the unfolding of his presence. In time all the Aspects disclose themselves, separate, combine, fuse, are unified together. At the end there shines through it all the supreme integral Reality, unknowable to Mind which is part of the Ignorance, but knowable because self-aware in the light of a spiritual consciousness and a supramental knowledge.\n\n---\n\nThis revelation of a highest Truth or a highest Being, Consciousness, Power, Bliss and Love, impersonal and personal at once and so taking up both sides of our own being,—since in us also is the ambiguous meeting of a Person and a mass of impersonal principles and forces,—is at once the first aim and the condition of the ultimate achievement of the sacrifice. The achievement itself takes the shape of a union of our own existence with That which is thus made manifest to our vision and experience, and<span class='page-number' id='s-130' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.130]</span> the union has a threefold character. There is a union in spiritual essence, by identity; there is a union by the indwelling of our soul in this highest Being and Consciousness; there is a dynamic union of likeness or oneness of nature between That and our instrumental being here. The first is the liberation from the Ignorance and identification with the Real and Eternal, *mokṣa*, *sāyujya*, which is the characteristic aim of the Yoga of Knowledge. The second, the dwelling of the soul with or in the Divine, *sāmīpya*, *sālokya*, is the intense hope of all Yoga of love and beatitude. The third, identity in nature, likeness to the Divine, to be perfect as That is perfect, is the high intention of all Yoga of power and perfection or of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine works</span> and service. The combined completeness of the three together, founded here on a multiple Unity of the self-manifesting Divine, is the complete result of the integral Yoga, the goal of its triple Path and the fruit of its triple sacrifice.\n\nA union by identity may be ours, a liberation and change of our substance of being into that supreme Spirit-substance, of our consciousness into that divine Consciousness, of our soul-state into that ecstasy of spiritual beatitude or that calm eternal bliss of existence. A luminous indwelling in the Divine can be attained by us secure against any fall or exile into this lower consciousness of the darkness and the Ignorance, the soul ranging freely and firmly in its own natural world of light and joy and freedom and oneness. And since this is not merely to be attained in some other existence beyond but pursued and discovered here also, it can only be by a descent, by a bringing down of the Divine Truth, by the establishment here of the soul's native world of light, joy, freedom, oneness. A union of our instrumental being no less than of our soul and spirit must change our imperfect nature into the very likeness and image of Divine Nature; it must put off the blind, marred, mutilated, discordant movements of the Ignorance and put on the inherence of that light, peace, bliss, harmony, universality, mastery, purity, perfection; it must convert itself into a receptacle of divine knowledge, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of divine Will-Power and Force of Being, a channel of divine Love, Joy and Beauty. This is the transformation to be effected,<span class='page-number' id='s-131' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.131]</span> an integral transformation of all that we now are or seem to be, by the joining—Yoga—of the finite being in Time with the Eternal and Infinite.\n\nAll this difficult result can become possible only if there is an immense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span>, a total reversal of our consciousness, a supernormal entire transfiguration of the nature. There must be an ascension of the whole being, an ascension of spirit chained here and trammelled by its instruments and its environment to sheer Spirit free above, an ascension of soul towards some blissful Super-soul, an ascension of mind towards some luminous Supermind, an ascension of life towards some vast Super-life, an ascension of our very physicality to join its origin in some pure and plastic spirit-substance. And this cannot be a single swift upsoaring but, like the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> of the sacrifice described in the Veda, a climbing from peak to peak in which from each summit one looks up to the much more that has still to be done. At the same time there must be a descent too to affirm below what we have gained above: on each height we conquer we have to turn to bring down its power and its illumination into the lower mortal movement; the discovery of the Light for ever radiant on high must correspond with the release of the same Light secret below in every part down to the deepest caves of subconscient Nature. And this pilgrimage of ascension and this descent for the labour of transformation must be inevitably a battle, a long war with ourselves and with opposing forces around us which, while it lasts, may well seem interminable. For all our old obscure and ignorant nature will contend repeatedly and obstinately with the transforming Influence, supported in its lagging unwillingness or its stark resistance by most of the established forces of environing universal Nature; the powers and principalities and the ruling beings of the Ignorance will not easily give up their empire.\n\nAt first there may have to be a prolonged, often tedious and painful period of preparation and purification of all our being till it is ready and fit for an opening to a greater Truth and Light or to the Divine Influence and Presence. Even when centrally fitted, prepared, open already, it will still be long before<span class='page-number' id='s-132' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.132]</span> all our movements of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>, all the multiple and conflicting members and elements of our personality <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> or, consenting, are able to bear the difficult and exacting process of the transformation. And hardest of all, even if all in us is willing, is the struggle we shall have to carry through against the universal forces attached to the present unstable creation when we seek to make the final supramental conversion and reversal of consciousness by which the Divine Truth must be established in us in its plenitude and not merely what they would more readily permit, an illumined Ignorance.\n\nIt is for this that a surrender and submission to That which is beyond us enabling the full and free working of its Power is indispensable. As that self-giving progresses, the work of the sacrifice becomes easier and more powerful and the prevention of the opposing Forces loses much of its strength, impulsion and substance. Two inner changes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> most to convert what now seems difficult or impracticable into a thing possible and even sure. There takes place a coming to the front of some secret inmost soul within which was veiled by the restless activity of the mind, by the turbulence of our vital impulses and by the obscurity of the physical consciousness, the three powers which in their confused combination we now call our self. There will come about as a result a less impeded growth of a Divine Presence at the centre with its liberating Light and effective Force and an irradiation of it into all the conscious and subconscious ranges of our nature. These are the two signs, one marking our completed conversion and consecration to the great Quest, the other the final acceptance by the Divine of our sacrifice.<span class='page-number' id='s-133' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.133]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-sacrifice-the-triune-path-and-the-lord-of-the-sacrifice","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i","prvt":"Self-Surrender in Works - The Way of the Gita","prvu":"/cwsa/23/self-surrender-in-works-the-way-of-the-gita","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i"],"t":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"This then is in its foundations the integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the Supreme and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span> to whom we offer our sacrifice, and this the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the sacrifice itself in its triple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>,—a sacrifice of works, a sacrifice of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span>, a sacrifice of knowledge.

What then becomes of the present activities of our being, activities of the mind turned towards knowledge and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of knowledge, activities of our emotional and sensational parts, activities of outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, production, the will turned towards mastery over men, things, life, the world, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of Nature? Are they to be abandoned and to be replaced by some other way of living in which a spiritualised consciousness can find its true expression and figure? Are they to be maintained as they are in their outward appearance, but transformed by an inner spirit in the act or enlarged in scope and liberated into new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> by a reversal of consciousness such as was seen on earth when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> took up the vital activities of the animal to mentalise and extend and transfigure them by the infusion of reason, thinking will, refined emotion, an organised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>? Or is there to be an abandonment in part, a preservation only of such of them as can bear a spiritual change and, for the rest, the creation of a new life expressive, in its form no less than in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and motive-force, of the unity, wideness, peace, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of the liberated spirit? It is this problem most of all that has exercised the minds of those who have tried to trace the paths that lead from the human to the Divine in the long journey of the Yoga.\n\nEvery kind of solution has been offered from the entire abandonment of works and life, so far as that is physically possible, to the acceptance of life as it is but with a new spirit animating and uplifting its movements, in appearance the same as they were but changed in the spirit behind them and therefore in their inner significance. The extreme solution insisted on by the world-shunning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> or the inward-turned ecstatical and self-oblivious mystic is evidently foreign to the purpose of an integral Yoga; for if we are to realise the Divine in the world, it cannot be done by leaving aside the world-action and action itself altogether. At a less high pitch it was laid down by the religious mind in ancient times that one should keep only such actions as are in their nature part of the seeking, service or cult<span class='page-number' id='s-135' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.135]</span> of the Divine and such others as are attached to these or, in addition, those that are indispensable to the ordinary setting of life but done in a religious spirit and according to the injunctions of traditional religion and Scripture. But this is too formalist a rule for the fulfilment of the free spirit in works, and it is besides professedly no more than a provisional solution for tiding over the transition from life in the world to a life in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beyond</span> which still remains the sole ultimate purpose. An integral Yoga must lean rather to the catholic injunction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> that even the liberated soul, living in the Truth, should still do all the works of life so that the plan of the universal evolution under a secret divine leading may not languish or suffer. But if all works are to be done with the same forms and on the same lines as they are now done in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>, our gain is only inward and our life is in danger of becoming the dubious and ambiguous formula of an inner Light doing the works of an outer Twilight, the perfect Spirit expressing itself in a mould of imperfection foreign to its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>. If no better can be done for a time,—and during a long period of transition something like this does inevitably happen,—then so it must remain till things are ready and the spirit within is powerful enough to impose its own forms on the life of the body and the world outside; but this can be accepted only as a transitional stage and not as our soul's ideal or the ultimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of the passage.\n\nFor the same reason the ethical solution is insufficient; for an ethical rule merely puts a bit in the mouth of the wild horses of Nature and exercises over them a difficult and partial control, but it has no power to transform Nature so that she may move in a secure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> fulfilling the intuitions that proceed from a divine self-knowledge. At best its method is to lay down limits, to coerce the devil, to put the wall of a relative and very doubtful safety around us. This or some similar device of self-protection may be necessary for a time whether in ordinary life or in Yoga; but in Yoga it can only be the mark of a transition. A fundamental transformation and a pure wideness of spiritual life are the aim before us and, if we are to reach it, we must find a deeper solution, a surer supra-ethical dynamic principle. To be spiritual<span class='page-number' id='s-136' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.136]</span> within, ethical in the outside life, this is the ordinary religious solution, but it is a compromise; the spiritualisation of both the inward being and the outward life and not a compromise between life and the spirit is the goal of which we are the seekers. Nor can the human confusion of values which obliterates the distinction between spiritual and moral and even claims that the moral is the only true spiritual element in our nature be of any use to us; for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span> is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental control</span>, and the limited erring mind is not and cannot be the free and ever-luminous spirit. It is equally impossible to accept the gospel that makes life the one aim, takes its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> fundamentally as they are and only calls in a half-spiritual or pseudo-spiritual light to flush and embellish it. Inadequate too is the very frequent attempt at a misalliance between the vital and the spiritual, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic experience</span> within with an aestheticised intellectual and sensuous Paganism or exalted hedonism outside leaning upon it and satisfying itself in the glow of a spiritual sanction; for this too is a precarious and never successful compromise and it is as far from the divine Truth and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span> as the puritanic opposite. These are all stumbling solutions of the fallible human mind groping for a transaction between the high spiritual summits and the lower pitch of the ordinary mind-motives and life-motives. Whatever partial truth may be hidden behind them, that truth can only be accepted when it has been raised to the spiritual level, tested in the supreme Truth-consciousness and extricated from the soil and error of the Ignorance.\n\nIn sum, it may be safely affirmed that no solution offered can be anything but provisional until a Supramental Truth-consciousness is reached by which the appearances of things are put in their place and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> revealed and that in them which derives straight from the spiritual essence. In the meanwhile our only safety is to find a guiding law of spiritual experience—or else to liberate a light within that can lead us on the way until that greater direct Truth-consciousness is reached above us or born within us. For all else in us that is only outward, all that is not a spiritual sense or seeing, the constructions, representations or conclusions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, the suggestions or<span class='page-number' id='s-137' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.137]</span> instigations of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span>, the positive necessities of physical things are sometimes half-lights, sometimes false <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> that can at best only serve for a while or serve a little and for the rest either detain or confuse us. The guiding law of spiritual experience can only come by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of human consciousness to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Consciousness</span>; there must be the power to receive in us the working and command and dynamic presence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> and surrender ourselves to her control; it is that surrender and that control which bring the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. But the surrender is not sure, there is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> certitude of the guidance so long as we are besieged by mind <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> and life impulses and instigations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> which may easily betray us into the hands of a false experience. This danger can only be countered by the opening of a now nine-tenths concealed inmost soul or psychic being that is already there but not commonly active within us. That is the inner light we must liberate; for the light of this inmost soul is our one sure illumination so long as we walk still amidst the siege of the Ignorance and the Truth-consciousness has not taken up the entire control of our Godward endeavour. The working of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Force</span></span> in us under the conditions of the transition and the light of the psychic being turning us always towards a conscious and seeing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to that higher impulsion and away from the demands and instigations of the Forces of the Ignorance, these between them create an ever progressive inner law of our action which continues till the spiritual and supramental can be established in our nature. In the transition there may well be a period in which we take up all life and action and offer them to the Divine for purification, change and deliverance of the truth within them, another period in which we draw back and build a spiritual wall around us admitting through its gates only such activities as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to undergo the law of the spiritual transformation, a third in which a free and all-embracing action, but with new forms fit for the utter truth of the Spirit, can again be made possible. These things, however, will be decided by no mental rule but in the light of the soul within us and by the ordaining force and progressive guidance of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Power</span> that secretly or overtly first impels, then<span class='page-number' id='s-138' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.138]</span> begins clearly to control and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> and finally takes up the whole burden of the Yoga.\n\nIn accordance with the triple character of the sacrifice we may divide works too into a triple order, the works of Knowledge, the works of Love, the works of the Will-in-Life, and see how this more plastic spiritual rule applies to each province and effects the transition from the lower to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher nature</span>.\n\n---\n\nIt is natural from the point of view of the Yoga to divide into two categories the activities of the human mind in its pursuit of knowledge. There is the supreme supra-intellectual knowledge which concentrates itself on the discovery of the One and Infinite in its transcendence or tries to penetrate by intuition, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span>, direct inner contact into the ultimate truths behind the appearances of Nature; there is the lower science which diffuses itself in an outward knowledge of phenomena, the disguises of the One and Infinite as it appears to us in or through the more exterior forms of the world-manifestation around us. These two, an upper and a lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hemisphere</span>, in the form of them constructed or conceived by men within the mind's ignorant limits, have even there separated themselves, as they developed, with some sharpness.... Philosophy, sometimes spiritual or at least intuitive, sometimes abstract and intellectual, sometimes intellectualising spiritual experience or supporting with a logical apparatus the discoveries of the spirit, has claimed always to take the fixation of ultimate Truth as its province. But even when it did not separate itself on rarefied metaphysical heights from the knowledge that belongs to the practical world and the pursuit of ephemeral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, intellectual Philosophy by its habit of abstraction has seldom been a power for life. It has been sometimes powerful for high speculation, pursuing mental Truth for its own sake without any ulterior utility or object, sometimes for a subtle gymnastic of the mind in a mistily bright cloud-land of words and ideas, but it has walked or acrobatised far from the more tangible realities of existence. Ancient<span class='page-number' id='s-139' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.139]</span> Philosophy in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> was more dynamic, but only for the few; in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> in its more spiritualised forms, it strongly influenced but without transforming the life of the race.... Religion did not attempt, like Philosophy, to live alone on the heights; its aim was rather to take hold of man's parts of life even more than his parts of mind and draw them Godwards; it professed to build a bridge between spiritual Truth and the vital and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> human existence; it strove to subordinate and reconcile the lower to the higher, make life serviceable to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, Earth obedient to Heaven. It has to be admitted that too often this necessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> had the opposite result of making Heaven a sanction for Earth's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>; for, continually, the religious idea has been turned into an excuse for the worship and service of the human ego. Religion, leaving constantly its little shining core of spiritual experience, has lost itself in the obscure mass of its ever extending ambiguous compromises with life: in attempting to satisfy the thinking mind, it more often succeeded in oppressing or fettering it with a mass of theological dogmas; while seeking to net the human heart, it fell itself into pits of pietistic emotionalism and sensationalism; in the act of annexing the vital nature of man to dominate it, it grew itself vitiated and fell a prey to all the fanaticism, homicidal fury, savage or harsh turn for oppression, pullulating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span>, obstinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to ignorance to which that vital nature is prone; its desire to draw the physical in man towards God betrayed it into chaining itself to ecclesiastic mechanism, hollow ceremony and lifeless ritual. The corruption of the best produced the worst by that strange chemistry of the power of life which generates <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> even as it can also generate good out of evil. At the same time in a vain effort at self-defence against this downward gravitation, Religion was driven to cut existence into two by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> of knowledge, works, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, life itself into two opposite categories, the spiritual and the worldly, religious and mundane, sacred and profane; but this defensive distinction itself became conventional and artificial and aggravated rather than healed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span>.... On their side Science and Art and the knowledge of Life, although at first they served or lived in the shadow of Religion, ended by emancipating themselves, became<span class='page-number' id='s-140' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.140]</span> estranged or hostile, or have even recoiled with indifference, contempt or scepticism from what seem to them the cold, barren and distant or unsubstantial and illusory heights of unreality to which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphysical Philosophy</span> and Religion aspire. For a time the divorce has been as complete as the one-sided intolerance of the human mind could make it and threatened even to end in a complete extinction of all attempt at a higher or a more spiritual knowledge. Yet even in the earthward life a higher knowledge is indeed the one thing that is throughout needful, and without it the lower sciences and pursuits, however fruitful, however rich, free, miraculous in the abundance of their results, become easily a sacrifice offered without due order and to false <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>; corrupting, hardening in the end the heart of man, limiting his mind's horizons, they confine in a stony material imprisonment or lead to a final baffling incertitude and disillusionment. A sterile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>agnosticism</span> awaits us above the brilliant phosphorescence of a half-knowledge that is still the Ignorance.\n\nA Yoga turned towards an all-embracing realisation of the Supreme will not despise the works or even the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>, if dreams they are, of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cosmic</span> Spirit or shrink from the splendid toil and many-sided victory which he has assigned to himself in the human creature. But its first condition for this liberality is that our works in the world too must be part of the sacrifice offered to the Highest and to none else, to the Divine Shakti and to no other Power, in the right spirit and with the right knowledge, by the free soul and not by the hypnotised bondslave of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span>. If a division of works has to be made, it is between those that are nearest to the heart of the sacred flame and those that are least touched or illumined by it because they are more at a distance, or between the fuel that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>burns</span> strongly and brightly and the logs that if too thickly heaped on the altar may impede the ardour of the fire by their rather damp, heavy and diffused abundance. But, otherwise, apart from this division, all activities of knowledge that seek after or express Truth are in themselves rightful materials for a complete offering; none ought necessarily to be excluded from the wide framework of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine life</span>. The mental and physical sciences which examine into the laws and<span class='page-number' id='s-141' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.141]</span> forms and processes of things, those which concern the life of men and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span>, the social, political, linguistic and historical and those which seek to know and control the labours and activities by which man subdues and utilises his world and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, and the noble and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> Arts which are at once work and knowledge,—for every well-made and significant poem, picture, statue or building is an act of creative knowledge, a living discovery of the consciousness, a figure of Truth, a dynamic form of mental and vital self-expression or world-expression,—all that seeks, all that finds, all that voices or figures is a realisation of something of the play of the Infinite and to that extent can be made a means of God-realisation or of divine formation. But the Yogin has to see that it is no longer done as part of an ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span>; it can be accepted by him only if by the feeling, the remembrance, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dedication</span> within it, it is turned into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of the spiritual consciousness and becomes a part of its vast grasp of comprehensive illuminating knowledge.\n\nFor all must be done as a sacrifice, all activities must have the One Divine for their object and the heart of their meaning. The Yogin's aim in the sciences that make for knowledge should be to discover and understand the workings of the Divine Consciousness-Puissance in man and creatures and things and forces, her creative significances, her execution of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysteries</span>, the symbols in which she arranges the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>. The Yogin's aim in the practical sciences, whether mental and physical or occult and psychic, should be to enter into the ways of the Divine and his processes, to know the materials and means for the work given to us so that we may use that knowledge for a conscious and faultless expression of the spirit's mastery, joy and self-fulfilment. The Yogin's aim in the Arts should not be a mere aesthetic, mental or vital gratification, but, seeing the Divine everywhere, worshipping it with a revelation of the meaning of its own works, to express that One Divine in ideal forms, the One Divine in principles and forces, the One Divine in gods and men and creatures and objects. The theory that sees an intimate connection between religious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and the truest and greatest Art is in essence right; but we must<span class='page-number' id='s-142' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.142]</span> substitute for the mixed and doubtful religious motive a spiritual aspiration, vision, interpreting experience. For the wider and more comprehensive the seeing, the more it contains in itself the sense of the hidden Divine in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> and in all things and rises beyond a superficial religiosity into the spiritual life, the more luminous, flexible, deep and powerful will the Art be that springs from that high motive. The Yogin's distinction from other men is this that he lives in a higher and vaster spiritual consciousness; all his work of knowledge or creation must then spring from there: it must not be made in the mind,—for it is a greater truth and vision than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span>'s that he has to express or rather that presses to express itself through him and mould his works, not for his personal satisfaction, but for a divine purpose.\n\nAt the same time the Yogin who knows the Supreme is not subject to any need or compulsion in these activities; for to him they are neither a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> nor a necessary occupation for the mind nor a high amusement, nor imposed even by the loftiest human purpose. He is not attached, bound and limited by any nor has he any personal motive of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span>, greatness or personal satisfaction in these works; he can leave or pursue them as the Divine in him wills, but he need not otherwise abandon them in his pursuit of the higher integral knowledge. He will do these things just as the supreme Power acts and creates, for a certain spiritual joy in creation and expression or to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> in the holding together and right ordering or leading of this world of God's workings. The Gita teaches that the man of knowledge shall by his way of life give to those who have not yet the spiritual consciousness, the love and habit of *all* works and not only of actions recognised as pious, religious or ascetic in their character; he should not draw men away from the world-action by his example. For the world must proceed in its great upward aspiring; men and nations must not be led to fall away from even an ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> into a worse ignorance of inaction or to sink down into that miserable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> and tendency of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> which comes upon communities and peoples when there predominates the tamasic principle, the principle whether of obscure confusion and error<span class='page-number' id='s-143' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.143]</span> or of weariness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>. \"For I too,\" says the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> in the Gita, \"have no need to do works, since there is nothing I have not or must yet gain for myself; yet I do works in the world: for if I did not do works, all laws would fall into confusion, the worlds would sink towards chaos and I would be the destroyer of these peoples.\" The spiritual life does not need, for its purity, to destroy interest in all things except the Inexpressible or to cut at the roots of the Sciences, the Arts and Life. It may well be one of the effects of an integral spiritual knowledge and activity to lift them out of their limitations, substitute for our mind's ignorant, limited, tepid or trepidant pleasure in them a free, intense and uplifting urge of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and supply a new source of creative spiritual power and illumination by which they can be carried more swiftly and profoundly towards their absolute light in knowledge and their yet undreamed possibilities and most dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of content and form and practice. The one thing needful must be pursued first and always; but all things else come with it as its outcome and have not so much to be added to us as recovered and reshaped in its self-light and as portions of its self-expressive force.\n\n---\n\nThis then is the true relation between divine and human knowledge; it is not a separation into disparate fields, sacred and profane, that is the heart of the difference, but the character of the consciousness behind the working. All is human knowledge that proceeds from the ordinary mental consciousness interested in the outside or upper layers of things, in process, in phenomena for their own sake or for the sake of some surface utility or mental or vital satisfaction of Desire or of the Intelligence. But the same activity of knowledge can become part of the Yoga if it proceeds from the spiritual or spiritualising consciousness which seeks and finds in all that it surveys or penetrates the presence of the timeless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> and the ways of manifestation of the Eternal in Time. It is evident that the need of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> indispensable for the transition out of the Ignorance may make<span class='page-number' id='s-144' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.144]</span> it necessary for the seeker to gather together his energies and focus them only on that which will help the transition and to leave aside or subordinate for the time all that is not directly turned towards the one object. He may find that this or that pursuit of human knowledge with which he was accustomed to deal by the surface power of the mind still brings him by reason of this tendency or habit out of the depths to the surface or down from the heights which he has climbed or is nearing to lower levels. These activities then may have to be intermitted or put aside until, secure in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span>, he is able to turn its powers on all the mental fields; then, subjected to that light or taken up into it, they are turned, by the transformation of his consciousness, into a province of the spiritual and divine. All that cannot be so transformed or refuses to be part of a divine consciousness he will abandon without hesitation, but not from any preconceived prejudgment of its unfitness or its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> to be an element of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span>. There can be no fixed mental test or principle for these things; he will therefore follow no unalterable rule, but accept or repel an activity of the mind according to his feeling, insight or experience until the greater Power and Light are there to turn their unerring scrutiny on all that is below and choose or reject their material out of what the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human evolution</span> has prepared for the divine labour.\n\nHow precisely or by what stages this progression and change will take place must depend on the form, need and powers of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> nature. In the spiritual domain the essence is always one, but there is yet an infinite variety and, at any rate in the integral Yoga, the rigidity of a strict and precise mental rule is seldom applicable; for, even when they walk in the same direction, no two natures proceed on exactly the same lines, in the same series of steps or with quite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> stages of their progress. It may yet be said that a logical succession of the states of progress would be very much in this order. First, there is a large turning in which all the natural mental activities proper to the individual nature are taken up or referred to a higher standpoint and dedicated by the soul in us, the psychic being, the priest of the sacrifice, to the divine service; next, there is an attempt at an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> of the being<span class='page-number' id='s-145' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.145]</span> and a bringing down of the Light and Power proper to some new height of consciousness gained by its upward effort into the whole action of the knowledge. Here there may be a strong concentration on the inward central change of the consciousness and an abandonment of a large part of the outward-going mental life or else its relegation to a small and subordinate place. At different stages it or parts of it may be taken up again from time to time to see how far the new inner psychic and spiritual consciousness can be brought into its movements; but that compulsion of the temperament or the nature which in human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> necessitates one kind of activity or another and makes it seem almost an indispensable portion of the existence, will diminish and eventually no attachment will be left, no lower compulsion or driving force felt anywhere. Only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine will</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, the Divine alone will be the one need of the whole being; if there is any compulsion to activity it will be not that of implanted desire or of force of Nature, but the luminous driving of some greater Consciousness-Force which is becoming more and more the sole motive power of the whole existence. On the other hand, it is possible at any period of the inner spiritual progress that one may experience an extension rather than a restriction of the activities; there may be an opening of new capacities of mental creation and new provinces of knowledge by the miraculous touch of the Yoga-Shakti. Aesthetic feeling, the power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>artistic creation</span> in one field or many fields together, talent or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of literary expression, a faculty of metaphysical thinking, any power of eye or ear or hand or mind-power may awaken where none was apparent before. The Divine within may throw these latent riches out from the depths in which they were hidden or a Force from above may pour down its energies to equip the instrumental nature for the activity or the creation of which it is meant to be a channel or a builder. But, whatever may be the method or the course of development chosen by the hidden Master of the Yoga, the common culmination of this stage is the growing consciousness of him alone as the mover, decider, shaper of all the movements of the mind and all the activities of knowledge.<span class='page-number' id='s-146' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.146]</span>\n\nThere are two signs of the transformation of the seeker's mind of knowledge and works of knowledge from the process of the Ignorance to the process of a liberated consciousness working partly, then wholly in the light of the Spirit. There is first a central change of the consciousness and a growing direct experience, vision, feeling of the Supreme and the cosmic existence, the Divine in itself and the Divine in all things; the mind will be taken up into a growing preoccupation with this first and foremost and will feel itself heightening, widening into a more and more illumined means of expression of the one fundamental knowledge. But also the central Consciousness in its turn will take up more and more the outer mental activities of knowledge and turn them into a parcel of itself or an annexed province; it will infuse into them its more authentic movement and make a more and more spiritualised and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illumined mind</span> its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> in these surface fields, its new conquests, as well as in its own deeper spiritual empire. And this will be the second sign, the sign of a certain completion and perfection, that the Divine himself has become the Knower and all the inner movements, including the activities of what was once a purely human mental action, have become his field of knowledge. There will be less and less individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>, opinion, preference, less and less of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectualisation</span>, mental weaving, cerebral galley-slave labour; a Light within will see all that has to be seen, know all that has to be known, develop, create, organise. It will be the Inner Knower who will do in the liberated and universalised mind of the individual the works of an all-comprehending knowledge.\n\nThese two changes are the signs of a first effectuation in which the activities of the mental nature are lifted up, spiritualised, widened, universalised, liberated, led to a consciousness of their true purpose as an instrumentation of the Divine creating and developing its manifestation in the temporal universe. But this cannot be the whole scope of the transformation; for it is not in these limits that the integral seeker can cease from his ascension or confine the widening of his nature. For, if it were so, knowledge would still remain a working of the mind, liberated, universalised, spiritualised, but still, as all mind must be,<span class='page-number' id='s-147' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.147]</span> comparatively restricted, relative, imperfect in the very essence of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dynamism</span>; it would reflect luminously great constructions of Truth, but not move in the domain where Truth is authentic, direct, sovereign and native. There is an ascension still to be made from this height, by which the spiritualised mind will exceed itself and transmute into a supramental power of knowledge. Already in the process of spiritualisation it will have begun to pass out of the brilliant poverty of the human intellect; it will mount successively into the pure broad reaches of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher mind</span>, and next into the gleaming belts of a still greater free Intelligence illumined with a Light from above. At this point it will begin to feel more freely, admit with a less mixed response the radiant beginnings of an Intuition, not illumined, but luminous in itself, true in itself, no longer entirely mental and therefore subjected to the abundant intrusion of error. Here too is not an end, for it must rise beyond into the very domain of that untruncated Intuition, the first direct light from the self-awareness of essential Being and, beyond it, attain that from which this light comes. For there is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Overmind</span> behind Mind, a Power more original and dynamic which supports Mind, sees it as a diminished radiation from itself, uses it as a transmitting belt of passage downward or an instrument for the creations of the Ignorance. The last step of the ascension would be the surpassing of Overmind itself or its return into its own still greater origin, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> into the supramental light of the Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gnosis</span>. For there in the supramental Light is the seat of a divine Truth-consciousness that has native in it, as no other consciousness below it can have, the power to organise the works of a Truth which is no longer tarnished by the shadow of the cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Inconscience</span> and Ignorance. There to reach and thence to bring down a supramental dynamism that can transform the Ignorance is the distant but imperative supreme goal of the integral Yoga.\n\nAs the light of each of these higher powers is turned upon the human activities of knowledge, any distinction of sacred and profane, human and divine, begins more and more to fade until it is finally abolished as otiose; for whatever is touched and thoroughly penetrated by the Divine Gnosis is transfigured<span class='page-number' id='s-148' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.148]</span> and becomes a movement of its own Light and Power, free from the turbidity and limitations of the lower intelligence. It is not a separation of some activities, but a transformation of them all by the change of the informing consciousness that is the way of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, an ascent of the sacrifice of knowledge to a greater and ever greater light and force. All the works of mind and intellect must be first heightened and widened, then illumined, lifted into the domain of a higher Intelligence, afterwards translated into workings of a greater non-mental Intuition, these again transformed into the dynamic outpourings of the Overmind radiance, and those transfigured into the full light and sovereignty of the supramental Gnosis. It is this that the evolution of consciousness in the world carries prefigured but latent in its seed and in the straining tense intention of its process; nor can that process, that evolution cease till it has evolved the instruments of a perfect in place of its now imperfect manifestation of the Spirit.\n\n---\n\nIf knowledge is the widest power of the consciousness and its function is to free and illumine, yet love is the deepest and most intense and its privilege is to be the key to the most profound and secret recesses of the Divine Mystery. Man, because he is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>, is prone to give the highest importance to the thinking mind and its reason and will and to its way of approach and effectuation of Truth and, even, he is inclined to hold that there is no other. The heart with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and incalculable movements is to the eye of his intellect an obscure, uncertain and often a perilous and misleading power which needs to be kept in control by the reason and the mental will and intelligence. And yet there is in the heart or behind it a profounder mystic light which, if not what we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> intuition,—for that, though not of the mind, yet descends through the mind—has yet a direct touch upon Truth and is nearer to the Divine than the human intellect in its pride of knowledge. According to the ancient teaching the seat of the immanent Divine, the hidden Purusha, is in the mystic heart,—the secret heart-cave, *hṛdaye guhāyām*,<span class='page-number' id='s-149' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.149]</span> as the Upanishads put it,—and, according to the experience of many Yogins, it is from its depths that there comes the voice or the breath of the inner oracle.\n\nThis ambiguity, these opposing appearances of depth and blindness are created by the double character of the human emotive being. For there is in front in man a heart of vital emotion similar to the animal's, if more variously developed; its emotions are governed by egoistic passion, blind instinctive affections and all the play of the life-impulses with their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imperfections</span>, perversions, often sordid degradations,—heart besieged and given over to the lusts, desires, wraths, intense or fierce demands or little greeds and mean pettinesses of an obscure and fallen life-force and debased by its slavery to any and every impulse. This mixture of the emotive heart and the sensational hungering vital creates in man a false soul of desire; it is this that is the crude and dangerous element which the reason rightly distrusts and feels a need to control, even though the actual control or rather coercion it succeeds in establishing over our raw and insistent vital nature remains always very uncertain and deceptive. But the true soul of man is not there; it is in the true invisible heart hidden in some luminous cave of the nature: there under some infiltration of the divine Light is our soul, a silent inmost being of which few are even aware; for if all have a soul, few are conscious of their true soul or feel its direct impulse. There dwells the little spark of the Divine which supports the obscure mass of our nature and around it grows the psychic being, the formed soul or the real Man within us. It is as this psychic being in him grows and the movements of the heart reflect its divinations and impulsions that man becomes more and more aware of his soul, ceases to be a superior animal and, awakening to glimpses of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> within him, admits more and more its intimations of a deeper life and consciousness and an impulse towards things divine. It is one of the decisive moments of the integral Yoga when this psychic being, liberated, brought out from the veil to the front, can pour the full flood of its divinations, seeings and impulsions on the mind, life and body of man and begins to prepare the upbuilding of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> in the earthly nature.<span class='page-number' id='s-150' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.150]</span>\n\nAs in the works of knowledge, so in dealing with the workings of the heart, we are obliged to make a preliminary distinction between two categories of movements, those that are either moved by the true soul or aid towards its liberation and rule in the nature and those that are turned to the satisfaction of the unpurified vital nature. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> ordinarily laid down in this sense are of little use for the deeper spiritual purpose of Yoga. Thus a division can be made between religious emotions and mundane <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and it can be laid down as a rule of spiritual life that the religious emotions alone should be cultivated and all worldly feelings and passions must be rejected and fall away from our existence. This in practice would mean the religious life of the saint or devotee, alone within with the Divine or linked only to others in a common God-love or at the most pouring out the fountains of a sacred, religious or pietistic love on the world outside. But religious emotion itself is too constantly invaded by the turmoil and obscurity of the vital movements and it is often either crude or narrow or fanatical or mixed with movements that are not signs of the spirit's perfection. It is evident besides that even at the best an intense figure of sainthood clamped in rigid hieratic lines is quite other than the wide ideal of an integral Yoga. A larger psychic and emotional relation with God and the world, more deep and plastic in its essence, more wide and embracing in its movements, more capable of taking up in its sweep the whole of life, is imperative.\n\nA wider formula has been provided by the secular mind of man of which the basis is the ethical sense; for it distinguishes between the emotions sanctioned by the ethical sense and those that are egoistic and selfishly common and mundane. It is the works of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>altruism</span>, philanthropy, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span>, benevolence, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanitarianism</span>, service, labour for the well-being of man and all creatures that are to be our ideal; to shuffle off the coil of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> and grow into a soul of self-abnegation that lives only or mainly for others or for humanity as a whole is the way of man's inner evolution according to this doctrine. Or if this is too secular and mental to satisfy the whole of our being, since there is a deeper religious and spiritual note there that is left<span class='page-number' id='s-151' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.151]</span> out of account by the humanitarian formula, a religio-ethical foundation can be provided for it—and such was indeed its original basis. To the inner worship of the Divine or the Supreme by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> of the heart or to the pursuit of the Ineffable by the seeking of a highest knowledge can be added a worship through altruistic works or a preparation through acts of love, of benevolence, of service to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> or to those around us. It is indeed by the religio-ethical sense that the law of universal goodwill or universal compassion or of love and service to the neighbour, the Vedantic, the Buddhistic, the Christian ideal, was created; only by a sort of secular refrigeration extinguishing the fervour of the religious element in it could the humanitarian ideal disengage itself and become the highest plane of a secular system of mental and moral ethics. For in the religious system this law of works is a means that ceases when its object is accomplished or a side issue; it is a part of the cult by which one adores and seeks the Divinity or it is a penultimate step of the excision of self in the passage to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. In the secular ideal it is promoted into an object in itself; it becomes a sign of the moral perfection of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>, or else it is a condition for a happier state of man upon earth, a better society, a more united life of the race. But none of these things satisfy the demand of the soul that is placed before us by the integral Yoga.\n\nAltruism, philanthropy, humanitarianism, service are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span> of the mental consciousness and are at best the mind's cold and pale imitation of the spiritual flame of universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Love</span>. Not truly liberative from ego-sense, they widen it at most and give it a higher and larger satisfaction; impotent in practice to change man's vital life and nature, they only modify and palliate its action and daub over its unchanged egoistic essence. Or if they are intensely followed with an entire sincerity of the will, it is by an exaggerated amplification of one side of our nature; in that exaggeration there can be no clue for the full and perfect divine evolution of the many sides of our individualised being towards the universal and transcendent Eternal. Nor can the religio-ethical ideal be a sufficient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span>,—for this is a compromise or compact of mutual concessions for mutual<span class='page-number' id='s-152' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.152]</span> support between a religious urge which seeks to get a closer hold on earth by taking into itself the higher turns of ordinary human nature and an ethical urge which hopes to elevate itself out of its own mental hardness and dryness by some touch of a religious fervour. In making this compact religion lowers itself to the mental level and inherits the inherent imperfections of mind and its inability to convert and transform life. The mind is the sphere of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span> and, just as it is impossible for it to achieve any absolute Truth but only truths relative or mixed with error, so it is impossible for it to achieve any absolute good; for moral good exists as a counterpart and corrective to evil and has evil always for its shadow, complement, almost its reason for existence. But the spiritual consciousness belongs to a higher than the mental plane and there the dualities cease; for there falsehood confronted with the truth by which it profited through a usurping falsification of it and evil faced by the good of which it was a perversion or a lurid substitute, are obliged to perish for want of sustenance and to cease. The integral Yoga, refusing to rely upon the fragile stuff of mental and moral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, puts its whole emphasis in this field on three central dynamic processes—the development of the true soul or psychic being to take the place of the false soul of desire, the sublimation of human into divine love, the elevation of consciousness from its mental to its spiritual and Supramental plane by whose power alone both the soul and the life-force can be utterly delivered from the veils and prevarications of the Ignorance.\n\nIt is the very nature of the soul or the psychic being to turn towards the divine Truth as the sunflower to the sun; it accepts and clings to all that is divine or progressing towards divinity, and draws back from all that is a perversion or a denial of it, from all that is false and undivine. Yet the soul is at first but a spark and then a little flame of godhead burning in the midst of a great darkness; for the most part it is veiled in its inner sanctum and to reveal itself it has to call on the mind, the life-force and the physical consciousness and persuade them, as best they can, to express it; ordinarily, it succeeds at most in suffusing their outwardness with its inner light and modifying with its<span class='page-number' id='s-153' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.153]</span> purifying fineness their dark obscurities or their coarser mixture. Even when there is a formed psychic being able to express itself with some directness in life, it is still in all but a few a smaller portion of the being—\"no bigger in the mass of the body than the thumb of a man\" was the image used by the ancient seers—and it is not always able to prevail against the obscurity or ignorant smallness of the physical consciousness, the mistaken surenesses of the mind or the arrogance and vehemence of the vital nature. This soul is obliged to accept the human mental, emotive, sensational life as it is, its relations, its activities, its cherished forms and figures; it has to labour to disengage and increase the divine element in all this relative truth mixed with a continual falsifying error, this love turned to the uses of the animal body or the satisfaction of the vital ego, this life of an average manhood shot with rare and pale glimpses of godhead and the darker luridities of the demon and the brute. Unerring in the essence of its will, it is obliged often under the pressure of its instruments to submit to mistakes of action, wrong placement of feeling, wrong choice of person, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> in the exact form of its will, in the circumstances of its expression of the infallible inner ideal. Yet is there a divination within it which makes it a surer guide than the reason or than even the highest desire, and through apparent errors and stumblings its voice can still lead better than the precise intellect and the considering mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span>. This voice of the soul is not what we call <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>—for that is only a mental and often conventional erring substitute; It is a deeper and more seldom heard call; yet to follow it when heard is wisest: even, it is better to wander at the call of one's soul than to go apparently straight with the reason and the outward moral mentor. But it is only when the life turns towards the Divine that the soul can truly come forward and impose its power on the outer members; for, itself a spark of the Divine, to grow in flame towards the Divine is its true life and its very reason of existence.\n\nAt a certain stage in the Yoga when the mind is sufficiently quieted and no longer supports itself at every step on the sufficiency of its mental certitudes, when the vital has been steadied<span class='page-number' id='s-154' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.154]</span> and subdued and is no longer constantly insistent on its own rash will, demand and desire, when the physical has been sufficiently altered not to bury altogether the inner flame under the mass of its outwardness, obscurity or inertia, an inmost being, long hidden within and felt only in its rare influences, is able to come forward and illumine the rest and take up the lead of the Sadhana. Its character is a one-pointed orientation towards the Divine or the Highest, one-pointed and yet plastic in action and movement; it does not create a rigidity of direction like the one-pointed intellect or a bigotry of the regnant idea or impulse like the one-pointed vital force; it is at every moment and with a supple sureness that it points the way to the Truth, automatically distinguishes the right step from the false, extricates the divine or Godward movement from the clinging mixture of the undivine. Its action is like a searchlight showing up all that has to be changed in the nature; it has in it a flame of will insistent on perfection, on an alchemic transmutation of all the inner and outer existence. It sees the divine essence everywhere but rejects the mere mask and the disguising figure. It insists on Truth, on will and strength and mastery, on Joy and Love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beauty</span>, but on a Truth of abiding Knowledge that surpasses the mere practical momentary truth of the Ignorance, on an inward joy and not on mere vital pleasure,—for it prefers rather a purifying suffering and sorrow to degrading satisfactions,—on love winged upward and not tied to the stake of egoistic craving or with its feet sunk in the mire, on beauty restored to its priesthood of interpretation of the Eternal, on strength and will and mastery as instruments not of the ego but of the Spirit. Its will is for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinisation</span> of life, the expression through it of a higher Truth, its dedication to the Divine and the Eternal.\n\nBut the most intimate character of the psychic is its pressure towards the Divine through a sacred love, joy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. It is a divine Love that it seeks most, it is the love of the Divine that is its spur, its goal, its star of Truth shining over the luminous cave of the nascent or the still obscure cradle of the new-born godhead within us. In the first long stage of its growth and immature existence it has leaned on earthly love, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span>,<span class='page-number' id='s-155' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.155]</span> tenderness, goodwill, compassion, benevolence, on all beauty and gentleness and fineness and light and strength and courage, on all that can help to refine and purify the grossness and commonness of human nature; but it knows how mixed are these human movements at their best and at their worst how fallen and stamped with the mark of ego and self-deceptive sentimental falsehood and the lower self profiting by the imitation of a soul-movement. At once, emerging, it is ready and eager to break all the old ties and imperfect emotional activities and replace them by a greater spiritual Truth of love and oneness. It may still admit the human forms and movements, but on condition that they are turned towards the One alone. It accepts only the ties that are helpful, the heart's and mind's reverence for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guru</span>, the union of the God-seekers, a spiritual compassion for this ignorant human and animal world and its peoples, the joy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> and satisfaction of beauty that comes from the perception of the Divine everywhere. It plunges the nature inward towards its meeting with the immanent Divine in the heart's secret centre and, while that call is there, no reproach of egoism, no mere outward summons of altruism or duty or philanthropy or service will deceive or divert it from its sacred longing and its obedience to the attraction of the Divinity within it. It lifts the being towards a transcendent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ecstasy</span> and is ready to shed all the downward pull of the world from its wings in its uprising to reach the One Highest; but it calls down also this transcendent Love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beatitude</span> to deliver and transform this world of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span> and strife and division and darkness and jarring Ignorance. It opens to a universal Divine Love, a vast compassion, an intense and immense will for the good of all, for the embrace of the World-Mother enveloping or gathering to her her children, the divine Passion that has plunged into the night for the redemption of the world from the universal Inconscience. It is not attracted or misled by mental imitations or any vital misuse of these great deep-seated Truths of existence; it exposes them with its detecting search-ray and calls down the entire truth of divine Love to heal these malformations, to deliver mental, vital, physical love from their insufficiencies or<span class='page-number' id='s-156' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.156]</span> their perversions and reveal to them their true abounding share of the intimacy and the oneness, the ascending ecstasy and the descending rapture.\n\nAll true Truth of love and of the works of love the psychic being accepts in their place: but its flame mounts always upward and it is eager to push the ascent from lesser to higher degrees of Truth, since it knows that only by the ascent to a highest Truth and the descent of that highest Truth can Love be delivered from the cross and placed upon the throne; for the cross is the sign of the Divine Descent barred and marred by the transversal line of a cosmic deformation which turns it into a stake of suffering and misfortune. Only by the ascent to the original Truth can the deformation be healed and all the works of love, as too all the works of knowledge and of life, be restored to a divine significance and become part of an integral spiritual existence.<span class='page-number' id='s-157' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.157]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - II","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-ii","prvt":"The Sacrifice, the Triune Path and the Lord of the Sacrifice","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-sacrifice-the-triune-path-and-the-lord-of-the-sacrifice","subt":"The Works of Knowledge - The Psychic Being","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-ii"],"t":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - II","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"It is therefore through the sacrifice of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, works and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> with the psychic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> as the leader and priest of the sacrifice that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> itself can be transformed into its own true spiritual figure.

Certain idolatries are indispensable for the development of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional being</span>, nor will the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who knows be hasty at any time to shatter the image unless he can replace it in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the worshipper by the Reality it figures. Moreover, they have this power because there is always something in them that is greater than their forms and, even when we reach the supreme worship, that abides and becomes a prolongation of it or a part of its catholic wholeness. Our knowledge is still imperfect in us, love incomplete if even when we know That which surpasses all forms and manifestations, we cannot still accept the Divine in creature and object, in man, in the kind, in the animal, in the tree, in the flower, in the work of our hands, in the Nature-Force which is then no longer to us the blind <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> but a face and power of the universal Shakti: for in these things too is the presence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>.\n\nAn ultimate inexpressible adoration offered by us to the<span class='page-number' id='s-159' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.159]</span> Transcendent, to the Highest,[^1] to the Ineffable, is yet no complete worship if it is not offered to him wherever he manifests or wherever even he hides his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span>—in man[^2] and object and every creature. An Ignorance is there no doubt which imprisons the heart, distorts its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, obscures the significance of its offering; all partial worship, all religion which erects a mental or a physical idol is tempted to veil and protect the truth in it by a certain cloak of ignorance and easily loses the truth in its image. But the pride of exclusive knowledge is also a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and a barrier. For there is, concealed behind individual love, obscured by its ignorant human figure, a mystery which the mind cannot seize, the mystery of the body of the Divine, the secret of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> form of the Infinite which we can approach only through the ecstasy of the heart and the passion of the pure and sublimated sense, and its attraction which is the call of the divine Flute-player, the mastering compulsion of the All-Beautiful, can only be seized and seize us through an occult love and yearning which in the end makes one the Form and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Formless</span>, and identifies Spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span>. It is that which the spirit in Love is seeking here in the darkness of the Ignorance and it is that which it finds when individual human love is changed into the love of the Immanent Divine incarnate in the material universe.\n\n[^1]: *paraṁ bhāvam.*\n\n[^2]: *mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam.*\n\nAs with individual, so with universal Love; all that widening of the self through sympathy, goodwill, universal benevolence and beneficence, love of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>, love of creatures, the attraction of all the myriad forms and presences that surround us, by which mentally and emotionally man escapes from the first limits of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, has to be taken up into a unifying divine love for the universal Divine. Adoration fulfilled in love, love in Ananda,—the surpassing love, the self-wrapped ecstasy of transcendent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in the Transcendent which awaits us at the end of the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span>,—has for its wider result a universal love for all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, the Ananda of all that is; we perceive behind every veil the Divine, spiritually embrace in all forms the All-Beautiful. A<span class='page-number' id='s-160' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.160]</span> universal delight in his endless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> flows through us, taking in its surge every form and movement, but not bound or stationary in any and always reaching out to a greater and more perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. This universal love is liberative and dynamic or transformation; for the discord of forms and appearances ceases to affect the heart that has felt the one Truth behind them all and understood their perfect significance. The impartial equality of soul of the selfless worker and knower is transformed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> touch of divine Love into an all-embracing ecstasy and million-bodied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span>. All things become bodies and all movements the playings of the divine Beloved in his infinite house of pleasure. Even pain is changed and in their reaction and even in their essence things painful alter; the forms of pain fall away, there are created in their place the forms of Ananda.\n\nThis is in its essence the nature of the change of consciousness which turns existence itself into a glorified field of a Divine Love and Ananda. In its essence it begins for the seeker when he passes from the ordinary to the spiritual level and looks with a new heart of luminous vision and feeling on the world and self and others. It reaches its height when the spiritual becomes also the supramental level and then also it is possible not only to feel it in essence but realise it dynamically as a Power for the transformation of the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and the whole outer existence.\n\n---\n\nIt is not altogether difficult for the mind to envisage, even though it may be difficult for the human will with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> earth-ties to accept, this transformation of the spirit and nature of love from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of a mixed and limited human emotion to a supreme and all-embracing divine passion. It is when we come to the works of love that a certain perplexity is likely to intervene. It is possible, as in a certain high exaggeration of the path of knowledge, to cut here also the knot of the problem, escape the difficulty of uniting the spirit of love with the crudities of the world-action by avoiding it; it is open to us, withdrawing<span class='page-number' id='s-161' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.161]</span> from outward life and action altogether, to live alone with our adoration of the Divine in the heart's silence. It is possible too to admit only those acts that are either in themselves an expression of love for the Divine, prayer, praise, symbolic acts of worship or subordinate activities that may be attached to these things and partake of their spirit, and to leave aside all else; the soul turns away to satisfy its inner longing in the absorbed or the God-centred life of the saint and devotee. It is possible, again, to open the doors of life more largely and to spend one's love of the Divine in acts of service to those around us and to the race; one can do the works of philanthropy, benevolence and beneficence, charity and succour to man and beast and every creature, transfigure them by a kind of spiritual passion, at least bring into their merely ethical appearance the greater power of a spiritual motive. This is indeed the solution most commonly favoured by the religious mind of today and we see it confidently advanced on all sides as the proper field of action of the God-seeker or of the man whose life is founded on divine love and knowledge. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> pushed towards a complete union of the Divine with the earth-life cannot stop short in this narrow province or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> this union within the lesser dimensions of an ethical rule of philanthropy and beneficence. All action must be made in it part of the God-life, our acts of knowledge, our acts of power and production and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, our acts of joy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and the soul's pleasure, our acts of will and endeavour and struggle and not our acts only of love and beneficent service. Its way to do these things will be not outward and mental, but inward and spiritual, and to that end it will bring into all activities, whatever they are, the spirit of divine love, the spirit of adoration and worship, the spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> in the Divine and in the beauty of the Divine so as to make all life a sacrifice of the works of the soul's love to the Divine, its cult of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of its existence.\n\nIt is possible so to turn life into an act of adoration to the Supreme by the spirit in one's works; for, says the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, \"He who gives to me with a heart of adoration a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a cup of water, I take and enjoy that offering of his devotion\"; and<span class='page-number' id='s-162' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.162]</span> it is not only any dedicated external gift that can be so offered with love and devotion, but all our thoughts, all our feelings and sensations, all our outward activities and their forms and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> can be such gifts to the Eternal. It is true that the special act or form of action has its importance, even a great importance, but it is the spirit in the act that is the essential factor; the spirit of which it is the symbol or materialised expression gives it its whole value and justifying significance. Or it may be said that a complete act of divine love and worship has in it three parts that are the expressions of a single whole,—a practical worship of the Divine in the act, a symbol of worship in the form of the act expressing some vision and seeking or some relation with the Divine, an inner adoration and longing for oneness or feeling of oneness in the heart and soul and spirit. It is so that life can be changed into worship,—by putting behind it the spirit of a transcendent and universal love, the seeking of oneness, the sense of oneness; by making each act a symbol, an expression of Godward emotion or a relation with the Divine; by turning all we do into an act of worship, an act of the soul's communion, the mind's understanding, the life's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span>, the heart's surrender.\n\nIn any cult the symbol, the significant rite or expressive figure is not only a moving and enriching aesthetic element, but a physical means by which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> begins to make outwardly definite the emotion and aspiration of his heart, to confirm it and to dynamise it. For if without a spiritual aspiration worship is meaningless and vain, yet the aspiration also without the act and the form is a disembodied and, for life, an incompletely effective power. It is unhappily the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of all forms in human life to become crystallised, purely formal and therefore effete, and although form and cult preserve always their power for the man who can still enter into their meaning, the majority come to use the ceremony as a mechanical rite and the symbol as a lifeless sign, and because that kills the soul of religion, cult and form have in the end to be changed or thrown aside altogether. There are those even to whom all cult and form are for this reason suspect and offensive; but few can dispense with the support of outward symbols and, even, a certain divine element<span class='page-number' id='s-163' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.163]</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span> demands them always for the completeness of its spiritual satisfaction. Always the symbol is legitimate in so far as it is true, sincere, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and delightful, and even one may say that a spiritual consciousness without any aesthetic or emotional content is not entirely or at any rate not integrally spiritual. In the spiritual life the basis of the act is a spiritual consciousness perennial and renovating, moved to express itself always in new forms or able to renew the truth of a form always by the flow of the spirit, and to so express itself and make every action a living symbol of some truth of the soul is the very nature of its creative vision and impulse. It is so that the spiritual seeker must deal with life and transmute its form and glorify it in its essence.\n\nA supreme divine Love is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative Power</span> and, even though it can exist in itself silent and unchangeable, yet rejoices in external form and expression and is not condemned to be a speechless and bodiless godhead. It has even been said that creation itself was an act of love or at least the building up of a field in which Divine Love could devise its symbols and fulfil itself in act of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mutuality</span> and self-giving, and, if not the initial nature of creation, this may well be its ultimate object and motive. It does not so appear now because, even if a Divine Love is there in the world upholding all this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of creatures, yet the stuff of life and its action is made up of an egoistic formation, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>, a struggle of life and consciousness to exist and survive in an apparently indifferent, inclement or even hostile world of inanimate and inconscient Matter. In the confusion and obscurity of this struggle all are thrown against each other with a will in each to assert its own existence first and foremost and only secondarily to assert itself in others and very partially for others; for even man's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>altruism</span> remains essentially egoistic and must be so till the soul finds the secret of the divine Oneness. It is to discover that at its supreme source, to bring it from within and to radiate it out up to the extreme confines of life that is turned the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of the Yoga. All action, all creation must be turned into a form, a symbol of the cult, the adoration, the sacrifice; it must carry something that makes it bear in it<span class='page-number' id='s-164' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.164]</span> the stamp of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dedication</span>, a reception and translation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Consciousness</span>, a service of the Beloved, a self-giving, a surrender. This has to be done wherever possible in the outward body and form of the act; it must be done always in its inward emotion and an intensity that shows it to be an outflow from the soul towards the Eternal.\n\nIn itself the adoration in the act is a great and complete and powerful sacrifice that tends by its self-multiplication to reach the discovery of the One and make the radiation of the Divine possible. For devotion by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> in acts not only makes its own way broad and full and dynamic, but brings at once into the harder way of works in the world the divinely passionate element of joy and love which is often absent in its beginning when it is only the austere spiritual Will that follows in a struggling uplifting tension the steep <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span>, and the heart is still asleep or bound to silence. If the spirit of divine love can enter, the hardness of the way diminishes, the tension is lightened, there is a sweetness and joy even in the core of difficulty and struggle. The indispensable surrender of all our will and works and activities to the Supreme is indeed only perfect and perfectly effective when it is a surrender of love. All life turned into this cult, all actions done in the love of the Divine and in the love of the world and its creatures seen and felt as the Divine manifested in many disguises become by that very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> part of an integral Yoga.\n\nIt is the inner offering of the heart's adoration, the soul of it in the symbol, the spirit of it in the act, that is the very life of the sacrifice. If this offering is to be complete and universal, then a turning of all our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> to the Divine is imperative. This is the intensest way of purification for the human heart, more powerful than any ethical or aesthetic catharsis could ever be by its half-power and superficial pressure. A psychic fire within must be lit into which all is thrown with the Divine Name upon it. In that fire all the emotions are compelled to cast off their grosser elements and those that are undivine perversions are burned away and the others discard their insufficiencies, till a spirit of largest love and a stainless divine delight arises out of the<span class='page-number' id='s-165' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.165]</span> flame and smoke and frankincense. It is the divine love which so emerges that, extended in inward feeling to the Divine in man and all creatures in an active universal equality, will be more potent for the perfectibility of life and a more real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> than the ineffective mental ideal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span> can ever be. It is this poured out into acts that could alone create a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> in the world and a true unity between all its creatures; all else strives in vain towards that end so long as Divine Love has not disclosed itself as the heart of the delivered manifestation in terrestrial Nature.\n\nIt is here that the emergence of the secret psychic being in us as the leader of the sacrifice is of the utmost importance; for this inmost being alone can bring with it the full power of the spirit in the act, the soul in the symbol. It alone can assure, even while the spiritual consciousness is incomplete, the perennial freshness and sincerity and beauty of the symbol and prevent it from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> a dead form or a corrupted and corrupting magic; it alone can preserve for the act its power with its significance. All the other members of our being, mind, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span>, physical or body consciousness are too much under the control of the Ignorance to be a sure instrumentation and much less can they be a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> or the source of an unerring impulse. Always the greater part of the motive and action of these powers clings to the old law, the deceiving tablets, the cherished inferior movements of Nature and they meet with reluctance, alarm or revolt or obstructing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> the voices and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> that call and impel us to exceed and transform ourselves into a greater being and a wider Nature. In their major part the response is either a resistance or a qualified or temporising acquiescence; for even if they follow the call, they yet tend—when not consciously, then by automatic habit—to bring into the spiritual action their own natural disabilities and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span>. At every moment they are moved to take egoistic advantage of the psychic and spiritual influences and can be detected using the power, joy or light these bring into us for a lower life-motive. Afterwards too, even when the seeker has opened to the Divine Love transcendental, universal or immanent, yet if he tries to pour it into life, he meets the<span class='page-number' id='s-166' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.166]</span> power of obscuration and perversion of these lower Nature-forces. Always they draw away towards pitfalls, pour into that higher intensity their diminishing elements, seek to capture the descending Power for themselves and their interests and degrade it into an aggrandised mental, vital or physical instrumentation for desire and ego. Instead of a Divine Love creator of a new heaven and a new earth of Truth and Light, they would hold it here prisoner as a tremendous sanction and glorifying force of sublimation to gild the mud of the old earth and colour with its rose and sapphire the old turbid unreal skies of sentimentalising vital imagination and mental idealised chimera. If that falsification is permitted, the higher Light and Power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> withdraw, there is a fall back to a lower status; or else the realisation remains tied to an insecure half-way and mixture or is covered and even submerged by an inferior exaltation that is not the true Ananda. It is for this reason that Divine Love which is at the heart of all creation and the most powerful of all redeeming and creative forces has yet been the least frontally present in earthly life, the least successfully redemptive, the least creative. Human nature has been unable to bear it in its purity for the very reason that it is the most powerful, pure, rare and intense of all the divine energies; what little could be seized has been corrupted at once into a vital pietistic ardour, a defenceless religious or ethical sentimentalism, a sensuous or even sensual erotic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span> of the roseate coloured mind or passionately turbid life-impulse and with these simulations compensated its inability to house the Mystic Flame that could rebuild the world with its tongues of sacrifice. It is only the inmost psychic being unveiled and emerging in its full power that can lead the pilgrim sacrifice unscathed through these ambushes and pitfalls; at each moment it catches, exposes, repels the mind's and the life's falsehoods, seizes hold on the truth of the Divine Love and Ananda and separates it from the excitement of the mind's ardours and the blind enthusiasms of the misleading life-force. But all things that are true at their core in mind and life and the physical being it extricates and takes with it in the journey till they stand on the heights, new in spirit and sublime in figure.<span class='page-number' id='s-167' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.167]</span>\n\nAnd yet even the leading of the inmost psychic being is not found sufficient until it has succeeded in raising itself out of this mass of inferior Nature to the highest spiritual levels and the divine spark and flame descended here have rejoined themselves to their original fiery <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ether</span>. For there is there no longer a spiritual consciousness still imperfect and half lost to itself in the thick sheaths of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>, but the full spiritual consciousness in its purity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and intense wideness. There, as it is the eternal Knower that becomes the Knower in us and mover and user of all knowledge, so it is the eternal All-Blissful who is the Adored attracting to himself the eternal divine portion of his being and joy that has gone out into the play of the universe, the infinite Lover pouring himself out in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> of his own manifested selves in a happy Oneness. All Beauty in the world is there the beauty of the Beloved, and all forms of beauty have to stand under the light of that eternal Beauty and submit themselves to the sublimating and transfiguring power of the unveiled Divine Perfection. All Bliss and Joy are there of the All-Blissful, and all inferior forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span>, happiness or pleasure are subjected to the shock of the intensity of its floods or currents and either they are broken to pieces as inadequate things under its convicting stress or compelled to transmute themselves into the forms of the Divine Ananda. Thus for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual consciousness</span> a Force is manifested which can deal sovereignly in it with the diminutions and degradations of the values of the Ignorance. At last it begins to be possible to bring down into life the immense reality and intense concreteness of the love and joy that are of the Eternal. Or at any rate it will be possible for our spiritual consciousness to raise itself out of mind into the supramental Light and Force and Vastness; there in the light and potency of the supramental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gnosis</span> are the splendour and joy of a power of divine self-expression and self-organisation which could rescue and re-create even the world of the Ignorance into a figure of the Truth of the Spirit.\n\nThere in the supramental Gnosis is the fulfilment, the culminating height, the all-embracing extent of the inner adoration, the profound and integral union, the flaming wings of Love<span class='page-number' id='s-168' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.168]</span> upbearing the power and joy of a supreme Knowledge. For supramental Love brings an active ecstasy that surpasses the void passive peace and stillness which is the heaven of the liberated Mind and does not betray the deeper greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> which is the beginning of the supramental silence. The unity of a love which is able to include in itself all differences without being diminished or abrogated by their present limitations and apparent dissonances is raised to its full potentiality on the supramental level. For there an intense oneness with all creatures founded on a profound oneness of the soul with the Divine can harmonise with a play of relations that only makes the oneness more perfect and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span>. The power of Love supramentalised can take hold of all living relations without hesitation or danger and turn them Godwards delivered from their crude, mixed and petty human settings and sublimated into the happy material of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine life</span>. For it is the very nature of the supramental experience that it can perpetuate the play of difference without forfeiting or in the least diminishing either the divine union or the infinite oneness. For a supramentalised consciousness it would be utterly possible to embrace all contacts with men and the world in a purified flame-force and with a transfigured significance, because the soul would then perceive always as the object of all emotion and all seeking for love or beauty the One Eternal and could spiritually use a wide and liberated life-urge to meet and join with that One Divine in all things and all creatures.\n\n---\n\nInto the third and last category of the works of sacrifice can be gathered all that is directly proper to the Yoga of works; for here is its direct field of effectuation and major province. It covers the entire range of life's more visible activities; under it fall the multiform energies of the Will-to-Life throwing itself outward to make the most of material existence. It is here that an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> or other-worldly spirituality feels an insurmountable denial of the Truth which it seeks after and is compelled to turn away from terrestrial existence, rejecting it as for ever the dark<span class='page-number' id='s-169' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.169]</span> playground of an incurable Ignorance. Yet it is precisely these activities that are claimed for a spiritual conquest and divine transformation by the integral Yoga. Abandoned altogether by the more ascetic disciplines, accepted by others only as a field of temporary ordeal or a momentary, superficial and ambiguous play of the concealed spirit, this existence is fully embraced and welcomed by the integral seeker as a field of fulfilment, a field for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine works</span>, a field of the total self-discovery of the concealed and indwelling spirit. A discovery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> in oneself is his first object, but a total discovery too of the Divinity in the world behind the apparent denial offered by its scheme and figures and, last, a total discovery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dynamism</span> of some transcendent Eternal; for by its descent this world and self will be empowered to break their disguising envelopes and become divine in revealing form and manifesting process as they now are secretly in their hidden essence.\n\nThis object of the integral Yoga must be accepted wholly by those who follow it, but the acceptance must not be in ignorance of the immense stumbling-blocks that lie in the way of the achievement; on the contrary we must be fully aware of the compelling cause of the refusal of so many other disciplines to regard even its possibility, much less its imperative character, as the true meaning of terrestrial existence. For here in the works of life in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span> is the very heart of the difficulty that has driven Philosophy to its heights of aloofness and turned away even the eager eye of Religion from the malady of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> in a mortal body to a distant Paradise or a silent peace of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. A way of pure Knowledge is comparatively straightforward and easy to the tread of the seeker in spite of our mental limitations and the pitfalls of the Ignorance; a way of pure Love, although it has its stumbling-blocks and its sufferings and trials, can in comparison be as easy as the winging of a bird through the free azure. For Knowledge and Love are pure in their essence and become mixed and embarrassed, corrupted and degraded only when they enter into the ambiguous movement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-forces</span> and are seized by them for the outward life's crude movements and obstinately inferior motives. Alone of the three powers Life<span class='page-number' id='s-170' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.170]</span> or at least a certain predominant Will-in-Life has the appearance of something impure, accursed or fallen in its very essence. At its contact, wrapped in its dull sheaths or caught in its iridescent quagmires, the divinities themselves become common and muddy and hardly escape from being dragged downwards into its perversions and disastrously assimilated to the demon and the Asura. A principle of dark and dull inertia is at its base; all are tied down by the body and its needs and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> to a trivial mind, petty desires and emotions, an insignificant repetition of small worthless functionings, needs, cares, occupations, pains, pleasures that lead to nothing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> themselves and bear the stamp of an ignorance that knows not its own why and whither. This physical mind of inertia believes in no divinity other than its own small earth-gods; it aspires perhaps to a greater comfort, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, pleasure, but asks for no uplifting and no spiritual deliverance. At the centre we meet a stronger Will of life with a greater gusto, but it is a blinded <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Daemon</span>, a perverted spirit and exults in the very elements that make of life a striving turmoil and an unhappy imbroglio. It is a soul of human or Titanic desire clinging to the garish colour, disordered poetry, violent tragedy or stirring melodrama of this mixed flux of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, joy and sorrow, light and darkness, heady rapture and bitter torture. It loves these things and would have more and more of them or, even when it suffers and cries out against them, can accept or joy in nothing else; it hates and revolts against higher things and in its fury would trample, tear or crucify any diviner Power that has the presumption to offer to make life pure, luminous and happy and snatch from its lips the fiery brew of that exciting mixture. Another Will-in-Life there is that is ready to follow the ameliorating ideal Mind and is allured by its offer to extract some harmony, beauty, light, nobler order out of life, but this is a smaller part of the vital nature and can be easily overpowered by its more violent or darker duller yoke-comrades; nor does it readily lend itself to a call higher than that of the Mind unless that call defeats itself, as Religion usually does, by lowering its demand to conditions more intelligible to our obscure vital nature. All these forces the spiritual seeker grows<span class='page-number' id='s-171' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.171]</span> aware of in himself and finds all around him and has to struggle and combat incessantly to be rid of their grip and dislodge the long-entrenched mastery they have exercised over his own being as over the environing human existence. The difficulty is great; for their hold is so strong, so apparently invincible that it justifies the disdainful dictum which compares human nature to a dog's tail,—for, straighten it never so much by force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span>, religion, reason or any other redemptive effort, it returns in the end always to the crooked curl of Nature. And so great is the vim, the clutch of that more agitated Life-Will, so immense the peril of its passions and errors, so subtly insistent or persistently invasive, so obstinate up to the very gates of Heaven the fury of its attack or the tedious obstruction of its obstacles that even the saint and the Yogin cannot be sure of their liberated purity or their trained self-mastery against its intrigue or its violence. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> to straighten out this native crookedness strikes the struggling will as a futility; a flight, a withdrawal to happy Heaven or peaceful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> easily finds credit as the only wisdom and to find a way not to be born again gets established as the only remedy for the dull bondage or the poor shoddy delirium or the blinded and precarious happiness and achievement of earthly existence.\n\nA remedy yet there should be and is, a way of redress and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of transformation for this troubled vital nature; but for that the cause of deviation must be found and remedied at the heart of Life itself and in its very principle, since Life too is a power of the Divine and not a creation of some malignant Chance or dark Titanic impulse, however obscure or perverted may be its actual appearance. In Life itself there is the seed of its own salvation, it is from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-Energy</span> that we must get our leverage; for though there is a saving light in Knowledge, a redeeming and transforming force in Love, these cannot be effective here unless they secure the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> of Life and can use the instrumentation of some delivered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> at its centre for a sublimation of the erring human into a divine Life-Force. It is not possible to cut the difficulty by a splitting up of the works of sacrifice; we cannot escape it by deciding that we shall<span class='page-number' id='s-172' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.172]</span> do only the works of Love and Knowledge and leave aside the works of will and power, possession and acquisition, production and fruitful expense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, battle and victory and mastery, striking away from us the larger part of life because it seems to be made of the very stuff of desire and ego and therefore doomed to be a field of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disharmony</span> and mere conflict and disorder. For the division cannot really be made; or, if attempted, it must fail in its essential purpose, since it would isolate us from the total energies of the World-Power and sterilise an important part of integral Nature, just the one force in it that is a necessary instrument in any world-creative purpose. The Life-Force is an indispensable intermediary, the effectuating element in Nature here; mind needs its alliance if the works of mind are not to remain shining inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> without a body; the spirit needs it to give an outer force and form to its manifested possibilities and arrive at a complete self-expression incarnated in Matter. If Life refuses the aid of its intermediary energy to the spirit's other workings or is itself refused, they are likely to be reduced for all the effect they can have here to a static seclusion or a golden impotence; or if anything is done, it will be a partial irradiation of our action more subjective than objective, modifying existence perhaps, but without force to change it. Yet if Life brings its forces to the spirit but unregenerate, a worse result may follow since it is likely to reduce the spiritual action of Love or Knowledge to diminished and corrupted motions or make them accomplices of its own inferior or perverse workings. Life is indispensable to the completeness of the creative spiritual realisation, but life released, transformed, uplifted, not the ordinary mentalised human-animal life, nor the demoniac or Titanic, nor even the divine and the undivine mixed together. Whatever may be done by other world-shunning or heaven-seeking disciplines, this is the difficult but unavoidable task of the integral Yoga; it cannot afford to leave unsolved the problem of the outward works of Life, it must find in them their native Divinity and ally it firmly and for ever to the divinities of Love and Knowledge.\n\nIt is no solution either to postpone dealing with the works of Life till Love and Knowledge have been evolved to a point<span class='page-number' id='s-173' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.173]</span> at which they can sovereignly and with safety lay hold on the Life-Force to regenerate it; for we have seen that they have to rise to immense heights before they can be secure from the vital perversion which hampers or hamstrings their power to deliver. If once our consciousness could reach the heights of a supramental Nature, then indeed these disabilities would disappear. But here there is the dilemma that it is impossible to reach the supramental heights with the burden of an unregenerated Life-Force on our shoulders and equally impossible to regenerate radically the Will-in-Life without bringing down the infallible light and unconquerable power that belong to the spiritual and supramental levels. The Supramental Consciousness is not only a Knowledge, a Bliss, an intimate Love and Oneness, it is also a Will, a principle of Power and Force, and it cannot descend till the element of Will, of Power, of Force in this manifested Nature is sufficiently developed and sublimated to receive and bear it. But Will, Power, Force are the native substance of the Life-Energy, and herein lies the justification for the refusal of Life to acknowledge the supremacy of Knowledge and Love alone,—for its push towards the satisfaction of something far more unreflecting, headstrong and dangerous that can yet venture too in its own bold and ardent way towards the Divine and Absolute. Love and Wisdom are not the only aspects of the Divine, there is also its aspect of Power. As the mind gropes for Knowledge, as the heart feels out for Love, so the life-force, however fumblingly or trepidantly, stumbles in search of Power and the control given by Power. It is a mistake of the ethical or religious mind to condemn Power as in itself a thing not to be accepted or sought after because naturally corrupting and evil; in spite of its apparent justification by a majority of instances, this is at its core a blind and irrational prejudice. However corrupted and misused, as Love and Knowledge too are corrupted and misused, Power is divine and put here for a divine use. Shakti, Will, Power is the driver of the worlds and, whether it be Knowledge-Force or Love-Force or Life-Force or Action-Force or Body-Force, is always spiritual in its origin and divine in its native character. It is the use of it made in the Ignorance by brute, man or Titan<span class='page-number' id='s-174' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.174]</span> that has to be cast aside and replaced by its greater natural—even if to us supernormal—action led by the Light of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner consciousness</span> which is in tune with the Infinite and the Eternal. The integral Yoga cannot reject the works of Life and be satisfied with an inward experience only; it has to go inward in order to change the outward, making the Life-Force a part and a working of a Yoga-Energy which is in touch with the Divine and divine in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>.\n\nAll the difficulty in dealing spiritually with the works of Life arises because the Will-in-Life for its purposes in the Ignorance has created a false soul of desire and substituted it for that spark of the Divine which is the true psyche. All or most of the works of life are at present or seem to be actuated and vitiated by this soul of desire; even those that are ethical or religious, even those that wear the guise of altruism, philanthropy, self-sacrifice, self-denial, are shot through and through with the threads of its making. This soul of desire is a separative soul of ego and all its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span> are for a separative self-affirmation; it pushes always, openly or under more or less shining masks, for its own growth, for possession, for enjoyment, for conquest and empire. If the curse of disquiet and disharmony and perversion is to be lifted from Life, the true soul, the psychic being, must be given its leading place and there must be a dissolution of the false soul of desire and ego. But this does not mean that life itself must be coerced and denied its native line of fulfilment; for behind this outer life soul of desire there is in us an inner and true vital being which has not to be dissolved but brought out into prominence and released to its true working as a power of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Nature</span>. The prominence of this true vital being under the lead of the true inmost soul within us is the condition for the divine fulfilment of the objects of the Life-Force. Those objects will even remain the same in essence, but transformed in their inner motive and outer character. The Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-Power</span> too will be a will for growth, a force of self-affirmation, but affirmation of the Divine within us, not of the little temporary personality on the surface,—growth into the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Individual</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>central being</span>, the secret imperishable Person who can emerge only by<span class='page-number' id='s-175' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.175]</span> the subordination and disappearance of the ego. This is life's true object: growth, but a growth of the spirit in Nature, affirming and developing itself in mind, life and body; possession, but a possession by the Divine of the Divine in all things, and not of things for their own sake by the desire of the ego; enjoyment, but an enjoyment of the divine Ananda in the universe; battle and conquest and empire in the shape of a victorious conflict with the Powers of Darkness, an entire spiritual self-rule and mastery over inward and outward Nature, a conquest by Knowledge, Love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span> over the domains of the Ignorance.\n\nThese are the conditions and these must be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of the divine effectuation of the works of Life and their progressive transformation which is the third element of the triple sacrifice. It is not a rationalisation but a supramentalisation, not a moralising but a spiritualising of life that is the object of the Yoga. It is not a handling of externals or superficial psychological motives that is its main purpose, but a refounding of life and its action on their hidden divine element; for only such a refounding of life can bring about its direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> by the secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Power</span> above us and its transfiguration into a manifest expression of the Divinity, not as now a disguise and a disfiguring mask of the eternal Actor. It is a spiritual essential change of consciousness, not the surface manipulation which is the method of Mind and Reason, that can alone make Life other than it now is and rescue it out of its present distressed and ambiguous figure.\n\n---\n\nIt is then by a transformation of life in its very principle, not by an external manipulation of its phenomena, that the integral Yoga proposes to change it from a troubled and ignorant into a luminous and harmonious movement of Nature. There are three conditions which are indispensable for the achievement of this central inner revolution and new formation; none of them is altogether sufficient in itself, but by their united threefold power the uplifting can be done, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> made and completely made. For, first, life as it is is a movement of desire and it has<span class='page-number' id='s-176' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.176]</span> built in us as its centre a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> which refers to itself all the motions of life and puts in them its own troubled hue and pain of an ignorant, half-lit, baffled endeavour: for a divine living, desire must be abolished and replaced by a purer and firmer motive-power, the tormented soul of desire dissolved and in its stead there must emerge the calm, strength, happiness of a true vital being now concealed within us. Next, life as it is is driven or led partly by the impulse of the life-force, partly by a mind which is mostly a servant and abettor of the ignorant life-impulse, but in part also its uneasy and not too luminous or competent guide and mentor; for a divine life the mind and the life-impulse must cease to be anything but instruments and the inmost psychic being must take their place as the leader on the path and the indicator of a divine guidance. Last, life as it is is turned towards the satisfaction of the separative ego; ego must disappear and be replaced by the true spiritual person, the central being, and life itself must be turned towards the fulfilment of the Divine in terrestrial existence; it must feel a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Force</span> awaking within it and become an obedient instrumentation of its purpose.\n\nThere is nothing that is not ancient and familiar in the first of these three transforming inner movements; for it has always been one of the principal objects of spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span>. It has been best formulated in the already expressed doctrine of the Gita by which a complete renouncement of desire for the fruits as the motive of action, a complete annulment of desire itself, the complete achievement of a perfect equality are put forward as the normal status of a spiritual being. A perfect spiritual equality is the one true and infallible sign of the cessation of desire,—to be equal-souled to all things, unmoved by joy and sorrow, the pleasant and the unpleasant, success or failure, to look with an equal eye on high and low, friend and enemy, the virtuous and the sinner, to see in all beings the manifold manifestation of the One and in all things the multitudinous play or the slow masked evolution of the embodied Spirit. It is not a mental quiet, aloofness, indifference, not an inert vital quiescence, not a passivity of the physical consciousness consenting to no movement or to any movement that is the condition aimed at, though these<span class='page-number' id='s-177' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.177]</span> things are sometimes mistaken for this spiritual condition, but a wide comprehensive unmoved universality such as that of the Witness Spirit behind Nature. For all here seems to be a mobile half-ordered half-confused organisation of forces, but behind them one can feel a supporting peace, silence, wideness, not inert but calm, not impotent but potentially omnipotent with a concentrated, stable, immobile energy in it capable of bearing all the motions of the universe. This Presence behind is equal-souled to all things: the energy it holds in it can be unloosed for any action, but no action will be chosen by any desire in the Witness Spirit; a Truth acts which is beyond and greater than the action itself or its apparent forms and impulses, beyond and greater than mind or life-force or body, although it may take for the immediate purpose a mental, a vital or a physical appearance. It is when there is this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of desire and this calm equal wideness in the consciousness everywhere, that the true vital being within us comes out from the veil and reveals its own calm, intense and potent presence. For such is the true nature of the vital being, *prāṇamaya puruṣa*; it is a projection of the Divine Purusha into life,—tranquil, strong, luminous, many-energied, obedient to the Divine Will, egoless, yet or rather therefore capable of all action, achievement, highest or largest enterprise. The true Life-Force too reveals itself as no longer this troubled harassed divided striving surface energy, but a great and radiant Divine Power, full of peace and strength and bliss, a wide-wayed Angel of Life with its wings of Might enfolding the universe.\n\nAnd yet this transformation into a large strength and equality is insufficient; for if it opens to us the instrumentation of a Divine Life, it does not provide its government and initiative. It is here that the presence of the released psychic being intervenes; it does not give the supreme government and direction,—for that is not its function,—but it supplies during the transition from ignorance to a divine Knowledge a progressive guidance for the inner and outer life and action; it indicates at each moment the method, the way, the steps that will lead to that fulfilled spiritual condition in which a supreme dynamic initiative will be always there directing the activities of a divinised Life-Force.<span class='page-number' id='s-178' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.178]</span> The light it sheds illuminates the other parts of the nature which, for want of any better guidance than their own confused and groping powers, have been wandering in the rounds of the Ignorance; it gives to mind the intrinsic feeling of the thoughts and perceptions, to life the infallible sense of the movements that are misled or misleading and those that are well-inspired; something like a quiet oracle from within discloses the causes of our stumblings, warns in time against their repetition, extracts from experience and intuition the law, not rigid but plastic, of a just direction for our acts, a right stepping, an accurate impulse. A will is created that becomes more in consonance with evolving Truth rather than with the circling and dilatory mazes of a seeking Error. A determined orientation towards the greater Light to be, a soul-instinct, a psychic tact and insight into the true substance, motion and intention of things, coming always nearer and nearer to a spiritual vision, to a knowledge by inner contact, inner sight and even <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>, begin to replace the superficial keenness of mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> and the eager graspings of the life-force. The works of Life right themselves, escape from confusion, substitute for the artificial or legal order imposed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and for the arbitrary rule of desire the guidance of the soul's inner insight, enter into the profound paths of the Spirit. Above all, the psychic being imposes on life the law of the sacrifice of all its works as an offering to the Divine and the Eternal. Life becomes a call to that which is beyond Life; its every smallest act enlarges with the sense of the Infinite.\n\nAs an inner equality increases and with it the sense of the true vital being waiting for the greater direction it has to serve, as the psychic call too increases in all the members of our nature, That to which the call is addressed begins to reveal itself, descends to take possession of the life and its energies and fills them with the height, intimacy, vastness of its presence and its purpose. In many, if not most, it manifests something of itself even before the equality and the open psychic urge or guidance are there. A call of the veiled psychic element oppressed by the mass of the outer ignorance and crying for deliverance, a stress of eager <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> and seeking for knowledge, a longing of the<span class='page-number' id='s-179' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.179]</span> heart, a passionate will ignorant yet but sincere may break the lid that shuts off that Higher from this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lower Nature</span> and open the floodgates. A little of the Divine Person may reveal itself or some Light, Power, Bliss, Love out of the Infinite. This may be a momentary revelation, a flash or a brief-lived gleam that soon withdraws and waits for the preparation of the nature; but also it may repeat itself, grow, endure. A long and large and comprehensive working will then have begun, sometimes luminous or intense, sometimes slow and obscure. A Divine Power comes in front at times and leads and compels or instructs and enlightens; at others it withdraws into the background and seems to leave the being to its own resources. All that is ignorant, obscure, perverted or simply imperfect and inferior in the being is raised up, perhaps brought to its acme, dealt with, corrected, exhausted, shown its own disastrous results, compelled to call for its own cessation or transformation or expelled as worthless or incorrigible from the nature. This cannot be a smooth and even process; alternations there are of day and night, illumination and darkness, calm and construction or battle and upheaval, the presence of the growing Divine Consciousness and its absence, heights of hope and abysses of despair, the clasp of the Beloved and the anguish of its absence, the overwhelming invasion, the compelling deceit, the fierce opposition, the disabling mockery of hostile Powers or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> and comfort and communion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span> and the Divine Messengers. A great and long revolution and churning of the ocean of Life with strong emergences of its nectar and its poison is enforced till all is ready and the increasing Descent finds a being, a nature prepared and conditioned for its complete rule and its all-encompassing presence. But if the equality and the psychic light and will are already there, then this process, though it cannot be dispensed with, can still be much lightened and facilitated: it will be rid of its worst dangers; an inner calm, happiness, confidence will support the steps through all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> and trials of the transformation and the growing Force profiting by the full assent of the nature will rapidly diminish and eliminate the power of the opposing forces. A sure guidance and protection will be present throughout, sometimes<span class='page-number' id='s-180' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.180]</span> standing in front, sometimes working behind the veil, and the power of the end will be already there even in the beginning and in the long middle stages of the great endeavour. For at all times the seeker will be aware of the Divine Guide and Protector or the working of the supreme Mother-Force; he will know that all is done for the best, the progress assured, the victory inevitable. In either case the process is the same and unavoidable, a taking up of the whole nature, of the whole life, of the internal and of the external, to reveal and handle and transform its forces and their movements under the pressure of a diviner Life from above, until all here has been possessed by greater spiritual powers and made an instrumentation of a spiritual action and a divine purpose.\n\nIn this process and at an early stage of it it becomes evident that what we know of ourselves, our present conscious existence, is only a representative formation, a superficial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, a changing external result of a vast mass of concealed existence. Our visible life and the actions of that life are no more than a series of significant expressions, but that which it tries to express is not on the surface; our existence is something much larger than this apparent frontal being which we suppose ourselves to be and which we offer to the world around us. This frontal and external being is a confused amalgam of mind-formations, life-movements, physical functionings of which even an exhaustive analysis into its component parts and machinery fails to reveal the whole secret. It is only when we go behind, below, above into the hidden stretches of our being that we can know it; the most thorough and acute surface scrutiny and manipulation cannot give us the true understanding or the completely effective control of our life, its purposes, its activities; that inability indeed is the cause of the failure of reason, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span> and every other surface action to control and deliver and perfect the life of the human race. For below even our most obscure physical consciousness is a subconscious being in which as in a covering and supporting soil are all manner of hidden seeds that sprout up, unaccountably to us, on our surface and into which we are constantly throwing fresh seeds that prolong our past and will influence our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>,—a subconscious being, obscure, small in its motions, capriciously<span class='page-number' id='s-181' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.181]</span> and almost fantastically subrational, but of an immense potency for the earth-life. Again behind our mind, our life, our conscious physical there is a larger subliminal consciousness,—there are inner mental, inner vital, inner more subtle physical reaches supported by an inmost psychic existence which is the animating soul of all the rest; and in these hidden reaches too lie a mass of numerous pre-existent personalities which supply the material, the motive-forces, the impulsions of our developing surface existence. For in each one of us here there may be one central person, but also a multitude of subordinate personalities created by the past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of its manifestation or by expressions of it on these inner planes which support its present play in this external material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>. And while on our surface we are cut off from all around us except through an exterior mind and sense contact which delivers but little of us to our world or of our world to us, in these inner reaches the barrier between us and the rest of existence is thin and easily broken; there we can feel at once—not merely infer from their results, but feel directly—the action of the secret world-forces, mind-forces, life-forces, subtle physical forces that constitute universal and individual existence; we shall even be able, if we will but train ourselves to it, to lay our hands on these world-forces that throw themselves on us or surround us and more and more to control or at least strongly modify their action on us and others, their formations, their very movements. Yet again, above our human mind are still greater reaches superconscient to it and from there secretly descend influences, powers, touches which are the original determinants of things here and, if they were called down in their fullness, could altogether alter the whole make and economy of life in the material universe. It is all this latent experience and knowledge that the Divine Force working upon us by our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> to it in the integral Yoga, progressively reveals to us, uses and works out the consequences as means and steps towards a transformation of our whole being and nature. Our life is thenceforth no longer a little rolling wave on the surface, but interpenetrant if not coincident with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> life. Our spirit, our self rises not only into an inner identity with some wide <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Self</span> but into<span class='page-number' id='s-182' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.182]</span> some contact with that which is beyond, though aware of and dominant over the action of the universe.\n\nIt is thus by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integralisation</span> of our divided being that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> in the Yoga will proceed to its object; for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, perfection, mastery are dependent on this integralisation, since the little wave on the surface cannot control its own movement, much less have any true control over the vast life around it. The Shakti, the power of the Infinite and the Eternal descends within us, works, breaks up our present psychological formations, shatters every wall, widens, liberates, presents us with always newer and greater powers of vision, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideation</span>, perception and newer and greater life-motives, enlarges and new-models increasingly the soul and its instruments, confronts us with every imperfection in order to convict and destroy it, opens to a greater perfection, does in a brief period the work of many lives or ages so that new births and new vistas open constantly within us. Expansive in her action, she frees the consciousness from confinement in the body; it can go out in trance or sleep or even waking and enter into worlds or other regions of this world and act there or carry back its experience. It spreads out, feeling the body only as a small part of itself, and begins to contain what before contained it; it achieves the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic consciousness</span> and extends itself to be commensurate with the universe. It begins to know inwardly and directly and not merely by external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> and contact the forces at play in the world, feels their movement, distinguishes their functioning and can operate immediately upon them as the scientist operates upon physical forces, accept their action and results in our mind, life, body or reject them or modify, change, reshape, create immense new powers and movements in place of the old small functionings of the nature. We begin to perceive the working of the forces of universal Mind and to know how our thoughts are created by that working, separate from within the truth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> of our perceptions, enlarge their field, extend and illumine their significance, become master of our own minds and active to shape the movements of Mind in the world around us. We begin to perceive the flow and surge of the universal life-forces,<span class='page-number' id='s-183' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.183]</span> detect the origin and law of our feelings, emotions, sensations, passions, are free to accept, reject, new-create, open to wider, rise to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span> of Life-Power. We begin to perceive too the key to the enigma of Matter, follow the interplay of Mind and Life and Consciousness upon it, discover more and more its instrumental and resultant function and detect ultimately the last secret of Matter as a form not merely of Energy but of involved and arrested or unstably fixed and restricted consciousness and begin to see too the possibility of its liberation and plasticity of response to higher Powers, its possibilities for the conscious and no longer the more than half-inconscient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incarnation</span> and self-expression of the Spirit. All this and more becomes more and more possible as the working of the Divine Shakti increases in us and, against much resistance or labour to respond of our obscure consciousness, through much struggle and movement of progress and regression and renewed progress necessitated by the work of intensive transformation of a half-inconscient into a conscious substance, moves to a greater purity, truth, height, range. All depends on the psychic awakening in us, the completeness of our response to her and our growing surrender.\n\nBut all this can only constitute a greater inner life with a greater possibility of the outer action and is a transitional achievement; the full transformation can come only by the ascent of the sacrifice to its farthest heights and its action upon life with the power and light and beatitude of the divine supramental Gnosis. For then alone all the forces that are divided and express themselves imperfectly in life and its works are raised to their original unity, harmony, single truth, authentic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absoluteness</span> and entire significance. There Knowledge and Will are one, Love and Force a single movement; the opposites that afflict us here are resolved into their reconciled unity: good develops its absolute and evil divesting itself of its error returns to the good that was behind it; sin and virtue vanish in a divine purity and an infallible truth-movement; the dubious evanescence of pleasure disappears in a Bliss that is the play of an eternal and happy spiritual certitude, and pain in perishing discovers the touch of an Ananda which was betrayed by some dark perversion and<span class='page-number' id='s-184' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.184]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> of the will of the Inconscient to receive it. These things, to the Mind an imagination or a mystery, become evident and capable of experience as the consciousness rises out of limited embodied Matter-mind to the freedom and fullness of the higher and higher ranges of the super-intelligence; but they can become entirely true and normal only when the supramental becomes the law of the nature.\n\nIt is therefore on the accomplishment of this ascent and on the possibility of a full dynamism from these highest levels descending into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-consciousness</span> that is dependent the justification of Life, its salvation, its transformation into a Divine Life in a transfigured terrestrial Nature.\n\n---\n\nThe nature of the integral Yoga so conceived, so conditioned, progressing by these spiritual means, turning upon this integral transformation of the nature, determines of itself its answer to the question of the ordinary activities of life and their place in the Yoga.\n\nThere is not and cannot be here any ascetic or contemplative or mystic abandonment of works and life altogether, any gospel of an absorbed meditation and inactivity, any cutting away or condemnation of the Life-Force and its activities, any rejection of the manifestation in the earth-nature. It may be necessary for the seeker at any period to withdraw into himself, to remain plunged in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span>, to shut out from him the noise and turmoil of the life of the Ignorance until a certain inner change has been accomplished or something achieved without which a further effective action on life has become difficult or impossible. But this can only be a period or an episode, a temporary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> or a preparatory spiritual manoeuvre; it cannot be the rule of his Yoga or its principle.\n\nA splitting up of the activities of human existence on a religious or an ethical basis or both together, a restriction to the works of worship only or to the works of philanthropy and beneficence only would be contrary to the spirit of the integral<span class='page-number' id='s-185' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.185]</span> Yoga. Any merely mental rule or merely mental acceptance or repudiation is alien to the purpose and method of its discipline. All must be taken to a spiritual height and placed upon a spiritual basis; the presence of an inner spiritual change and an outer transformation must be enforced upon the whole of life and not merely on a part of life; all must be accepted that is helpful towards this change or admits it, all must be rejected that is incapable or inapt or refuses to submit itself to the transforming movement. There must be no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to any form of things or of life, any object, any activity; all must be renounced if need be, all must be admitted that the Divine chooses as its material for the divine life. But what accepts or rejects must be neither mind nor open or camouflaged vital will of desire nor ethical sense, but the insistence of the psychic being, the command of the Divine Guide of the Yoga, the vision of the higher Self or Spirit, the illumined guidance of the Master. The way of the spirit is not a mental way; a mental rule or mental consciousness cannot be its determinant or its leader.\n\nEqually, a combination or a compromise between two orders of consciousness, the spiritual and the mental or the spiritual and the vital or a mere sublimation from within of Life outwardly unchanged cannot be the law or the aim of the Yoga. All life must be taken up but all life must be transformed; all must become a part, a form, an adequate expression of a spiritual being in the supramental nature. This is the height and crowning movement of a spiritual evolution in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span>, and as the change from the vital animal to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span> made life another thing altogether in basic consciousness, scope, significance, so this change from the materialised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> to the spiritual and supramental being using but not dominated by matter must take up life and make it another thing altogether than the flawed, imperfect limited human, quite other in its basic consciousness, scope, significance. All forms of life activity that cannot bear the change must disappear, all that can bear it will survive and enter into the kingdom of the spirit. A divine Force is at work and will choose at each moment what has to be done or has not to be done, what has to be momentarily or permanently taken up,<span class='page-number' id='s-186' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.186]</span> momentarily or permanently abandoned. For provided we do not substitute for that our desire or our ego, and to that end the soul must be always awake, always on guard, alive to the divine guidance, resistant to the undivine misleading from within or without us, that Force is sufficient and alone competent and she will lead us to the fulfilment along ways and by means too large, too inward, too complex for the mind to follow, much less to dictate. It is an arduous and difficult and dangerous way, but there is none other.\n\nTwo rules alone there are that will diminish the difficulty and obviate the danger. One must reject all that comes from the ego, from vital desire, from the mere mind and its presumptuous reasoning incompetence, all that ministers to these agents of the Ignorance. One must learn to hear and follow the voice of the inmost soul, the direction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guru</span>, the command of the Master, the working of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Mother</span>. Whoever clings to the desires and weaknesses of the flesh, the cravings and passions of the vital in its turbulent ignorance, the dictates of his personal mind unsilenced and unillumined by a greater knowledge, cannot find the true inner law and is heaping obstacles in the way of the divine fulfilment. Whoever is able to detect and renounce those obscuring agencies and to discern and follow the true Guide within and without will discover the spiritual law and reach the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of the Yoga.\n\nA radical and total change of consciousness is not only the whole meaning but, in an increasing force and by progressive stages, the whole method of the integral Yoga.<span class='page-number' id='s-187' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.187]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-ii","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"Standards of Conduct and Spiritual Freedom","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/standards-of-conduct-and-spiritual-freedom","prvt":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - I","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-i","subt":"The Works of Love - The Works of Life","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["standards-of-conduct-and-spiritual-freedom"],"t":"Standards of Conduct and Spiritual Freedom","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> on which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> of works in Yoga has to found <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and development has for the keystone of its structure a more and more concrete perception of unity, the living sense of an all-pervading <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>; he moves in the increasing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> as an indivisible whole: all work too is part of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> indivisible whole.

Every standpoint, every man-made rule of action which ignores the indivisible totality of the cosmic movement, whatever its utility in external practice, is to the eye of spiritual Truth an imperfect view and a law of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>.\n\nEven when we have arrived at some glimpse of this idea or succeeded in fixing it in our consciousness as a knowledge of the mind and a consequent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the soul, it is difficult for us in our outward parts and active nature to square accounts between this universal standpoint and the claims of our personal opinion, our personal will, our personal emotion and desire. We are forced still to go on dealing with this indivisible movement as if it were a mass of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> out of which we, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, the person, have to carve something according to our own will and mental fantasy by a personal struggle and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>. This is man's normal attitude towards his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, actually false because our ego and its will are creations and puppets of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic forces</span> and it is only when we withdraw from ego into the consciousness of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge-Will</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> who acts in them that we can be by a sort of deputation from above their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>. And yet is this personal position the right attitude for man so long as he cherishes his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> and has not yet fully developed it; for without this view-point and motive-force he cannot grow in his ego, cannot sufficiently develop and differentiate himself out of the subconscious or half-conscious universal mass-existence.\n\nBut the hold of this ego-consciousness upon our whole habit of existence is difficult to shake off when we have no longer need of the separative, the individualistic and aggressive stage of development, when we would proceed forward from this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of littleness in the child-soul to unity and universality, to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic consciousness</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, to our transcendent spirit-stature. It is indispensable to recognise clearly, not only in our mode of thought but in our way of feeling, sensing, doing, that this movement, this universal action is not a helpless impersonal wave of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> which lends itself to the will of any ego according<span class='page-number' id='s-189' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.189]</span> to that ego's strength and insistence. It is the movement of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Being</span> who is the Knower of his field, the steps of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> who is the Master of his own progressive force of action. As the movement is one and indivisible, so he who is present in the movement is one, sole and indivisible. Not only all result is determined by him, but all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span>, action and process are dependent on the motion of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic force</span> and only belong secondarily and in their form to the creature.\n\nBut what then must be the spiritual position of the personal worker? What is his true relation in dynamic Nature to this one cosmic Being and this one total movement? He is a centre only—a centre of differentiation of the one personal consciousness, a centre of determination of the one total movement; his personality reflects in a wave of persistent individuality the one universal Person, the Transcendent, the Eternal. In the Ignorance it is always a broken and distorted reflection because the crest of the wave which is our conscious waking self throws back only an imperfect and falsified similitude of the divine Spirit. All our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>, standards, formations, principles are only attempts to represent in this broken, reflecting and distorting mirror something of the universal and progressive total action and its many-sided movement towards some ultimate self-revelation of the Divine. Our mind represents it as best it can with a narrow approximation that becomes less and less inadequate in proportion as its thought grows in wideness and light and power; but it is always an approximation and not even a true partial figure. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span> acts through the aeons to reveal progressively not only in the unity of the cosmos, not only in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collectivity</span> of living and thinking creatures, but in the soul of each individual something of its divine Mystery and the hidden truth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>. Therefore there is in the cosmos, in the collectivity, in the individual, a rooted instinct or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> in its own perfectibility, a constant drive towards an ever increasing and more adequate and more harmonious self-development nearer to the secret truth of things. This effort is represented to the constructing mind of man by standards of knowledge, feeling, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthesis</span> and action,—rules, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, norms<span class='page-number' id='s-190' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.190]</span> and laws that he essays to turn into universal dharmas.\n\n---\n\nIf we are to be free in the spirit, if we are to be subject only to the supreme Truth, we must discard the idea that our mental or moral laws are binding on the Infinite or that there can be anything sacrosanct, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> or eternal even in the highest of our existing standards of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>. To form higher and higher temporary standards as long as they are needed is to serve the Divine in his world march; to erect rigidly an absolute standard is to attempt the erection of a barrier against the eternal waters in their outflow. Once the nature-bound soul realises this truth, it is delivered from the duality of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>. For good is all that helps the individual and the world towards their divine fullness, and evil is all that retards or breaks up that increasing perfection. But since the perfection is progressive, evolutive in Time, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good and evil</span> are also shifting quantities and change from time to time their meaning and value. This thing which is evil now and in its present shape must be abandoned was once helpful and necessary to the general and individual progress. That other thing which we now regard as evil may well become in another form and arrangement an element in some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> perfection. And on the spiritual level we transcend even this distinction; for we discover the purpose and divine utility of all these things that we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> good and evil. Then have we to reject the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> in them and all that is distorted, ignorant and obscure in that which is called good no less than in that which is called evil. For we have then to accept only the true and the divine, but to make no other distinction in the eternal processes.\n\nTo those who can act only on a rigid standard, to those who can feel only the human and not the divine values, this truth may seem to be a dangerous concession which is likely to destroy the very foundation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span>, confuse all conduct and establish only chaos. Certainly, if the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> must be between an eternal and unchanging <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span> and no ethics at all, it would have that result for man in his ignorance. But even on the human level,<span class='page-number' id='s-191' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.191]</span> if we have light enough and flexibility enough to recognise that a standard of conduct may be temporary and yet necessary for its time and to observe it faithfully until it can be replaced by a better, then we suffer no such loss, but lose only the fanaticism of an imperfect and intolerant virtue. In its place we gain openness and a power of continual moral progression, charity, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to enter into an understanding sympathy with all this world of struggling and stumbling creatures and by that charity a better right and a greater strength to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> it upon its way. In the end where the human closes and the divine commences, where the mental disappears into the supramental consciousness and the finite precipitates itself into the infinite, all evil disappears into a transcendent divine Good which becomes universal on every plane of consciousness that it touches.\n\nThis, then, stands fixed for us that all standards by which we may seek to govern our conduct are only our temporary, imperfect and evolutive attempts to represent to ourselves our stumbling mental progress in the universal self-realisation towards which Nature moves. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span></span> cannot be bound by our little rules and fragile sanctities; for the consciousness behind it is too vast for these things. Once we have grasped this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, disconcerting enough to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> of our reason, we shall better be able to put in their right place in regard to each other the successive standards that govern the different stages in the growth of the individual and the collective march of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>. At the most general of them we may cast a passing glance. For we have to see how they stand in relation to that other standardless spiritual and supramental mode of working for which Yoga seeks and to which it moves by the surrender of the individual to the divine Will and, more effectively, through his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> by this surrender to the greater consciousness in which a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> with the dynamic Eternal becomes possible.\n\n---\n\nThere are four main standards of human conduct that make an ascending scale. The first is personal need, preference and desire;<span class='page-number' id='s-192' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.192]</span> the second is the law and good of the collectivity; the third is an ideal ethic; the last is the highest divine law of the nature.\n\nMan starts on the long career of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> with only the first two of these four to enlighten and lead him; for they constitute the law of his animal and vital existence, and it is as the vital and physical animal man that he begins his progress. The true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of man upon earth is to express in the type of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> a growing image of the Divine; whether knowingly or unknowingly, it is to this end that Nature is working in him under the thick veil of her inner and outer processes. But the material or animal man is ignorant of the inner aim of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>; he knows only its needs and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and he has necessarily no other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> to what is required of him than his own perception of need and his own stirrings and pointings of desire. To satisfy his physical and vital demands and necessities before all things else and, in the next rank, whatever emotional or mental cravings or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> or dynamic notions rise in him must be the first natural rule of his conduct. The sole balancing or overpowering law that can modify or contradict this pressing natural claim is the demand put on him by the ideas, needs and desires of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> or tribe, the herd, the pack of which he is a member.\n\nIf man could live to himself,—and this he could only do if the development of the individual were the sole object of the Divine in the world,—this second law would not at all need to come into operation. But all existence proceeds by the mutual action and reaction of the whole and the parts, the need for each other of the constituents and the thing constituted, the interdependence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> and the individuals of the group. In the language of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian philosophy</span> the Divine manifests himself always in the double form of the separative and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective being</span>, *vyaṣṭi, samaṣṭi*. Man, pressing after the growth of his separate individuality and its fullness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, is unable to satisfy even his own personal needs and desires except in conjunction with other men; he is a whole in himself and yet incomplete without others. This obligation englobes his personal law of conduct in a group-law which arises from the formation of a lasting group-entity with a collective mind and life of its<span class='page-number' id='s-193' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.193]</span> own to which his own embodied mind and life are subordinated as a transitory unit. And yet is there something in him immortal and free, not bound to this group-body which outlasts his own embodied existence but cannot outlast or claim to chain by its law his eternal spirit.\n\nIn itself this seemingly larger and overriding law is no more than an extension of the vital and animal principle that governs the individual elementary man; it is the law of the pack or herd. The individual identifies partially his life with the life of a certain number of other individuals with whom he is associated by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, choice or circumstance. And since the existence of the group is necessary for his own existence and satisfaction, in time, if not from the first, its preservation, the fulfilment of its needs and the satisfaction of its collective notions, desires, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of living, without which it would not hold together, must come to take a primary place. The satisfaction of personal idea and feeling, need and desire, propensity and habit has to be constantly subordinated, by the necessity of the situation and not from any moral or altruistic motive, to the satisfaction of the ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, needs and desires, propensities and habits, not of this or that other individual or number of individuals, but of the society as a whole. This social need is the obscure matrix of morality and of man's ethical impulse.\n\nIt is not actually known that in any primitive times man lived to himself or with only his mate as do some of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span>. All record of him shows him to us as a social animal, not an isolated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and spirit. The law of the pack has always overridden his individual law of self-development; he seems always to have been born, to have lived, to have been formed as a unit in a mass. But logically and naturally from the psychological view-point the law of personal need and desire is primary, the social law comes in as a secondary and usurping power. Man has in him two distinct master impulses, the individualistic and the communal, a personal life and a social life, a personal motive of conduct and a social motive of conduct. The possibility of their opposition and the attempt to find their equation lie at the very roots of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> and persist in other figures when he<span class='page-number' id='s-194' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.194]</span> has passed beyond the vital animal into a highly individualised mental and spiritual progress.\n\nThe existence of a social law external to the individual is at different times a considerable advantage and a heavy disadvantage to the development of the divine in man. It is an advantage at first when man is crude and incapable of self-control and self-finding, because it erects a power other than that of his personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> through which that egoism may be induced or compelled to moderate its savage demands, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> its irrational and often violent movements and even to lose itself sometimes in a larger and less personal egoism. It is a disadvantage to the adult spirit ready to transcend the human formula because it is an external standard which seeks to impose itself on him from outside, and the condition of his perfection is that he shall grow from within and in an increasing freedom, not by the suppression but by the transcendence of his perfected individuality, not any longer by a law imposed on him that trains and disciplines his members but by the soul from within breaking through all previous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> to possess with its light and transmute his members.\n\n---\n\nIn the conflict of the claims of society with the claims of the individual two ideal and absolute solutions confront one another. There is the demand of the group that the individual should subordinate himself more or less completely or even lose his independent existence in the community, the smaller must be immolated or self-offered to the larger unit. He must accept the need of the society as his own need, the desire of the society as his own desire; he must live not for himself but for the tribe, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commune</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> of which he is a member. The ideal and absolute solution from the individual's standpoint would be a society that existed not for itself, for its all-overriding collective purpose, but for the good of the individual and his fulfilment, for the greater and more perfect life of all its members. Representing as far as possible his best self and helping him to realise it, it would<span class='page-number' id='s-195' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.195]</span> respect the freedom of each of its members and maintain itself not by law and force but by the free and spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> of its constituent persons. An ideal society of either kind does not exist anywhere and would be most difficult to create, more difficult still to keep in precarious existence so long as individual man clings to his egoism as the primary motive of existence. A general but not complete domination of the society over the individual is the easier way and it is the system that Nature from the first instinctively adopts and keeps in equilibrium by rigorous law, compelling custom and a careful indoctrination of the still subservient and ill-developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> of the human creature.\n\nIn primitive societies the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual life</span> is submitted to rigid and immobile communal custom and rule; this is the ancient and would-be eternal law of the human pack that tries always to masquerade as the everlasting decree of the Imperishable, *eṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ*. And the ideal is not dead in the human mind; the most recent trend of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human progress</span> is to establish an enlarged and sumptuous edition of this ancient turn of collective living towards the enslavement of the human spirit. There is here a serious danger to the integral development of a greater truth upon earth and a greater life. For the desires and free seekings of the individual, however egoistic, however false or perverted they may be in their immediate form, contain in their obscure shell the seed of a development necessary to the whole; his searchings and stumblings have behind them a force that has to be kept and transmuted into the image of the divine ideal. That force needs to be enlightened and trained but must not be suppressed or harnessed exclusively to society's heavy cart-wheels. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Individualism</span> is as necessary to the final perfection as the power behind the group-spirit; the stifling of the individual may well be the stifling of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>god</span> in man. And in the present balance of humanity there is seldom any real danger of exaggerated individualism breaking up the social integer. There is continually a danger that the exaggerated pressure of the social mass by its heavy unenlightened mechanical weight may suppress or unduly discourage the free development of the individual spirit. For man in the individual can be more easily enlightened, conscious,<span class='page-number' id='s-196' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.196]</span> open to clear influences; man in the mass is still obscure, half-conscious, ruled by universal forces that escape its mastery and its knowledge.\n\nAgainst this danger of suppression and immobilisation Nature in the individual reacts. It may react by an isolated resistance ranging from the instinctive and brutal revolt of the criminal to the complete negation of the solitary and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>. It may react by the assertion of an individualistic trend in the social idea, may impose it on the mass consciousness and establish a compromise between the individual and the social demand. But a compromise is not a solution; it only salves over the difficulty and in the end increases the complexity of the problem and multiplies its issues. A new principle has to be called in other and higher than the two conflicting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span> and powerful at once to override and to reconcile them. Above the natural individual law which sets up as our one standard of conduct the satisfaction of our individual needs, preferences and desires and the natural communal law which sets up as a superior standard the satisfaction of the needs, preferences and desires of the community as a whole, there had to arise the notion of an ideal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral law</span> which is not the satisfaction of need and desire, but controls and even coerces or annuls them in the interests of an ideal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that is not animal, not vital and physical, but mental, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of the mind's seeking for light and knowledge and right rule and right movement and true order. The moment this notion becomes powerful in man, he begins to escape from the engrossing vital and material into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span>; he climbs from the first to the second degree of the threefold ascent of Nature. His needs and desires themselves are touched with a more elevated light of purpose and the mental need, the aesthetic, intellectual and emotional desire begin to predominate over the demand of the physical and vital nature.\n\n---\n\nThe natural law of conduct proceeds from a conflict to an equilibrium of forces, impulsions and desires; the higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethical law</span><span class='page-number' id='s-197' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.197]</span> proceeds by the development of the mental and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral nature</span> towards a fixed internal standard or else a self-formed ideal of absolute qualities,—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, righteousness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, right reason, right power, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, light. It is therefore essentially an individual standard; it is not a creation of the mass mind. The thinker is the individual; it is he who calls out and throws into forms that which would otherwise remain subconscious in the amorphous human whole. The moral striver is also the individual; self-discipline, not under the yoke of an outer law, but in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to an internal light, is essentially an individual effort. But by positing his personal standard as the translation of an absolute moral ideal the thinker imposes it, not on himself alone, but on all the individuals whom his thought can reach and penetrate. And as the mass of individuals come more and more to accept it in idea if only in an imperfect practice or no practice, society also is compelled to obey the new orientation. It absorbs the ideative influence and tries, not with any striking success, to mould its institutions into new forms touched by these higher ideals. But always its instinct is to translate them into binding law, into pattern forms, into mechanic custom, into an external social compulsion upon its living units.\n\nFor, long after the individual has become partially free, a moral organism capable of conscious growth, aware of an inward life, eager for spiritual progress, society continues to be external in its methods, a material and economic organism, mechanical, more intent upon status and self-preservation than on growth and self-perfection. The greatest present triumph of the thinking and progressive individual over the instinctive and static society has been the power he has acquired by his thought-will to compel it to think also, to open itself to the idea of social justice and righteousness, communal sympathy and mutual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span>, to feel after the rule of reason rather than blind custom as the test of its institutions and to look on the mental and moral assent of its individuals as at least one essential element in the validity of its laws. Ideally at least, to consider light rather than force as its sanction, moral development and not vengeance or restraint as the object even of its penal action, is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> just<span class='page-number' id='s-198' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.198]</span> possible to the communal mind. The greatest future triumph of the thinker will come when he can persuade the individual integer and the collective whole to rest their life-relation and its union and stability upon a free and harmonious consent and self-adaptation, and shape and govern the external by the internal truth rather than to constrain the inner spirit by the tyranny of the external form and structure.\n\nBut even this success that he has gained is rather a thing in potentiality than in actual accomplishment. There is always a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disharmony</span> and a discord between the moral law in the individual and the law of his needs and desires, between the moral law proposed to society and the physical and vital needs, desires, customs, prejudices, interests and passions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>, the clan, the religious community, the society, the nation. The moralist erects in vain his absolute ethical standard and calls upon all to be faithful to it without regard to consequences. To him the needs and desires of the individual are invalid if they are in conflict with the moral law, and the social law has no claims upon him if it is opposed to his sense of right and denied by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>. This is his absolute solution for the individual that he shall cherish no desires and claims that are not consistent with love, truth and justice. He demands from the community or nation that it shall hold all things cheap, even its safety and its most pressing interests, in comparison with truth, justice, humanity and the highest good of the peoples.\n\nNo individual rises to these heights except in intense moments, no society yet created satisfies this ideal. And in the present state of morality and of human development none perhaps can or ought to satisfy it. Nature will not allow it, Nature knows that it should not be. The first reason is that our moral ideals are themselves for the most part ill-evolved, ignorant and arbitrary, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental constructions</span> rather than transcriptions of the eternal truths of the spirit. Authoritative and dogmatic, they assert certain absolute standards in theory, but in practice every existing system of ethics proves either in application unworkable or is in fact a constant coming short of the absolute standard to which the ideal pretends. If our ethical system is a compromise<span class='page-number' id='s-199' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.199]</span> or a makeshift, it gives at once a principle of justification to the further sterilising compromises which society and the individual hasten to make with it. And if it insists on absolute love, justice, right with an uncompromising insistence, it soars above the head of human possibility and is professed with lip homage but ignored in practice. Even it is found that it ignores other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> in humanity which equally insist on survival but refuse to come within the moral formula. For just as the individual law of desire contains within it invaluable elements of the infinite whole which have to be protected against the tyranny of the absorbing social idea, the innate impulses too both of individual and of collective man contain in them invaluable elements which escape the limits of any ethical formula yet discovered and are yet necessary to the fullness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of an eventual divine perfection.\n\nMoreover, absolute love, absolute justice, absolute right reason in their present application by a bewildered and imperfect humanity come easily to be conflicting principles. Justice often demands what love abhors. Right reason dispassionately considering the facts of nature and human relations in search of a satisfying norm or rule is unable to admit without modification either any reign of absolute justice or any reign of absolute love. And in fact man's absolute justice easily turns out to be in practice a sovereign injustice; for his mind, one-sided and rigid in its constructions, puts forward a one-sided partial and rigorous scheme or figure and claims for it totality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absoluteness</span> and an application that ignores the subtler truth of things and the plasticity of life. All our standards turned into action either waver on a flux of compromises or err by this partiality and unelastic structure. Humanity sways from one orientation to another; the race moves upon a zigzag path led by conflicting claims and, on the whole, works out instinctively what Nature intends, but with much waste and suffering, rather than either what it desires or what it holds to be right or what the highest light from above demands from the embodied spirit.<span class='page-number' id='s-200' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.200]</span>\n\n---\n\nThe fact is that when we have reached the cult of absolute ethical qualities and erected the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>categorical imperative</span> of an ideal law, we have not come to the end of our search or touched the truth that delivers. There is, no doubt, something here that helps us to rise beyond <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> by the physical and vital man in us, an insistence that overpasses the individual and collective needs and desires of a humanity still bound to the living mud of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> in which it took its roots, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> that helps to develop the mental and moral being in us: this new sublimating element has been therefore an acquisition of great importance; its workings have marked a considerable step forward in the difficult evolution of terrestrial Nature. And behind the inadequacy of these ethical conceptions something too is concealed that does attach to a supreme Truth; there is here the glimmer of a light and power that are part of a yet unreached <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span>. But the mental idea of these things is not that light and the moral formulation of them is not that power. These are only representative constructions of the mind that cannot embody the divine spirit which they vainly endeavour to imprison in their categorical formulas. Beyond the mental and moral being in us is a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine being</span> that is spiritual and supramental; for it is only through a large spiritual plane where the mind's formulas dissolve in a white flame of direct inner experience that we can reach beyond mind and pass from its constructions to the vastness and freedom of the supramental realities. There alone can we touch the harmony of the divine powers that are poorly mispresented to our mind or framed into a false figure by the conflicting or wavering elements of the moral law. There alone the unification of the transformed vital and physical and the illumined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span> becomes possible in that supramental Spirit which is at once the secret source and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of our mind and life and body. There alone is there any possibility of an absolute justice, love and right—far other than that which we imagine—at one with each other in the light of a supreme divine knowledge. There alone can there be a reconciliation of the conflict between our members.\n\nIn other words there is, above society's external law and<span class='page-number' id='s-201' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.201]</span> man's moral law and beyond them, though feebly and ignorantly aimed at by something within them, a larger truth of a vast unbound consciousness, a law divine towards which both these blind and gross formulations are progressive faltering steps that try to escape from the natural law of the animal to a more exalted light or universal rule. That divine standard, since the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> in us is our spirit moving towards its own concealed perfection, must be a supreme spiritual law and truth of our nature. Again, as we are embodied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> in the world with a common existence and nature and yet individual souls capable of direct touch with the Transcendent, this supreme truth of ourselves must have a double character. It must be a law and truth that discovers the perfect movement, harmony, rhythm of a great spiritualised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective life</span> and determines perfectly our relations with each being and all beings in Nature's varied oneness. It must be at the same time a law and truth that discovers to us at each moment the rhythm and exact steps of the direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the Divine in the soul, mind, life, body of the individual creature.[^1] And we find in experience that this supreme light and force of action in its highest expression is at once an imperative law and an absolute freedom. It is an imperative law because it governs by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> Truth our every inner and outer movement. And yet at each moment and in each movement the absolute freedom of the Supreme handles the perfect plasticity of our conscious and liberated nature.\n\n[^1]: Therefore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> defines \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>\", an expression which means more than either religion or morality, as action controlled by our essential manner of self-being.\n\nThe ethical idealist tries to discover this supreme law in his own moral data, in the inferior powers and factors that belong to the mental and ethical formula. And to sustain and organise them he selects a fundamental principle of conduct essentially unsound and constructed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>–utility, hedonism, reason, intuitive conscience or any other generalised standard. All such efforts are foredoomed to failure. Our inner nature is the progressive expression of the eternal Spirit and too complex a power to be tied down by a single dominant mental or<span class='page-number' id='s-202' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.202]</span> moral principle. Only the supramental consciousness can reveal to its differing and conflicting forces their spiritual truth and harmonise their divergences.\n\nThe later religions endeavour to fix the type of a supreme truth of conduct, erect a system and declare God's law through the mouth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Avatar</span> or prophet. These systems, more powerful and dynamic than the dry ethical idea, are yet for the most part no more than idealistic glorifications of the moral principle sanctified by religious emotion and the label of a superhuman origin. Some, like the extreme Christian ethic, are rejected by Nature because they insist unworkably on an impracticable absolute rule. Others prove in the end to be evolutionary compromises and become obsolete in the march of Time. The true divine law, unlike these mental counterfeits, cannot be a system of rigid ethical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>determinations</span> that press into their cast-iron moulds all our life-movements. The Law divine is truth of life and truth of the spirit and must take up with a free living plasticity and inspire with the direct touch of its eternal light each step of our action and all the complexity of our life issues. It must act not as a rule and formula but as an enveloping and penetrating conscious presence that determines all our thoughts, activities, feelings, impulsions of will by its infallible power and knowledge.\n\nThe older religions erected their rule of the wise, their dicta of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Manu</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Confucius</span>, a complex Shastra in which they attempted to combine the social rule and moral law with the declaration of certain eternal principles of our highest nature in some kind of uniting amalgam. All three were treated on the same ground as equally the expression of everlasting verities, *sanātana dharma*. But two of these elements are evolutionary and valid for a time, mental constructions, human readings of the will of the Eternal; the third, attached and subdued to certain social and moral formulas, had to share the fortunes of its forms. Either the Shastra grows obsolete and has to be progressively changed or finally cast away or else it stands as a rigid barrier to the self-development of the individual and the race. The Shastra erects a collective and external standard; it ignores the inner nature of the individual, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>indeterminable</span><span class='page-number' id='s-203' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.203]</span> elements of a secret spiritual force within him. But the nature of the individual will not be ignored; its demand is inexorable. The unrestrained indulgence of his outer impulses leads to anarchy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span>, but the suppression and coercion of his soul's freedom by a fixed and mechanical rule spells stagnation or an inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>. Not this coercion or determination from outside, but the free discovery of his highest spirit and the truth of an eternal movement is the supreme thing that he has to discover.\n\nThe higher ethical law is discovered by the individual in his mind and will and psychic sense and then extended to the race. The supreme law also must be discovered by the individual in his spirit. Then only, through a spiritual influence and not by the mental idea, can it be extended to others. A moral law can be imposed as a rule or an ideal on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> of men who have not attained that level of consciousness or that fineness of mind and will and psychic sense in which it can become a reality to them and a living force. As an ideal it can be revered without any need of practice. As a rule it can be observed in its outsides even if the inner sense is missed altogether. The supramental and spiritual life cannot be mechanised in this way, it cannot be turned into a mental ideal or an external rule. It has its own great lines, but these must be made real, must be the workings of an active Power felt in the individual's consciousness and the transcriptions of an eternal Truth powerful to transform <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>. And because it is thus real, effective, imperative, the generalisation of the supramental consciousness and the spiritual life is the sole force that can lead to individual and collective perfection in earth's highest creatures. Only by our coming into constant touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Consciousness</span> and its absolute Truth can some form of the conscious Divine, the dynamic Absolute, take up our earth-existence and transform its strife, stumbling, sufferings and falsities into an image of the supreme Light, Power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.\n\nThe culmination of the soul's constant touch with the Supreme is that self-giving which we call surrender to the divine Will and immergence of the separated ego in the One who is all. A vast universality of soul and an intense unity with all is<span class='page-number' id='s-204' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.204]</span> the base and fixed condition of the supramental consciousness and spiritual life. In that universality and unity alone can we find the supreme law of the divine manifestation in the life of the embodied spirit; in that alone can we discover the supreme motion and right play of our individual nature. In that alone can all these lower discords resolve themselves into a victorious harmony of the true relations between manifested beings who are portions of the one Godhead and children of one universal Mother.\n\n---\n\nAll conduct and action are part of the movement of a Power, a Force infinite and divine in its origin and secret sense and will even though the forms of it we see seem inconscient or ignorant, material, vital, mental, finite, which is working to bring out progressively something of the Divine and Infinite in the obscurity of the individual and collective nature. This power is leading towards the Light, but still through the Ignorance. It leads man first through his needs and desires; it guides him next through enlarged needs and desires modified and enlightened by a mental and moral ideal. It is preparing to lead him to a spiritual realisation that overrides these things and yet fulfils and reconciles them in all that is divinely true in their spirit and purpose. It transforms the needs and desires into a divine Will and Ananda. It transforms the mental and moral aspiration into the powers of Truth and Perfection that are beyond them. It substitutes for the divided straining of the individual nature, for the passion and strife of the separate ego, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, profound, harmonious and happy law of the universalised person within us, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>central being</span>, the spirit that is a portion of the supreme Spirit. This true Person in us, because it is universal, does not seek its separate gratification but only asks in its outward expression in Nature its growth to its real stature, the expression of its inner divine self, that transcendent spiritual power and presence within it which is one with all and in sympathy with each thing and creature and with all the collective personalities and powers of the divine<span class='page-number' id='s-205' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.205]</span> existence, and yet it transcends them and is not bound by the egoism of any creature or collectivity or limited by the ignorant controls of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span>. This is the high realisation in front of all our seeking and striving, and it gives the sure promise of a perfect reconciliation and transmutation of all the elements of our nature. A pure, total and flawless action is possible only when that is effected and we have reached the height of this secret Godhead within us.\n\nThe perfect supramental action will not follow any single principle or limited rule. It is not likely to satisfy the standard either of the individual egoist or of any organised group-mind. It will conform to the demand neither of the positive practical man of the world nor of the formal moralist nor of the patriot nor of the sentimental philanthropist nor of the idealising philosopher. It will proceed by a spontaneous outflowing from the summits in the totality of an illumined and uplifted being, will and knowledge and not by the selected, calculated and standardised action which is all that the intellectual reason or ethical will can achieve. Its sole aim will be the expression of the divine in us and the keeping together of the world and its progress towards the Manifestation that is to be. This even will not be so much an aim and purpose as a spontaneous law of the being and an intuitive determination of the action by the Light of the divine Truth and its automatic influence. It will proceed like the action of Nature from a total will and knowledge behind her, but a will and knowledge enlightened in a conscious supreme Nature and no longer obscure in this ignorant Prakriti. It will be an action not bound by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span> but full and large in the spirit's impartial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of existence. The happy and inspired movement of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> and Wisdom guiding and impelling us will replace the perplexities and stumblings of the suffering and ignorant ego.\n\nIf by some miracle of divine intervention all mankind at once could be raised to this level, we should have something on earth like the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Golden Age</span> of the traditions, Satya Yuga, the Age of Truth or true existence. For the sign of the Satya Yuga is that the Law is spontaneous and conscious in each creature and does<span class='page-number' id='s-206' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.206]</span> its own works in a perfect harmony and freedom. Unity and universality, not separative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>, would be the foundation of the consciousness of the race; love would be absolute; equality would be consistent with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hierarchy</span> and perfect in difference; absolute justice would be secured by the spontaneous action of the being in harmony with the truth of things and the truth of himself and others and therefore sure of true and right result; right reason, no longer mental but supramental, would be satisfied not by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> of artificial standards but by the free automatic perception of right relations and their inevitable execution in the act. The quarrel between the individual and society or disastrous struggle between one community and another could not exist: the cosmic consciousness imbedded in embodied beings would assure a harmonious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> in oneness.\n\nIn the actual state of humanity, it is the individual who must climb to this height as a pioneer and precursor. His isolation will necessarily give a determination and a form to his outward activities that must be quite other than those of a consciously divine collective action. The inner state, the root of his acts, will be the same; but the acts themselves may well be very different from what they would be on an earth liberated from ignorance. Nevertheless his consciousness and the divine mechanism of his conduct, if such a word can be used of so free a thing, would be such as has been described, free from that subjection to vital impurity and desire and wrong impulse which we call sin, unbound by that rule of prescribed moral formulas which we call virtue, spontaneously sure and pure and perfect in a greater consciousness than the mind's, governed in all its steps by the light and truth of the Spirit. But if a collectivity or group could be formed of those who had reached the supramental perfection, there indeed some divine creation could take shape; a new earth could descend that would be a new heaven, a world of supramental light could be created here amidst the receding darkness of this terrestrial ignorance.<span class='page-number' id='s-207' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.207]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/standards-of-conduct-and-spiritual-freedom","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Supreme Will","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-supreme-will","prvt":"The Ascent of the Sacrifice - II","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-ascent-of-the-sacrifice-ii","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-supreme-will"],"t":"The Supreme Will","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"In the light of this progressive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of the Spirit, first apparently bound in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>, then free in the power and wisdom of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, we can better understand the great and crowning injunction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> to the Karmayogin, \"Abandoning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> dharmas, all principles and laws and rules of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>, take refuge in me alone.\" All standards and rules are temporary constructions founded upon the needs of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> in its transition from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> to Spirit.

In the spiritual life, or when a higher power than Mind has manifested and taken possession of the nature, these limited motive-forces recede, dwindle, tend to disappear. The spiritual or supramental Self, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Being</span>, the supreme and immanent Reality, must be alone the Lord within us and shape freely our final development according to the highest, widest, most integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> possible of the law of our nature. In the end that nature acts in the perfect Truth and its spontaneous freedom; for it obeys only the luminous power of the Eternal. The individual has nothing further to gain, no desire to fulfil; he has become a portion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span> or the universal personality of the Eternal. No other object than the manifestation and play of the Divine Spirit in life and the maintenance and conduct of the world in its march towards the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> can move him to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. Mental ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>, constructions are his no more; for his mind has fallen into silence, it is only a channel for the Light and Truth of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>. Ideals are too narrow for the vastness of his spirit; it is the ocean of the Infinite that flows through him and moves him for ever.\n\n---\n\nWhoever sincerely enters the path of works, must leave behind him the stage in which need and desire are the first law of our acts. For whatever <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> still trouble his being, he must, if he accepts the high aim of Yoga, put them away from him into the<span class='page-number' id='s-209' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.209]</span> hands of the Lord within us. The supreme Power will deal with them for the good of the sadhaka and for the good of all. In effect, we find that once this surrender is done,—always provided the rejection is sincere,—egoistic indulgence of desire may for some time recur under the continued impulse of past nature but only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to exhaust its acquired momentum and to teach the embodied being in his most unteachable part, his nervous, vital, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional nature</span>, by the reactions of desire, by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and unrest bitterly contrasted with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> periods of the higher peace or marvellous movements of divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, that egoistic desire is not a law for the soul that seeks <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> or aspires to its own original god-nature. Afterwards the element of desire in those impulsions will be thrown away or persistently eliminated by a constant denying and transforming pressure. Only the pure force of action in them (*pravṛtti*) justified by an equal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in all work and result that is inspired or imposed from above will be preserved in the happy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of a final perfection. To act, to enjoy is the normal law and right of the nervous being; but to choose by personal desire its action and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> is only its ignorant will, not its right. Alone the supreme and universal Will must choose; action must change into a dynamic movement of that Will; enjoyment must be replaced by the play of a pure spiritual Ananda. All personal will is either a temporary delegation from on high or a usurpation by the ignorant Asura.\n\nThe social law, that second term of our progress, is a means to which the ego is subjected in order that it may learn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> by subordination to a wider <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective ego</span>. This law may be quite empty of any moral content and may express only the needs or the practical good of the society as each society conceives it. Or it may express those needs and that good, but modified and coloured and supplemented by a higher moral or ideal law. It is binding on the developing but not yet perfectly developed individual in the shape of social <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span> obligation, communal or national demand, so long as it is not in conflict with his growing sense of the higher Right. But the sadhaka of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Karmayoga</span> will abandon this also to the Lord of works. After he has made this surrender, his social impulses and judgments will,<span class='page-number' id='s-210' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.210]</span> like his desires, only be used for their exhaustion or, it may be, so far as they are still necessary for a time to enable him to identify his lower mental nature with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> in general or with any grouping of mankind in its works and hopes and aspirations. But after that brief time is over, they will be withdrawn and a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> will alone abide. He will be identified with the Divine and with others only through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> and not through the mental nature.\n\nFor, even after he is free, the sadhaka will be in the world and to be in the world is to remain in works. But to remain in works without desire is to act for the good of the world in general or for the kind or the race or for some new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> to be evolved on the earth or some work imposed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span> within him. And this must be done either in the framework provided by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> or the grouping in which he is born or placed or else in one which is chosen or created for him by a divine direction. Therefore in our perfection there must be nothing left in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> which conflicts with or prevents our sympathy and free self-identification with the kind, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> or whatever collective expression of the Divine he is meant to lead, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> or serve. But in the end it must become a free self-identification through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> with the Divine and not a mental bond or moral tie of union or a vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> dominated by any kind of personal, social, national, communal or credal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span>. If any social law is obeyed, it will not be from physical necessity or from the sense of personal or general interest or for expediency or because of the pressure of the environment or from any sense of duty, but solely for the sake of the Lord of works and because it is felt or known to be the Divine Will that the social law or rule or relation as it stands can still be kept as a figure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> and the minds of men must not be disturbed by its infringement. If, on the other hand, the social law, rule or relation is disregarded, that too will not be for the indulgence of desire, personal will or personal opinion, but because a greater rule is felt that expresses the law of the Spirit or because it is known that there must be in the march of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All-Will</span> a movement towards the changing, exceeding or<span class='page-number' id='s-211' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.211]</span> abolition of existing laws and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> for the sake of a freer larger life necessary to the world's progress.\n\nThere is still left the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral law</span> or the ideal and these, even to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> who think themselves free, appear for ever sacred and intangible. But the sadhaka, his gaze turned always to the heights, will abandon them to Him whom all ideals seek imperfectly and fragmentarily to express; all moral qualities are only a poor and rigid travesty of his spontaneous and illimitable perfection. The bondage to sin and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> passes away with the passing of nervous desire; for it belongs to the quality of vital passion, impulsion or drive of propensity in us (*rajoguṇa*) and is extinguished with the transformation of that mode of Nature. But neither must the aspirant remain subject to the gilded or golden chain of a conventional or a habitual or a mentally ordered or even a high or clear sattwic virtue. That will be replaced by something profounder and more essential than the minor inadequate thing that men <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> virtue. The original sense of the word was manhood and this is a much larger and deeper thing than the moral mind and its structures. The culmination of Karmayoga is a yet higher and deeper state that may perhaps be called \"soulhood\",—for the soul is greater than the man; a free soulhood spontaneously welling out in works of a supreme Truth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span> will replace human virtue. But this supreme Truth cannot be forced to inhabit the petty edifices of the practical reason or even confined in the more dignified constructions of the larger ideative reason that imposes its representations as if they were pure truth on the limited human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. This supreme Love will not necessarily be consistent, much less will it be synonymous, with the partial and feeble, ignorant and emotion-ridden movements of human attraction, sympathy and pity. The petty law cannot bind the vaster movement; the mind's partial attainment cannot dictate its terms to the soul's supreme fulfilment.\n\nAt first, the higher Love and Truth will fulfil its movement in the sadhaka according to the essential law or way of his own nature. For that is the special aspect of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span>, the particular power of the supreme Shakti, out of which his soul has emerged into the Play, not limited indeed by the forms of this law<span class='page-number' id='s-212' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.212]</span> or way, for the soul is infinite. But still its stuff of nature bears that stamp, evolves fluently along those lines or turns around the spiral curves of that dominating influence. He will manifest the divine Truth-movement according to the temperament of the sage or the lion-like fighter or the lover and enjoyer or the worker and servant or in any combination of essential attributes (<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gunas</span>) that may constitute the form given to his being by its own inner urge. It is this self-nature playing freely in his acts which men will see in him and not a conduct cut, chalked out, artificially regulated, by any lesser rule or by any law from outside.\n\nBut there is a yet higher attainment, there is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> (*ānantya*) in which even this last <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> is exceeded, because the nature is utterly fulfilled and its boundaries vanish. There the soul lives without any boundaries; for it uses all forms and moulds according to the divine Will in it, but it is not restrained, it is not tied down, it is not imprisoned in any power or form that it uses. This is the summit of the path of works and this the utter liberty of the soul in its actions. In reality, it has there no actions; for all its activities are a rhythm of the Supreme and sovereignly proceed from That alone like a spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span> out of the Infinite.\n\n---\n\nThe total surrender, then, of all our actions to a supreme and universal Will, an unconditioned and standardless surrender of all works to the government of something eternal within us which will replace the ordinary working of the ego-nature, is the way and end of Karmayoga. But what is this divine supreme Will and how can it be recognised by our deluded instruments and our blind prisoned intelligence?\n\nOrdinarily, we conceive of ourselves as a separate \"I\" in the universe that governs a separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and mental and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral nature</span>, chooses in full liberty its own self-determined actions and is independent and therefore sole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of its works and responsible. It is not easy for the ordinary mind, the mind that has not thought nor looked deeply into its own constitution and<span class='page-number' id='s-213' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.213]</span> constituents, it is difficult even for minds that have thought but have no spiritual vision and experience, to imagine how there can be anything else in us truer, deeper and more powerful than this apparent \"I\" and its empire. But the very first step towards self-knowledge as towards the true knowledge of phenomena is to get behind the apparent truth of things and find the real but masked, essential and dynamic truth which their appearances cover.\n\nThis ego or \"I\" is not a lasting truth, much less our essential part; it is only a formation of Nature, a mental form of thought-centralisation in the perceiving and discriminating mind, a vital form of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centralisation</span> of feeling and sensation in our parts of life, a form of physical conscious reception centralising substance and function of substance in our bodies. All that we internally are is not ego, but consciousness, soul or spirit. All that we externally and superficially are and do is not ego but Nature. An executive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> force shapes us and dictates through our temperament and environment and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> so shaped, through our individualised formulation of the cosmic energies, our actions and their results. Truly, we do not think, will or act but thought occurs in us, will occurs in us, impulse and act occur in us; our ego-sense gathers around itself, refers to itself all this flow of natural activities. It is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Force</span>, it is Nature that forms the thought, imposes the will, imparts the impulse. Our body, mind and ego are a wave of that sea of force in action and do not govern it, but by it are governed and directed. The sadhaka in his progress towards truth and self-knowledge must come to a point where the soul opens its eyes of vision and recognises this truth of ego and this truth of works. He gives up the idea of a mental, vital, physical \"I\" that acts or governs action; he recognises that Prakriti, Force of cosmic nature following her fixed modes, is the one and only worker in him and in all things and creatures.\n\nBut what has fixed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of Nature</span>? Or who has originated and governs the movements of Force?

Prakriti shapes the action in us; Purusha in her or behind her witnesses, assents, bears and upholds it. Prakriti forms the thought in our minds; Purusha in her or behind her knows the thought and the truth in it. Prakriti determines the result of the action; Purusha in her or behind her enjoys or suffers the consequence. Prakriti forms mind and body, labours over them, develops them; Purusha upholds the formation and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> and sanctions each step of her works. Prakriti applies the Will-force which works in things and men; Purusha sets that Will-force to work by his vision of that which should be done. This Purusha is not the surface ego, but a silent Self, a source of Power, an originator and receiver of Knowledge behind the ego. Our mental \"I\" is only a false reflection of this Self, this Power, this Knowledge. This Purusha or supporting Consciousness is therefore the cause, recipient and support of all Nature's works, but he is not himself the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span>. Prakriti, Nature-Force, in front and Shakti, Conscious-Force, Soul-Force behind her,—for these two are the inner and outer faces of the universal Mother,—account for all that is done in the universe. The universal Mother, Prakriti-Shakti, is the one and only worker.\n\nPurusha-Prakriti, Consciousness-Force, Soul supporting Nature,—for the two even in their separation are one and inseparable,—are at once a universal and a transcendent Power. But there is something in the individual too which is not the mental ego, something that is one in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> with this greater reality: it is a pure reflection or portion of the one Purusha; it is the Soul Person or the embodied being, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jivatman</span>; it is the Self that seems to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> its power and knowledge so as to support an individual play of transcendent and universal Nature. In deepest reality the infinitely One is also infinitely multiple; we are not only a reflection or portion of That but we are That; our spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>—unlike our ego—does not preclude our universality and transcendence. But at present the soul or self in us intent on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individualisation</span> in Nature allows itself to be confused with the idea of the ego; it has to get rid of this ignorance, it has to know itself as a reflection or portion or being of the supreme and universal Self<span class='page-number' id='s-215' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.215]</span> and solely a centre of its consciousness in the world-action. But this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span> Purusha too is not the doer of works any more than the ego or the supporting consciousness of the Witness and Knower. Again and always it is the transcendent and universal Shakti who is the sole doer. But behind her is the one Supreme who manifests through her as the dual power, Purusha-Prakriti, Ishwara-Shakti.[^1] The Supreme becomes dynamic as the Shakti and is by her the sole originator and Master of works in the universe.\n\n[^1]: Ishwara-Shakti is not quite the same as Purusha-Prakriti; for Purusha and Prakriti are separate powers, but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> and Shakti contain each other. Ishwara is Purusha who contains Prakriti and rules by the power of the Shakti within him. Shakti is Prakriti ensouled by Purusha and acts by the will of the Ishwara which is her own will and whose presence in her movement she carries always with her. The Purusha-Prakriti realisation is of the first utility to the seeker on the Way of Works; for it is the separation of the conscient being and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Energy</span> and the subjection of the being to the mechanism of the Energy that are the efficient cause of our ignorance and imperfection; by this realisation the being can liberate himself from the mechanical action of the nature and become free and arrive at a first spiritual control over the nature. Ishwara-Shakti stands behind the relation of Purusha-Prakriti and its ignorant action and turns it to an evolutionary purpose. The Ishwara-Shakti realisation can bring participation in a higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dynamism</span> and a divine working and a total unity and harmony of the being in a spiritual nature.\n\n---\n\nIf this is the truth of works, the first thing the sadhaka has to do is to recoil from the egoistic forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and get rid of the sense of an \"I\" that acts. He has to see and feel that everything happens in him by the plastic conscious or subconscious or sometimes superconscious automatism of his mental and bodily instruments moved by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of spiritual, mental, vital and physical Nature. There is a personality on his surface that chooses and wills, submits and struggles, tries to make good in Nature or prevail over Nature, but this personality is itself a construction of Nature and so dominated, driven, determined by her that it cannot be free. It is a formation or expression of the Self in her,—it is a self of Nature rather than a self of Self, his natural and processive, not his spiritual and permanent being, a temporary constructed personality, not the<span class='page-number' id='s-216' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.216]</span> true immortal Person. It is that Person that he must become. He must succeed in being inwardly quiescent, detach himself as the observer from the outer active personality and learn the play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic forces</span> in him by standing back from all blinding absorption in its turns and movements. Thus calm, detached, a student of himself and a witness of his nature, he realises that he is the individual soul who observes the works of Nature, accepts tranquilly her results and sanctions or withholds his sanction from the impulse to her acts. At present this soul or Purusha is little more than an acquiescent spectator, influencing perhaps the action and development of the being by the pressure of its veiled consciousness, but for the most part delegating its powers or a fragment of them to the outer personality,—in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> to Nature, for this outer self is not lord but subject to her, *anīśa*; but, once unveiled, it can make its sanction or refusal effective, become the master of the action, dictate sovereignly a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>change of Nature</span>. Even if for a long time, as the result of fixed association and past storage of energy, the habitual movement takes place independent of the Purusha's assent and even if the sanctioned movement is persistently refused by Nature for want of past habit, still he will discover that in the end his assent or refusal prevails,—slowly with much resistance or quickly with a rapid accommodation of her means and tendencies she modifies herself and her workings in the direction indicated by his inner sight or volition. Thus he learns in place of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental control</span> or egoistic will an inner spiritual control which makes him master of the Nature-forces that work in him and not their unconscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> or mechanic slave. Above and around him is the Shakti, the universal Mother and from her he can get all his inmost soul needs and wills if only he has a true knowledge of her ways and a true surrender to the divine Will in her. Finally, he becomes aware of that highest dynamic Self within him and within Nature which is the source of all his seeing and knowing, the source of the sanction, the source of the acceptance, the source of the rejection. This is the Lord, the Supreme, the One-in-all, Ishwara-Shakti, of whom his soul is a portion, a being of that Being and a power of that Power. The<span class='page-number' id='s-217' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.217]</span> rest of our progress depends on our knowledge of the ways in which the Lord of works manifests his Will in the world and in us and executes them through the transcendent and universal Shakti.\n\nThe Lord sees in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>omniscience</span> the thing that has to be done. This seeing is his Will, it is a form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative Power</span>, and that which he sees the all-conscious Mother, one with him, takes into her dynamic self and embodies, and executive Nature-Force carries it out as the mechanism of their omnipotent omniscience. But this vision of what is to be and therefore of what is to be done arises out of the very being, pours directly out of the consciousness and delight of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of the Lord, spontaneously, like light from the Sun. It is not our mortal attempt to see, our difficult arrival at truth of action and motive or just demand of Nature. When the individual soul is entirely at one in its being and knowledge with the Lord and directly in touch with the original Shakti, the transcendent Mother, the supreme Will can then arise in us too in the high divine manner as a thing that must be and is achieved by the spontaneous action of Nature. There is then no desire, no responsibility, no reaction; all takes place in the peace, calm, light, power of the supporting and enveloping and inhabiting Divine.\n\nBut even before that highest approach to identity is achieved, something of the supreme Will can manifest in us as an imperative impulsion, a God-driven action; we then act by a spontaneous self-determining Force but a fuller knowledge of meaning and aim arises only afterwards. Or the impulse to action may come as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> or intuition, but rather in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and body than in the mind; here an effective sight enters in but the complete and exact knowledge is still deferred and comes, if at all, later. But the divine Will may descend too as a luminous single command or a total perception or a continuous current of perception of what is to be done into the will or into the thought or as a direction from above spontaneously fulfilled by the lower members. When the Yoga is imperfect, only some actions can be done in this way, or else a general action may so proceed but only during periods of exaltation and illumination. When the<span class='page-number' id='s-218' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.218]</span> Yoga is perfect, all action becomes of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. We may indeed distinguish three stages of a growing progress by which, first, the personal will is occasionally or frequently enlightened or moved by a supreme Will or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious Force</span> beyond it, then constantly replaced and, last, identified and merged in that divine Power-action. The first is the stage when we are still governed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, heart and senses; these have to seek or wait for the divine inspiration and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> and do not always find or receive it. The second is the stage when human intelligence is more and more replaced by a high illumined or intuitive spiritualised mind, the external human heart by the inner psychic heart, the senses by a purified and selfless vital force. The third is the stage when we rise even above spiritualised mind to the supramental levels.\n\nIn all three stages the fundamental character of the liberated action is the same, a spontaneous working of Prakriti no longer through or for the ego but at the will and for the enjoyment of the supreme Purusha. At a higher level this becomes the Truth of the absolute and universal Supreme expressed through the individual soul and worked out consciously through the nature,—no longer through a half-perception and a diminished or distorted effectuation by the stumbling, ignorant and all-deforming energy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> in us but by the all-wise transcendent and universal Mother.\n\nThe Lord has veiled himself and his absolute wisdom and eternal consciousness in ignorant Nature-Force and suffers her to drive the individual being, with its complicity, as the ego; this lower action of Nature continues to prevail, often even in spite of man's half-lit imperfect efforts at a nobler motive and a purer self-knowledge. Our human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> at perfection fails, or progresses very incompletely, owing to the force of Nature's past actions in us, her past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span>, her long-rooted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span>; it turns towards a true and high-climbing success only when a greater Knowledge and Power than our own breaks through the lid of our ignorance and guides or takes up our personal will. For our human will is a misled and wandering ray that has parted from the supreme Puissance. The period of slow emergence out of this lower working into a higher light and<span class='page-number' id='s-219' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.219]</span> purer force is the valley of the shadow of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> for the striver after perfection; it is a dreadful passage full of trials, sufferings, sorrows, obscurations, stumblings, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span>, pitfalls. To abridge and alleviate this ordeal or to penetrate it with the divine delight faith is necessary, an increasing surrender of the mind to the knowledge that imposes itself from within and, above all, a true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and a right and unfaltering and sincere practice. \"Practise unfalteringly,\" says the Gita, \"with a heart free from despondency,\" the Yoga; for even though in the earlier stage of the path we drink deep of the bitter poison of internal discord and suffering, the last taste of this cup is the sweetness of the nectar of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> and the honey-wine of an eternal Ananda.<span class='page-number' id='s-220' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.220]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-supreme-will","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"Equality and the Annihilation of Ego","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/equality-and-the-annihilation-of-ego","prvt":"Standards of Conduct and Spiritual Freedom","prvu":"/cwsa/23/standards-of-conduct-and-spiritual-freedom","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["equality-and-the-annihilation-of-ego"],"t":"Equality and the Annihilation of Ego","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"An entire self-consecration, a complete equality, an unsparing effacement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, a transforming deliverance of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> from its ignorant modes of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> are the steps by which the surrender of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> and nature to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> Will can be prepared and achieved,—a self-giving true, total and without reserve.

It is that which we conceive as the thing that should be done. And whether it be shaped by our sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>, by our feeling for our fellow-creatures, by our idea of what is for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of others or the good of the world or by the direction of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> whom we accept as a human Master, wiser than ourselves and for us the representative of that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of all works in whom we believe but whom we do not yet know, the principle is the same.

We need not be discouraged when we find him lurking within us and assuming all sorts of disguises, but we should be vigilant to detect him in all his masks and inexorable in expelling his influence. The illumining Word of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is the decisive line of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, \"To action thou hast a right but never under any circumstances to its fruit.\" The fruit belongs solely to the Lord of all works; our only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> with it is to prepare success by a true and careful action and to offer it, if it comes, to the divine Master. Afterwards even as we have renounced attachment to the fruit, we must renounce attachment to the work also; at any moment we must be prepared to change one work, one course or one field of action for another or abandon all works if that is the clear command of the Master. Otherwise we do the act not for his sake but for our satisfaction and pleasure in the work, from the kinetic nature's need of action or for the fulfilment of our propensities; but these are all stations and refuges of the ego. However necessary for our ordinary motion of life, they have to be abandoned in the growth of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and replaced by divine counterparts: an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> and God-directed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> will cast out or supplant the unillumined vital satisfaction and pleasure, a joyful driving of the Divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Energy</span> the kinetic need; the fulfilment of the propensities will no longer be an object or a necessity, there will be instead the fulfilment of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span> through the natural dynamic truth in action of a free soul and a luminous nature.

For the worship of the Master of works demands a clear recognition and glad acknowledgment of him in ourselves, in all things and in all happenings. Equality is the sign of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span>; it is the soul's ground on which true sacrifice and worship can be done.

We must hate none, despise none, be repelled by none; for in all we have to see the One disguised or manifested at his pleasure. He is a little revealed in one or more revealed in another or concealed and wholly distorted in others according to his will and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of what is best for that which he intends to become in form in them and to do in works in their nature. All is ourself, one self that has taken <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> shapes. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hatred</span> and disliking and scorn and repulsion, clinging and attachment and preference are natural, necessary, inevitable at a certain stage: they attend upon or they <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to make and maintain Nature's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> in us. But to the Karmayogin they are a survival, a stumbling-block, a process of the Ignorance and, as he progresses, they fall away from his nature. The child-soul needs them for its growth; but they drop from an adult in the divine culture. In the God-nature to which we have to rise there can be an adamantine, even a destructive severity but not hatred, a divine irony but not scorn, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, clear-seeing and forceful rejection but not repulsion and dislike. Even what we have to destroy, we must not abhor or fail to recognise as a disguised and temporary movement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>.\n\nAnd since all things are the one Self in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>, we<span class='page-number' id='s-223' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.223]</span> shall have equality of soul towards the ugly and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span>, the maimed and the perfect, the noble and the vulgar, the pleasant and the unpleasant, the good and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>. Here also there will be no hatred, scorn and repulsion, but instead the equal eye that sees all things in their real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and their appointed place. For we shall know that all things express or disguise, develop or distort, as best they can or with whatever defect they must, under the circumstances intended for them, in the way possible to the immediate status or function or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of their nature, some truth or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, some energy or potential of the Divine necessary by its presence in the progressive manifestation both to the whole of the present sum of things and for the perfection of the ultimate result. That truth is what we must seek and discover behind the transitory <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>; undeterred by appearances, by the deficiencies or the disfigurements of the expression, we can then worship the Divine for ever unsullied, pure, beautiful and perfect behind his masks. All indeed has to be changed, not ugliness accepted but divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, not imperfection taken as our resting-place but perfection striven after, the supreme good made the universal aim and not evil. But what we do has to be done with a spiritual understanding and knowledge, and it is a divine good, beauty, perfection, pleasure that has to be followed after, not the human standards of these things. If we have not equality, it is a sign that we are still pursued by the Ignorance, we shall truly understand nothing and it is more than likely that we shall destroy the old imperfection only to create another: for we are substituting the appreciations of our human mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> for the divine values.\n\nEquality does not mean a fresh ignorance or blindness; it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> for and need not initiate a greyness of vision and a blotting out of all hues. Difference is there, variation of expression is there and this variation we shall appreciate,—far more justly than we could when the eye was clouded by a partial and erring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and hate, admiration and scorn, sympathy and antipathy, attraction and repulsion. But behind the variation we shall always see the Complete and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Immutable</span> who dwells within it and we shall feel, know or at least, if it is<span class='page-number' id='s-224' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.224]</span> hidden from us, trust in the wise purpose and divine necessity of the particular manifestation, whether it appear to our human standards harmonious and perfect or crude and unfinished or even false and evil.\n\nAnd so too we shall have the same equality of mind and soul towards all happenings, painful or pleasurable, defeat and success, honour and disgrace, good repute and ill-repute, good <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span> and evil fortune. For in all happenings we shall see the will of the Master of all works and results and a step in the evolving expression of the Divine. He manifests himself, to those who have the inner eye that sees, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> and their play and results as well as in things and in creatures. All things move towards a divine event; each experience, suffering and want no less than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and satisfaction, is a necessary link in the carrying out of a universal movement which it is our business to understand and second. To revolt, to condemn, to cry out is the impulse of our unchastened and ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>. Revolt like everything else has its uses in the play and is even necessary, helpful, decreed for the divine development in its own time and stage; but the movement of an ignorant rebellion belongs to the stage of the soul's childhood or to its raw adolescence. The ripened soul does not condemn but seeks to understand and master, does not cry out but accepts or toils to improve and perfect, does not revolt inwardly but labours to obey and fulfil and transfigure. Therefore we shall receive all things with an equal soul from the hands of the Master. Failure we shall admit as a passage as calmly as success until the hour of the divine victory arrives. Our souls and minds and bodies will remain unshaken by acutest sorrow and suffering and pain if in the divine dispensation they come to us, unoverpowered by intensest joy and pleasure. Thus supremely balanced we shall continue steadily on our way meeting all things with an equal calm until we are ready for a more exalted status and can enter into the supreme and universal Ananda.<span class='page-number' id='s-225' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.225]</span>\n\n---\n\nThis equality cannot come except by a protracted ordeal and patient self-discipline; so long as desire is strong, equality cannot come at all except in periods of quiescence and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span> of desire, and it is then more likely to be an inert indifference or desire's recoil from itself than the true calm and the positive spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. Moreover, this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> or this growth into equality of spirit has its necessary epochs and stages. Ordinarily we have to begin with a period of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span>; for we must learn to confront, to suffer and to assimilate all contacts. Each fibre in us must be taught not to wince away from that which pains and repels and not to run eagerly towards that which pleases and attracts, but rather to accept, to face, to bear and to conquer. All touches we must be strong to bear, not only those that are proper and personal to us but those born of our sympathy or our conflict with the worlds around, above or below us and with their peoples. We shall endure tranquilly the action and impact on us of men and things and forces, the pressure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span> and the assaults of Titans; we shall face and engulf in the unstirred seas of our spirit all that can possibly come to us down the ways of the soul's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> experience. This is the stoical period of the preparation of equality, its most elementary and yet its heroic age. But this steadfast endurance of the flesh and heart and mind must be reinforced by a sustained sense of spiritual submission to a divine Will: this living clay must yield not only with a stern or courageous acquiescence, but with knowledge or with resignation, even in suffering, to the touch of the divine Hand that is preparing its perfection. A sage, a devout or even a tender stoicism of the God-lover is possible, and these are better than the merely pagan self-reliant endurance which may lend itself to a too great hardening of the vessel of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>: for this kind prepares the strength that is capable of wisdom and of love; its tranquillity is a deeply moved calm that passes easily into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>. The gain of this period of resignation and endurance is the soul's strength equal to all shocks and contacts.\n\nThere is next a period of high-seated impartiality and indifference in which the soul becomes free from exultation and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span> and escapes from the snare of the eagerness of joy as<span class='page-number' id='s-226' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.226]</span> from the dark net of the pangs of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and suffering. All things and persons and forces, all thoughts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and sensations and actions, one's own no less than those of others, are regarded from above by a spirit that remains intact and immutable and is not disturbed by these things. This is the philosophic period of the preparation of equality, a wide and august movement. But indifference must not settle into an inert turning away from action and experience; it must not be an aversion born of weariness, disgust and distaste, a recoil of disappointed or satiated desire, the sullenness of a baffled and dissatisfied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> forced back from its passionate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>. These recoils come inevitably in the unripe soul and may in some way help the progress by a discouragement of the eager desire-driven vital nature, but they are not the perfection towards which we labour. The indifference or the impartiality that we must seek after is a calm superiority of the high-seated soul above the contacts of things;[^1] it regards and accepts or rejects them but is not moved in the rejection and is not subjected by the acceptance. It begins to feel itself near, kin to, one with a silent Self and Spirit self-existent and separate from the workings of Nature which it supports and makes possible, part of or merged in the motionless calm Reality that transcends the motion and action of the universe. The gain of this period of high transcendence is the soul's peace unrocked and unshaken by the pleasant ripplings or by the tempestuous waves and billows of the world's movement.\n\n[^1]: *udāsīna.*\n\nIf we can pass through these two stages of the inner change without being arrested or fixed in either, we are admitted to a greater divine equality which is capable of a spiritual ardour and tranquil passion of delight, a rapturous, all-understanding and all-possessing equality of the perfected soul, an intense and even wideness and fullness of its being embracing all things. This is the supreme period and the passage to it is through the joy of a total self-giving to the Divine and to the universal Mother. For strength is then crowned by a happy mastery, peace deepens into bliss, the possession of the divine calm is uplifted<span class='page-number' id='s-227' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.227]</span> and made the ground for the possession of the divine movement. But if this greater perfection is to arrive, the soul's impartial high-seatedness looking down from above on the flux of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and personalities and movements and forces must be modified and change into a new sense of strong and calm submission and a powerful and intense surrender. This submission will be no longer a resigned acquiescence but a glad acceptance: for there will be no sense of suffering or of the bearing of a burden or cross; love and delight and the joy of self-giving will be its brilliant texture. And this surrender will be not only to a divine Will which we perceive and accept and obey, but to a divine Wisdom in the Will which we recognise and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Love</span> in it which we feel and rapturously suffer, the wisdom and love of a supreme Spirit and Self of ourselves and all with which we can achieve a happy and perfect unity. A lonely power, peace and stillness is the last word of the philosophic equality of the sage; but the soul in its integral experience liberates itself from this self-created status and enters into the sea of a supreme and all-embracing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of the beginningless and endless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span> of the Eternal. Then we are at last capable of receiving all contacts with a blissful equality, because we feel in them the touch of the imperishable Love and Delight, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> absolute that hides ever in the heart of things. The gain of this culmination in a universal and equal rapture is the soul's delight and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> gates of the Bliss that is infinite, the Joy that surpasses all understanding.\n\n---\n\nBefore this labour for the annihilation of desire and the conquest of the soul's equality can come to its absolute perfection and fruition, that turn of the spiritual movement must have been completed which leads to the abolition of the sense of ego. But for the worker the renunciation of the egoism of action is the most important element in this change. For even when by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> up the fruits and the desire of the fruits to the Master of the Sacrifice we have parted with the egoism of rajasic desire, we<span class='page-number' id='s-228' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.228]</span> may still have kept the egoism of the worker. Still we are subject to the sense that we are ourselves the doer of the act, ourselves its source and ourselves the giver of the sanction. It is still the \"I\" that chooses and determines, it is still the \"I\" that undertakes the responsibility and feels the demerit or the merit.\n\nAn entire removal of this separative ego-sense is an essential aim of our Yoga. If any ego is to remain in us for a while, it is only a form of it which knows itself to be a form and is ready to disappear as soon as a true centre of consciousness is manifested or built in us. That true centre is a luminous formulation of the one Consciousness and a pure channel and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Existence</span>. A support for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> manifestation and action of the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Force</span>, it gradually reveals behind it the true Person in us, the central eternal being, an everlasting being of the Supreme, a power and portion of the transcendent Shakti.[^2]\n\n[^2]: *aṁśaḥ sanātanaḥ, parā prakṛtir jīvabhūtā.*\n\nHere too, in this movement by which the soul divests itself gradually of the obscure robe of the ego, there is a progress by marked stages. For not only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fruit of works</span> belongs to the Lord alone, but our works also must be his; he is the true lord of our actions no less than of our results. This we must not see with the thinking mind only, it must become entirely true to our entire consciousness and will. The sadhaka has not only to think and know but to see and feel concretely and intensely even in the moment of the working and in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> and whole process that his works are not his at all, but are coming through him from the Supreme Existence. He must be always aware of a Force, a Presence, a Will that acts through his individual nature. But there is in taking this turn the danger that he may confuse his own disguised or sublimated ego or an inferior power with the Lord and substitute its demands for the supreme dictates. He may fall into a common ambush of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> and distort his supposed surrender to a higher Power into an excuse for a magnified and uncontrolled indulgence of his own self-will and even of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and passions. A great sincerity is asked for and has to be imposed not only on the conscious mind but<span class='page-number' id='s-229' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.229]</span> still more on the subliminal part of us which is full of hidden movements. For there is there, especially in our subliminal vital nature, an incorrigible charlatan and actor. The sadhaka must first have advanced far in the elimination of desire and in the firm equality of his soul towards all workings and all happenings before he can utterly lay down the burden of his works on the Divine. At every moment he must proceed with a vigilant eye upon the deceits of the ego and the ambushes of the misleading Powers of Darkness who ever represent themselves as the one Source of Light and Truth and take on them a simulacrum of divine forms in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to capture the soul of the seeker.\n\nImmediately he must take the further step of relegating himself to the position of the Witness. Aloof from the Prakriti, impersonal and dispassionate, he must watch the executive Nature-Force at work within him and understand its action; he must learn by this separation to recognise the play of her universal forces, distinguish her interweaving of light and night, the divine and the undivine, and detect her formidable Powers and Beings that use the ignorant human creature. Nature works in us, says the Gita, through the triple quality of Prakriti, the quality of light and good, the quality of passion and desire and the quality of obscurity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>. The seeker must learn to distinguish, as an impartial and discerning witness of all that proceeds within this kingdom of his nature, the separate and the combined action of these qualities; he must pursue the workings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> forces in him through all the labyrinth of their subtle unseen processes and disguises and know every intricacy of the maze. As he proceeds in this knowledge, he will be able to become the giver of the sanction and no longer remain an ignorant tool of Nature. At first he must induce the Nature-Force in its action on his instruments to subdue the working of its two lower qualities and bring them into subjection to the quality of light and good and, afterwards, he must persuade that again to offer itself so that all three may be transformed by a higher Power into their divine equivalents, supreme repose and calm, divine illumination and bliss, the eternal divine dynamis, Tapas. The first part of this discipline and change can be firmly<span class='page-number' id='s-230' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.230]</span> done in principle by the will of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> in us; but its full execution and the subsequent transformation can be done only when the deeper psychic soul increases its hold on the nature and replaces the mental being as its ruler. When this happens, he will be ready to make, not only with an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and intention and an initial and progressive self-abandonment but with the most intense actuality of dynamic self-giving, the complete renunciation of his works to the Supreme Will. By degrees his mind of an imperfect human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> will be replaced by a spiritual and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illumined mind</span> and that can in the end enter into the supramental Truth-Light; he will then no longer act from his nature of the Ignorance with its three modes of confused and imperfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, but from a diviner nature of spiritual calm, light, power and bliss. He will act not from an amalgam of an ignorant mind and will with the drive of a still more ignorant heart of emotion and the desire of the life-being and the urge and instinct of the flesh, but first from a spiritualised self and nature and, last, from a supramental Truth-consciousness and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine force</span> of supernature.\n\nThus are made possible the final steps when the veil of Nature is withdrawn and the seeker is face to face with the Master of all existence and his activities are merged in the action of a supreme Energy which is pure, true, perfect and blissful for ever. Thus can he utterly renounce to the supramental Shakti his works as well as the fruits of his works and act only as the conscious instrument of the eternal Worker. No longer giving the sanction, he will rather receive in his instruments and follow in her hands a divine mandate. No longer doing works, he will accept their execution through him by her unsleeping Force.

Therefore without a long inner experience, without intimate self-observation and intuitive perception of the Nature-forces it is difficult to grasp accurately or firmly utilise. Still certain broad indications may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the seeker on the Way of Works to understand, analyse and control by his assent or refusal the combinations of his own nature. These modes are termed in the Indian books qualities, *guṇas*, and are given the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> *sattva, rajas, tamas*. Sattwa is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of equilibrium and translates in quality as good and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> and light; rajas is the force of kinesis and translates in quality as struggle and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, passion and action; tamas is the force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> and translates in quality<span class='page-number' id='s-232' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.232]</span> as obscurity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> and inaction. Ordinarily used for psychological self-analysis, these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> are valid also in physical Nature. Each thing and every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in the lower Prakriti contains them and its process and dynamic form are the result of the interaction of these qualitative powers.\n\nEvery form of things, whether animate or inanimate, is a constantly maintained poise of natural forces in motion and is subject to an unending stream of helpful, disturbing or disintegrating contacts from other combinations of forces that surround it. Our own nature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> is nothing else than such a formative combination and poise. In the reception of the environing contacts and the reaction to them the three modes determine the temper of the recipient and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the response. Inert and inapt, he may suffer them without any responsive reaction, any motion of self-defence or any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>assimilation</span> and adjustment; this is the mode of tamas, the way of inertia. The stigmata of tamas are blindness and unconsciousness and incapacity and unintelligence, sloth and indolence and inactivity and mechanical routine and the mind's torpor and the life's sleep and the soul's slumber. Its effect, if uncorrected by other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>, can be nothing but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> of the form or the poise of the nature without any new creation or new equilibrium or force of kinetic progress. At the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of this inert impotence is the principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and an inability or slothful unwillingness to comprehend, seize and manage the stimulating or assailing contact, the suggestion of environing forces and their urge towards fresh experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the recipient of Nature's contacts, touched and stimulated, solicited or assailed by her forces, may react to the pressure or against it. She allows, encourages, impels him to strive, to resist, to attempt, to dominate or engross his environment, to assert his will, to fight and create and conquer. This is the mode of rajas, the way of passion and action and the thirst of desire. Struggle and change and new creation, victory and defeat and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and suffering and hope and disappointment are its children and build the many-coloured house of life in which it takes its pleasure. But its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> is an imperfect<span class='page-number' id='s-233' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.233]</span> or a false knowledge and brings with it ignorant effort, error, a constant misadjustment, pain of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span>, disappointed desire, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> of loss and failure. The gift of rajas is kinetic force, energy, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, the power that creates and acts and can overcome; but it moves in the wrong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> or the half-lights of the Ignorance and it is perverted by the touch of the Asura, Rakshasa and Pishacha. The arrogant ignorance of the human mind and its self-satisfied perversions and presumptuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span>, the pride and vanity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cruelty</span> and tyranny and beast wrath and violence, the selfishness and baseness and hypocrisy and treachery and vile meanness, the lust and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>greed</span> and rapacity, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>jealousy</span>, envy and bottomless ingratitude that disfigure the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span> are the natural children of this indispensable but strong and dangerous turn of Nature.\n\nBut the embodied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> is not limited to these two modes of Prakriti; there is a better and more enlightened way in which he can deal with surrounding impacts and the stream of the world-forces. There is possible a reception and reaction with clear comprehension, poise and balance. This way of natural being has the power that, because it understands, sympathises; it fathoms and controls and develops Nature's urge and her ways: it has an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> that penetrates her processes and her significances and can assimilate and utilise; there is a lucid response that is not overpowered but adjusts, corrects, adapts, harmonises, elicits the best in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> things. This is the mode of sattwa, the turn of Nature that is full of light and poise, directed to good, to knowledge, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, to happiness, right understanding, right equilibrium, right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>: its temperament is the opulence of a bright clearness of knowledge and a lucent warmth of sympathy and closeness. A fineness and enlightenment, a governed energy, an accomplished harmony and poise of the whole being is the consummate achievement of the sattwic nature.\n\nNo existence is cast entirely in the single mould of any of these three modes of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> Force; all three are present in everyone and everywhere. There is a constant combining and separation of their shifting relations and interpenetrating<span class='page-number' id='s-234' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.234]</span> influences, often a conflict, a wrestling of forces, a struggle to dominate each other. All have in great or in small extent or degree, even if sometimes in a hardly appreciable minimum, their sattwic states and clear tracts or inchoate tendencies of light, clarity and happiness, fine adaptation and sympathy with the environment, intelligence, poise, right mind, right will and feeling, right impulse, virtue, order. All have their rajasic moods and impulses and turbid parts of desire and passion and struggle, perversion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> and error, unbalanced joy and sorrow, aggressive push to work and eager creation and strong or bold or fiery or fierce reactions to the pressure of the environment and to life's assaults and offers. All have their tamasic states and constant obscure parts, their moments or points of unconsciousness, their long habit or their temporary velleities of weak resignation or dull acceptance, their constitutional feeblenesses or movements of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span>, negligence and indolence and their lapses into ignorance and incapacity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> and cowardly recoil or submission to the environment and to the pressure of men and events and forces. Each <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of us is sattwic in some directions of his energy of Nature or in some parts of his mind or character, in others rajasic, tamasic in others. According as one or other of the modes usually dominates his general temperament and type of mind and turn of action, it is said of him that he is the sattwic, the rajasic or the tamasic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>; but few are always of one kind and none is entire in his kind. The wise are not always or wholly wise, the intelligent are intelligent only in patches; the saint suppresses in himself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> unsaintly movements and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> are not entirely evil: the dullest has his unexpressed or unused and undeveloped capacities, the most timorous his moments or his way of courage, the helpless and the weakling a latent part of strength in his nature. The dominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gunas</span> are not the essential soul-type of the embodied being but only the index of the formation he has made for this life or during his present existence and at a given moment of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> in Time.<span class='page-number' id='s-235' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.235]</span>\n\n---\n\nWhen the sadhaka has once stood back from the action of Prakriti within him or upon him and, not interfering, not amending or inhibiting, not choosing or deciding, allowed its play and analysed and watched the process, he soon discovers that her modes are self-dependent and work as a machine once put in action works by its own structure and propelling forces. The force and the propulsion come from Prakriti and not from the creature. Then he realises how mistaken was his impression that his mind was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> of his works; his mind was only a small part of him and a creation and engine of Nature. Nature was acting all the while in her own modes moving the three general qualities about as a girl might play with her puppets. His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> was all along a tool and plaything; his character and intelligence, his moral qualities and mental powers, his creations and works and exploits, his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span> and forbearance, his cruelty and mercy, his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, his sin and his virtue, his light and his darkness, his passion of joy and his anguish of sorrow were the play of Nature to which the soul, attracted, won and subjected, lent its passive concurrence. And yet the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>determinism</span> of Nature or Force is not all; the soul has a word to say in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>,—but the secret soul, the Purusha, not the mind or the ego, since these are not independent entities, they are parts of Nature. For the soul's sanction is needed for the play and by an inner silent will as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> and giver of the sanction it can determine the principle of the play and intervene in its combinations, although the execution in thought and will and act and impulse must still be Nature's part and privilege. The Purusha can dictate a harmony for Nature to execute, not by interfering in her functions but by a conscious regard on her which she transmutes at once or after much difficulty into translating idea and dynamic impetus and significant figure.\n\nAn escape from the action of the two inferior gunas is very evidently indispensable if we are to transmute our present nature into a power and form of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of its forces. Tamas obscures and prevents the light of the divine knowledge from penetrating into the dark and dull corners of our nature. Tamas incapacitates and takes<span class='page-number' id='s-236' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.236]</span> away the power to respond to divine impulse and the energy to change and the will to progress and make ourselves plastic to a greater Shakti. Rajas perverts knowledge, makes our reason the accomplice of falsehood and the abettor of every wrong movement, disturbs and twists our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> and its impulses, oversets the balance and health of the body. Rajas captures all high-born ideas and high-seated movements and turns them to a false and egoistic use; even divine Truth and divine influences, when they descend into the earthly plane, cannot escape this misuse and seizure. Tamas unenlightened and rajas unconverted, no divine change or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine life</span> is possible.\n\nAn exclusive resort to sattwa would seem to be the way of escape: but there is this difficulty that no one of the qualities can prevail by itself against its two companions and rivals. If, envisaging the quality of desire and passion as the cause of disturbance, suffering, sin and sorrow, we strain and labour to quell and subdue it, rajas sinks but tamas rises. For, the principle of activity dulled, inertia takes its place. A quiet peace, happiness, knowledge, love, right sentiment can be founded by the principle of light, but, if rajas is absent or completely suppressed, the quiet in the soul tends to become a tranquillity of inaction, not the firm ground of a dynamic change. Ineffectively right-thinking, right-doing, good, mild and even, the nature may become in its dynamic parts sattwa-tamasic, neutral, pale-tinted, uncreative or emptied of power. Mental and moral obscurity may be absent, but so are the intense springs of action, and this is a hampering <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and another kind of incompetence. For tamas is a double principle; it contradicts rajas by inertia, it contradicts sattwa by narrowness, obscurity and ignorance and, if either is depressed, it pours in to occupy its place.\n\nIf we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in rajas again to correct this error and bid it ally itself to sattwa and by their united agency endeavour to get rid of the dark principle, we find that we have elevated our action, but that there is again subjection to rajasic eagerness, passion, disappointment, suffering, anger. These movements may be more exalted in their scope and spirit and action than before, but they are not the peace, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, the power, the self-mastery<span class='page-number' id='s-237' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.237]</span> at which we long to arrive. Wherever desire and ego harbour, passion and disturbance harbour with them and share their life. And if we seek a compromise between the three modes, sattwa leading, the others subordinate, still we have only arrived at a more temperate action of the play of Nature. A new poise has been reached, but a spiritual freedom and mastery are not in sight or else are still only a far-off prospect.\n\nA radically different movement has to draw us back from the gunas and lift us above them. The error that accepts the action of the modes of Nature must cease; for as long as it is accepted, the soul is involved in their operations and subjected to their law. Sattwa must be transcended as well as rajas and tamas; the golden chain must be broken no less than the leaden fetters and the bond-ornaments of a mixed alloy. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> prescribes to this end a new method of self-discipline. It is to stand back in oneself from the action of the modes and observe this unsteady flux as the Witness seated above the surge of the forces of Nature. He is one who watches but is impartial and indifferent, aloof from them on their own level and in his native posture high above them. As they rise and fall in their waves, the Witness looks, observes, but neither accepts nor for the moment interferes with their course. First there must be the freedom of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> Witness; afterwards there can be the control of the Master, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>.\n\n---\n\nThe initial advantage of this process of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span> is that one begins to understand one's own nature and all Nature. The detached Witness is able to see entirely without the least blinding by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> the play of her modes of the Ignorance and to pursue it into all its ramifications, coverings and subtleties—for it is full of camouflage and disguise and snare and treachery and ruse. Instructed by long experience, conscious of all act and condition as their interaction, made wise of their processes, he cannot any longer be overcome by their assaults, surprised in their nets or deceived by their disguises. At the same time he perceives the ego<span class='page-number' id='s-238' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.238]</span> to be nothing better than a device and the sustaining knot of their interaction and, perceiving it, he is delivered from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of the lower egoistic Nature. He escapes from the sattwic egoism of the altruist and the saint and the thinker; he shakes off from its control on his life-impulses the rajasic egoism of the self-seeker and ceases to be the laborious caterer of self-interest and the pampered prisoner or toiling galley-slave of passion and desire; he slays with the light of knowledge the tamasic egoism of the ignorant or passive being, dull, unintelligent, attached to the common round of human life. Thus convinced and conscious of the essential vice of the ego-sense in all our personal action, he seeks no longer to find a means of self-correction and self-liberation in the rajasic or sattwic ego but looks above, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the instruments and the working of Nature, to the Master of works alone and his supreme Shakti, the supreme Prakriti. There alone all the being is pure and free and the rule of a divine Truth possible.\n\nIn this progression the first step is a certain detached superiority to the three modes of Nature. The soul is inwardly separated and free from the lower Prakriti, not involved in its coils, indifferent and glad above it. Nature continues to act in the triple round of her ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span>,—desire, grief and joy attack the heart, the instruments fall into inaction and obscurity and weariness, light and peace come back into the heart and mind and body; but the soul stands unchanged and untouched by these changes. Observing and unmoved by the grief and desire of the lower members, smiling at their joys and their strainings, regarding and unoverpowered by the failing and the darknesses of the thought and the wildness or the weaknesses of the heart and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span>, uncompelled and unattached to the mind's illuminations and its relief and sense of ease or of power in the return of light and gladness, it throws itself into none of these things, but waits unmoved for the intimations of a higher Will and the intuitions of a greater luminous knowledge. Thus doing always, it becomes eventually free even in its nature parts from the strife of the three modes and their insufficient values and imprisoning limits. For now this lower Prakriti feels progressively a compulsion from a higher Shakti. The old habits to which it<span class='page-number' id='s-239' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.239]</span> clung receive no further sanction and begin steadily to lose their frequency and force of recurrence. At last it understands that it is called to a higher action and a better state and, however slowly, however reluctantly, with whatever initial or prolonged ill-will and stumbling ignorance, it submits, turns and prepares itself for the change.\n\nThe static freedom of the soul, no longer witness only and knower, is crowned by a dynamic transformation of the nature. The constant mixture, the uneven operation of the three modes acting upon each other in our three instruments ceases from its normal confused, troubled and improper action and movement. Another action becomes possible, commences, grows, culminates, a working more truly right, more luminous, natural and normal to the deepest divine interplay of Purusha and Prakriti although supernatural and supernormal to our present imperfect nature. The body conditioning the physical mind insists no longer on its tamasic inertia that repeats always the same ignorant movement: it becomes a passive field and instrument of a greater force and light, it responds to every demand of the spirit's force, holds and supports every variety and intensity of new divine experience. Our kinetic and dynamic vital parts, our nervous and emotional and sensational and volitional being, expand in power and admit a tireless action and a blissful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of experience, but learn at the same time to stand on a foundation of wide self-possessed and self-poised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, sublime in force, divine in rest, neither exulting and excited nor tortured by sorrow and pain, neither harried by desire and importunate impulses nor dulled by incapacity and indolence. The intelligence, the thinking, understanding and reflective mind, renounces its sattwic limitations and opens to an essential light and peace. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> knowledge offers to us its splendid ranges, a knowledge not made up of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental constructions</span>, not bound by opinion and idea or dependent on a stumbling uncertain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> and the petty support of the senses, but self-sure, authentic, all-penetrating, all-comprehending; a boundless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> and peace, not dependent on deliverance from the hampered strenuousness of creative energy and dynamic action, not constituted by a<span class='page-number' id='s-240' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.240]</span> few limited felicities but self-existent and all-including, pour into ever-enlarging fields and through ever-widening and always more numerous channels to possess the nature. A higher force, bliss and knowledge from a source beyond mind and life and body seize on them to remould in a diviner image.\n\nHere the disharmonies of the triple mode of our inferior existence are overpassed and there begins a greater triple mode of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span>. There is no obscurity of tamas or inertia. Tamas is replaced by a divine peace and tranquil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> repose out of which is released from a supreme matrix of calm <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> the play of action and knowledge. There is no rajasic kinesis, no desire, no joyful and sorrowful striving of action, creation and possession, no fruitful chaos of troubled impulse. Rajas is replaced by a self-possessed power and illimitable act of force, that even in its most violent intensities does not shake the immovable poise of the soul or stain the vast and profound <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> and luminous abysses of its peace. There is no constructing light of mind casting about to seize and imprison the Truth, no insecure or inactive ease. Sattwa is replaced by an illumination and a spiritual bliss <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> with the depth and infinite existence of the soul and instinct with a direct and authentic knowledge that springs straight from the veiled glories of the secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Omniscience</span>.\n\nThis is the greater consciousness into which our inferior consciousness has to be transformed, this nature of the Ignorance with its unquiet unbalanced activity of the three modes changed into this greater luminous supernature. At first we become free from the three gunas, detached, untroubled, *nistraiguṇya*; but this is the recovery of the native state of the soul, the self, the spirit free and watching in its motionless calm the motion of Prakriti in her force of the Ignorance. If on this basis the nature, the motion of Prakriti, is also to become free, it must be by a quiescence of action in a luminous peace and silence in which all necessary movements are done without any conscious reaction or participation or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> of action by the mind or by the life-being, without any ripple of thought or eddy of the vital parts: it must be done under the impulsion, by the initiation, by the<span class='page-number' id='s-241' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.241]</span> working of an impersonal cosmic or a transcendent Force. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Mind</span>, Life, Substance must act, or a pure transcendent Self-Power and Bliss other than our own personal being or its building of Nature. This is a state of freedom which can come in the Yoga of works through renunciation of ego and desire and personal initiation and the surrender of the being to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Self</span> or to the universal Shakti; it can come in the Yoga of knowledge by the cessation of thought, the silence of the mind, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of the whole being to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Consciousness</span>, to the cosmic Self, the cosmic Dynamis or to the supreme Reality; it can come in the Yoga of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> by the surrender of the heart and the whole nature into the hands of the All-Blissful as the adored Master of our existence. But the culminating change intervenes by a more positive and dynamic transcendence: there is a transference or transmutation into a superior spiritual status, *triguṇātīta*, in which we participate in a greater spiritual dynamisation; for the three lower unequal modes pass into an equal triune mode of eternal calm, light and force, the repose, kinesis, illumination of the divine Nature.\n\nThis supreme harmony cannot come except by the cessation of egoistic will and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> and act and the quiescence of our limited intelligence. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> ego must cease to strive, the mind fall silent, the desire-will learn not to initiate. Our personality must join its source and all thought and initiation come from above. The secret Master of our activities will be slowly unveiled to us and from the security of the supreme Will and Knowledge give the sanction to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> who will do all works in us with a purified and exalted nature for her instrument; the individual centre of personality will be only the upholder of her works here, their recipient and channel, the reflector of her power and luminous participator in her light, joy and force. Acting it will not act and no reaction of the lower Prakriti will touch it. The transcendence of the three modes of Nature is the first condition, their transformation the decisive step of this change by which the Way of Works climbs out of the pit of narrowness of our darkened <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span> into the unwalled wideness of the Truth and Light above us.<span class='page-number' id='s-242' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.242]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-three-modes-of-nature","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Master of the Work","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-master-of-the-work","prvt":"Equality and the Annihilation of Ego","prvu":"/cwsa/23/equality-and-the-annihilation-of-ego","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-master-of-the-work"],"t":"The Master of the Work","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> and Mover of our works is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span>, the Universal and Supreme, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>.

All that is is he, and he is the More than all that is, and we ourselves, though we know it not, are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> of his being, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of his force, conscious with a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> derived from his; even our mortal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> is made out of his substance and there is an immortal within us that is a spark of the Light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> that are for ever.

The Master of the work does not reveal himself at once to the seeker. Always it is his Power that acts behind the veil, but it is manifest only when we renounce the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> of the worker, and its direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> increases in proportion as that renunciation becomes more and more complete. Only when our surrender to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> Shakti is absolute, shall we have the right to live in his absolute presence. And only then can we see our work throw itself naturally, completely and simply into the mould of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-243' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.243]</span>\n\nThere must, therefore, be stages and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> in our approach to this perfection, as there are in the progress towards all other perfection on any plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>. The vision of the full glory may come to us before, suddenly or slowly, once or often, but until the foundation is complete, it is a summary and concentrated, not a durable and all-enveloping experience, not a lasting presence. The amplitudes, the infinite contents of the Divine Revelation come afterwards and unroll gradually their power and their significance. Or, even, the steady vision can be there on the summits of our nature, but the perfect response of the lower members comes only by degrees. In all Yoga the first requisites are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and patience. The ardours of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and the violences of the eager will that seek to take the kingdom of heaven by storm can have miserable reactions if they disdain to support their vehemence on these humbler and quieter auxiliaries. And in the long and difficult <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> there must be an integral faith and an unshakable patience.\n\nIt is difficult to acquire or to practise this faith and steadfastness on the rough and narrow path of Yoga because of the impatience of both heart and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and the eager but soon faltering will of our rajasic nature. The vital nature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> hungers always for the fruit of its labour and, if the fruit appears to be denied or long delayed, he loses faith in the ideal and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. For his mind judges always by the appearance of things, since that is the first ingrained habit of the intellectual reason in which he so inordinately trusts. Nothing is easier for us than to accuse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in our hearts when we suffer long or stumble in the darkness or to abjure the ideal that we have set before us. For we say, \"I have trusted to the Highest and I am betrayed into suffering and sin and error.\" Or else, \"I have staked my whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> on an idea which the stern facts of experience contradict and discourage. It would have been better to be as other men are who accept their limitations and walk on the firm ground of normal experience.\" In such moments—and they are sometimes frequent and long—all the higher experience is forgotten and the heart concentrates itself in its own bitterness. It is in these dark passages that it is possible to fall for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> or to turn back from the divine labour.<span class='page-number' id='s-244' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.244]</span>\n\nIf one has walked long and steadily in the path, the faith of the heart will remain under the fiercest adverse pressure; even if it is concealed or apparently overborne, it will take the first opportunity to re-emerge. For something higher than either heart or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> upholds it in spite of the worst stumblings and through the most prolonged failure. But even to the experienced sadhaka such falterings or overcloudings bring a retardation of his progress and they are exceedingly dangerous to the novice. It is therefore necessary from the beginning to understand and accept the arduous difficulty of the path and to feel the need of a faith which to the intellect may seem blind, but yet is wiser than our reasoning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. For this faith is a support from above; it is the brilliant shadow thrown by a secret light that exceeds the intellect and its data; it is the heart of a hidden knowledge that is not at the mercy of immediate appearances. Our faith, persevering, will be justified in its works and will be lifted and transfigured at last into the self-revelation of a divine knowledge. Always we must adhere to the injunction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, \"Yoga must be continually applied with a heart free from despondent sinking.\" Always we must repeat to the doubting intellect the promise of the Master, \"I will surely deliver thee from all sin and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>; do not grieve.\" At the end, the flickerings of faith will cease; for we shall see his face and feel always the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Presence</span>.\n\n---\n\nThe Master of our works respects our nature even when he is transforming it; he works always through the nature and not by any arbitrary caprice. This imperfect nature of ours contains the materials of our perfection, but inchoate, distorted, misplaced, thrown together in disorder or a poor imperfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>. All this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> has to be patiently perfected, purified, reorganised, new-moulded and transformed, not hacked and hewn and slain or mutilated, not obliterated by simple coercion and denial. This world and we who live in it are his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>, and he deals with it and us in a way our narrow<span class='page-number' id='s-245' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.245]</span> and ignorant mind cannot understand unless it falls silent and opens to a divine knowledge. In our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> is the substance of a truth which labours to reveal its meaning to our groping intelligence. The human intellect cuts out the error and the truth with it and replaces it by another half-truth half-error; but the Divine Wisdom suffers our mistakes to continue until we are able to arrive at the truth hidden and protected under every false cover. Our sins are the misdirected steps of a seeking Power that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>, not at sin, but at perfection, at something that we might <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a divine virtue. Often they are the veils of a quality that has to be transformed and delivered out of this ugly disguise: otherwise, in the perfect providence of things, they would not have been suffered to exist or to continue. The Master of our works is neither a blunderer nor an indifferent witness nor a dallier with the luxury of unneeded evils. He is wiser than our reason and wiser than our virtue.\n\nOur nature is not only mistaken in will and ignorant in knowledge but weak in power; but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Force</span> is there and will lead us if we trust in it and it will use our deficiencies and our powers for the divine purpose. If we fail in our immediate aim, it is because he has intended the failure; often our failure or ill-result is the right road to a truer issue than an immediate and complete success would have put in our reach. If we suffer, it is because something in us has to be prepared for a rarer possibility of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>. If we stumble, it is to learn in the end the secret of a more perfect walking. Let us not be in too furious a haste to acquire even peace, purity and perfection. Peace must be ours, but not the peace of an empty or devastated nature or of slain or mutilated capacities incapable of unrest because we have made them incapable of intensity and fire and force. Purity must be our aim, but not the purity of a void or of a bleak and rigid coldness. Perfection is demanded of us, but not the perfection that can exist only by confining its scope within narrow limits or putting an arbitrary full stop to the ever self-extending scroll of the Infinite. Our object is to change into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>, but the divine nature is not a mental or moral but a spiritual condition, difficult to achieve, difficult even to conceive by our<span class='page-number' id='s-246' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.246]</span> intelligence. The Master of our work and our Yoga knows the thing to be done, and we must allow him to do it in us by his own means and in his own manner.\n\nThe movement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span> is egoistic at its core and nothing is more difficult for us than to get rid of egoism while yet we admit personality and adhere to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> in the half-light and half-force of our unfinished nature. It is easier to starve the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> by renouncing the impulse to act or to kill it by cutting away from us all movement of personality. It is easier to exalt it into self-forgetfulness immersed in a trance of peace or an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Love</span>. But our more difficult problem is to liberate the true Person and attain to a divine manhood which shall be the pure vessel of a divine force and the perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span>. Step after step has to be firmly taken; difficulty after difficulty has to be entirely experienced and entirely mastered. Only the Divine Wisdom and Power can do this for us and it will do all if we yield to it in an entire faith and follow and assent to its workings with a constant courage and patience.\n\nThe first step on this long path is to consecrate all our works as a sacrifice to the Divine in us and in the world; this is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the mind and heart, not too difficult to initiate, but very difficult to make absolutely sincere and all-pervasive. The second step is to renounce <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to the fruit of our works; for the only true, inevitable and utterly desirable fruit of sacrifice—the one thing needful—is the Divine Presence and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Consciousness</span> and Power in us, and if that is gained, all else will be added. This is a transformation of the egoistic will in our vital being, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> and desire-nature, and it is far more difficult than the other. The third step is to get rid of the central egoism and even the ego-sense of the worker. That is the most difficult transformation of all and it cannot be perfectly done if the first two steps have not been taken; but these first steps too cannot be completed unless the third comes in to crown the movement and, by the extinction of egoism, eradicates the very origin of desire. Only when the small ego-sense is rooted out from the nature can the seeker know his true person that stands above as a portion and power of the Divine<span class='page-number' id='s-247' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.247]</span> and renounce all motive-force other than the will of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span>.\n\n---\n\nThere are gradations in this last integralising movement; for it cannot be done at once or without long approaches that bring it progressively nearer and make it at last possible. The first attitude to be taken is to cease to regard ourselves as the worker and firmly to realise that we are only one instrument of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Force</span>. At first it is not the one Force but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span></span> that seem to move us; but these may be turned into feeders of the ego and this vision liberates the mind but not the rest of the nature. Even when we become aware of all as the working of one cosmic Force and of the Divine behind it, that too need not liberate. If the egoism of the worker disappears, the egoism of the instrument may replace it or else prolong it in a disguise. The life of the world has been full of instances of egoism of this kind and it can be more engrossing and enormous than any other; there is the same danger in Yoga. A man becomes a leader of men or eminent in a large or lesser circle and feels himself full of a power that he knows to be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> his own ego-force; he may be aware of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span> acting through him or a Will mysterious and unfathomable or a Light within of great brilliance. There are extraordinary results of his thoughts, his actions or his creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>. He effects some tremendous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> that clears the path for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> or some great construction that becomes its momentary resting-place. He is a scourge or he is a bringer of light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>healing</span>, a creator of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> or a messenger of knowledge. Or, if his work and its effects are on a lesser scale and have a limited field, still they are attended by the strong sense that he is an instrument and chosen for his mission or his labour. Men who have this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> and these powers come easily to believe and declare themselves to be mere instruments in the hand of God or of Fate: but even in the declaration we can see that there can intrude or take refuge an intenser and more exaggerated egoism than ordinary men have the courage to assert or the strength to<span class='page-number' id='s-248' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.248]</span> house within them. And often if men of this kind speak of God, it is to erect an image of him which is really nothing but a huge shadow of themselves or their own nature, a sustaining Deific <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Essence</span> of their own type of will and thought and quality and force. This magnified image of their ego is the Master whom they serve. This happens only too often in Yoga to strong but crude vital natures or minds too easily exalted when they allow <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span>, pride or the desire of greatness to enter into their spiritual seeking and vitiate its purity of motive; a magnified ego stands between them and their true being and grasps for its own personal purpose the strength from a greater unseen Power, divine or undivine, acting through them of which they become vaguely or intensely aware. An intellectual perception or vital sense of a Force greater than ours and of ourselves as moved by it is not sufficient to liberate from the ego.\n\nThis perception, this sense of a greater Power in us or above and moving us, is not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hallucination</span> or a megalomania. Those who thus feel and see have a larger sight than ordinary men and have advanced a step beyond the limited physical intelligence, but theirs is not the plenary vision or the direct experience. For, because they are not clear in mind and aware in the soul, because their awakening is more in the vital parts than into the spiritual substance of Self, they cannot be the conscious instruments of the Divine or come face to face with the Master, but are used through their fallible and imperfect nature. The most they see of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> is a Fate or a cosmic Force or else they give his name to a limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span> or, worse, to a Titanic or demoniac Power that veils him. Even certain religious founders have erected the image of the God of a sect or a national God or a Power of terror and punishment or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Numen</span> of sattwic love and mercy and virtue and seem not to have seen the One and Eternal. The Divine accepts the image they make of him and does his work in them through that medium, but, since the one Force is felt and acts in their imperfect nature but more intensely than in others, the motive principle of egoism too can be more intense in them than in others. An exalted rajasic or sattwic ego still holds them and stands between them and the integral Truth. Even this is<span class='page-number' id='s-249' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.249]</span> something, a beginning, although far from the true and perfect experience. A much worse thing may befall those who break something of the human bonds but have not purity and have not the knowledge, for they may become instruments, but not of the Divine; too often, using his name, they serve unconsciously his Masks and black Contraries, the Powers of Darkness.\n\nOur nature must house the cosmic Force but not in its lower aspect or in its rajasic or sattwic movement; it must serve the universal Will, but in the light of a greater liberating knowledge. There must be no egoism of any kind in the attitude of the instrument, even when we are fully conscious of the greatness of the Force within us. Every man is knowingly or unknowingly the instrument of a universal Power and, apart from the inner Presence, there is no such essential difference between one action and another, one kind of instrumentation and another as would warrant the folly of an egoistic pride. The difference between knowledge and ignorance is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of the Spirit; the breath of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> blows where it lists and fills today one and tomorrow another with the word or the puissance. If the potter shapes one pot more perfectly than another, the merit lies not in the vessel but the maker. The attitude of our mind must not be \"This is my strength\" or \"Behold God's power in me\", but rather \"A Divine Power works in this mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and it is the same that works in all men and in the animal, in the plant and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metal</span>, in conscious and living things and in things apparently inconscient and inanimate.\" This large view of the One working in all and of the whole world as the equal instrument of a divine action and gradual self-expression, if it becomes our entire experience, will <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to eliminate all rajasic egoism out of us and even the sattwic ego-sense will begin to pass away from our nature.\n\nThe elimination of this form of ego leads straight towards the true instrumental action which is the essence of a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Karmayoga</span>. For while we cherish the instrumental ego, we may pretend to ourselves that we are conscious instruments of the Divine, but in reality we are trying to make of the Divine Shakti an instrument of our own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> or our egoistic purpose. And<span class='page-number' id='s-250' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.250]</span> even if the ego is subjected but not eliminated, we may indeed be engines of the Divine Work, but we shall be imperfect tools and deflect or impair the working by our mental errors, our vital distortions or the obstinate incapacities of our physical nature. If this ego disappears, then we can truly become, not only pure instruments consciously consenting to every turn of the divine Hand that moves us, but aware of our true nature, conscious portions of the one Eternal and Infinite put out in herself for her works by the supreme Shakti.\n\n---\n\nThere is another greater step to be taken after the surrender of our instrumental ego to the Divine Shakti. It is not enough to know her as the one Cosmic Force that moves us and all creatures on the planes of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and matter</span>; for this is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower Nature</span> and, although the Divine Knowledge, Light, Power are there concealed and at work in this Ignorance and can break partly its veil and manifest something of their true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> or descend from above and uplift these inferior workings, yet, even if we realise the One in a spiritualised mind, a spiritualised life-movement, a spiritualised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body-consciousness</span>, an imperfection remains in the dynamic parts. There is a stumbling response to the Supreme Power, a veil over the face of the Divine, a constant mixture of the Ignorance. It is only when we open to the Divine Shakti in the truth of her Force which transcends this lower Prakriti that we can be perfect instruments of her power and knowledge.\n\nNot only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> but perfection must be the aim of the Karmayoga. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine works</span> through our nature and according to our nature; if our nature is imperfect, the work also will be imperfect, mixed, inadequate. Even it may be marred by gross errors, falsehoods, moral weaknesses, diverting influences. The work of the Divine will be done in us even then, but according to our weakness, not according to the strength and purity of its source. If ours were not an integral Yoga, if we sought only the liberation of the self within us or the motionless existence<span class='page-number' id='s-251' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.251]</span> of Purusha separated from Prakriti, this dynamic imperfection might not matter. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Calm</span>, untroubled, not depressed, not elated, refusing to accept the perfection or imperfection, fault or merit, sin or virtue as ours, perceiving that it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of Nature</span> working in the field of her modes that make this mixture, we could withdraw into the silence of the spirit and, pure, untouched, witness only the workings of Prakriti. But in an integral realisation this can only be a step on the way, not our last resting-place. For we aim at the divine realisation not only in the immobility of the Spirit, but also in the movement of Nature. And this cannot be altogether until we can feel the presence and power of the Divine in every step, motion, figure of our activities, in every turn of our will, in every thought, feeling and impulse. No doubt, we can feel that in essence even in the nature of the Ignorance, but it is the divine Power and Presence in a disguise, a diminution, an inferior figure. Ours is a greater demand, that our nature shall be a power of the Divine in the Truth of the Divine, in the Light, in the force of the eternal self-conscient Will, in the wideness of the sempiternal Knowledge.\n\nAfter the removal of the veil of ego, the removal of the veil of Nature and her inferior modes that govern our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>. As soon as the limits of the ego begin to fade, we see how that veil is constituted and detect the action of cosmic Nature in us, and in or behind cosmic Nature we sense the presence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Self</span> and the dynamis of the world-pervading <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>. The Master of the instrument stands behind all this working, and even within the working there is his touch and the drive of a great guiding or disposing Influence. It is no longer ego or ego-force that we serve; we obey the World-Master and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolutionary impulse</span>. At each step we can say in the language of the Sanskrit verse, \"Even as I am appointed by Thee seated in my heart, so, O <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>, I act.\" But still this action may be of two very different kinds, one only illumined, the other transformed and uplifted into a greater supernature. For we may keep on in the way of action upheld and followed by our nature when by her and her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of egoism we were \"turned as if mounted on a machine,\" but now with a perfect<span class='page-number' id='s-252' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.252]</span> understanding of the mechanism and its utilisation for his world purposes by the Master of works whom we feel behind it. This is indeed as far as even many great Yogis have reached on the levels of spiritualised mind; but it need not be so always, for there is a greater supramental possibility. It is possible to rise beyond spiritualised mind and to act spontaneously in the living presence of the original divine Truth-Force of the Supreme Mother. Our motion one with her motion and merged in it, our will one with her will, our energy absolved in her energy, we shall feel her working through us as the Divine manifest in a supreme Wisdom-Power, and we shall be aware of the transformed mind, life and body only as the channels of a supreme Light and Force beyond them, infallible in its steps because transcendent and total in its knowledge. Of this Light and Force we shall not only be the recipients, channels, instruments, but become a part of it in a supreme uplifted abiding experience.\n\nAlready, before we reach this last perfection, we can have the union with the Divine in works in its extreme wideness, if not yet on its most luminous heights; for we perceive no longer merely Nature or the modes of Nature, but become conscious, in our physical movements, in our nervous and vital reactions, in our mental workings, of a Force greater than body, mind and life which takes hold of our limited instruments and drives all their motion. There is no longer the sense of ourselves moving, thinking or feeling but of that moving, feeling and thinking in us. This force that we feel is the universal Force of the Divine, which, veiled or unveiled, acting directly or permitting the use of its powers by beings in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>, is the one Energy that alone exists and alone makes universal or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> action possible. For this force is the Divine itself in the body of its power; all is that, power of act, power of thought and knowledge, power of mastery and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span>, power of love. Conscious always and in everything, in ourselves and in others, of the Master of Works possessing, inhabiting, enjoying through this Force that is himself, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> through it all existences and all happenings, we shall have arrived at the divine union through works and achieved by that fulfilment in works all that others have gained<span class='page-number' id='s-253' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.253]</span> through absolute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> or through pure knowledge. But there is still another step that calls us, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> out of this cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> into the identity of the Divine Transcendence.\n\nThe Master of our works and our being is not merely a Godhead here within us, nor is he merely a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Spirit</span> or some kind of universal Power. The world and the Divine are not one and the same thing, as a certain kind of pantheistic thinking would like to believe. The world is an emanation; it depends upon something that manifests in it but is not limited by it: the Divine is not here alone; there is a Beyond, an eternal Transcendence. The individual being also in its spiritual part is not a formation in the cosmic existence—our ego, our mind, our life, our body are that; but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> spirit, the imperishable soul in us has come out of the Transcendence.\n\n---\n\nA Transcendent who is beyond all world and all Nature and yet possesses the world and its nature, who has descended with something of himself into it and is shaping it into that which as yet it is not, is the Source of our being, the Source of our works and their Master. But the seat of the Transcendent Consciousness is above in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absoluteness</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Existence</span>—and there too is the absolute Power, Truth, Bliss of the Eternal—of which our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> can form no conception and of which even our greatest spiritual experience is only a diminished reflection in the spiritualised mind and heart, a faint shadow, a thin derivate. Yet proceeding from it there is a sort of golden corona of Light, Power, Bliss and Truth—a divine Truth-Consciousness as the ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystics</span> called it, a Supermind, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gnosis</span>, with which this world of a lesser consciousness proceeding by Ignorance is in secret relation and which alone maintains it and prevents it from falling into a disintegrated chaos. The powers we are now satisfied to call gnosis, intuition or illumination are only fainter <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> of which that is the full and flaming source, and between the highest human intelligence and it there lie many levels of ascending consciousness, highest mental or overmental, which<span class='page-number' id='s-254' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.254]</span> we would have to conquer before we arrived there or could bring down its greatness and glory here. Yet, however difficult, that ascent, that victory is the destiny of the human spirit and that luminous descent or bringing down of the divine Truth is the inevitable term of the troubled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span>; that intended consummation is its *raison d'être*, our culminating state and the explanation of our terrestrial existence. For though the transcendental Divine is already here as the Purushottama in the secret heart of our mystery, he is veiled by many coats and disguises of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> world-wide Yoga-Maya; it is only by the ascent and victory of the Soul here in the body that the disguises can fall away and the dynamis of the supreme Truth replace this tangled weft of half-truth that becomes creative error, this emergent Knowledge that is converted by its plunge into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span> of Matter and its slow partial return towards itself into an effective Ignorance.\n\nFor here in the world, though the Gnosis is there secretly behind existence, what acts is not the Gnosis but a magic of Knowledge-Ignorance, an incalculable yet apparently mechanical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Overmind</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. The Divine appears to us here in one view as an equal, inactive and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> Witness Spirit, an immobile consenting Purusha not bound by quality or Space or Time, whose support or sanction is given impartially to the play of all action and energies which the transcendent Will has once permitted and authorised to fulfil themselves in the cosmos. This Witness Spirit, this immobile Self in things, seems to will nothing and determine nothing; yet we become aware that his very passivity, his silent presence compels all things to travel even in their ignorance towards a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> and attracts through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> towards a yet unrealised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. Yet no supreme infallible Divine Will seems to be there, only a widely deployed Cosmic Energy or a mechanical executive Process, Prakriti. This is one side of the cosmic Self; the other presents itself as a universal Divine, one in being, multiple in personality and power, who conveys to us, when we enter into the consciousness of his universal forces, a sense of infinite quality and will and act and worldwide knowledge and a one yet innumerable delight; for through<span class='page-number' id='s-255' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.255]</span> him we become one with all existences not only in their essence but in their play of action, see ourself in all and all in ourself, perceive all knowledge and thought and feeling as motions of the one Mind and Heart, all energy and action as kinetics of the one Will in power, all Matter and form as particles of the one Body, all personalities as projections of the one Person, all egos as deformations of the one and sole real \"I\" in existence. In him we no longer stand separate, but lose our active ego in the universal movement, even as by the Witness who is without qualities and for ever unattached and unentangled, we lose our static ego in the universal peace.\n\nAnd yet there remains a contradiction between these two terms, the aloof divine Silence and the all-embracing divine Action, which we may heal in ourselves in a certain manner, in a certain high degree which seems to us complete, yet is not complete because it cannot altogether transform and conquer. A universal Peace, Light, Power, Bliss is ours, but its effective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> is not that of the Truth-Consciousness, the divine Gnosis, but still, though wonderfully freed, uplifted and illumined, supports only the present self-expression of the Cosmic Spirit and does not transform, as would a transcendental Descent, the ambiguous symbols and veiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysteries</span> of a world of Ignorance. Ourselves are free, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-consciousness</span> remains in bondage; only a further transcendental ascent and descent can entirely heal the contradiction and transform and deliver.\n\nFor there is yet a third intensely close and personal aspect of the Master of Works which is a key to his sublimest hidden mystery and ecstasy; for he detaches from the secret of the hidden Transcendence and the ambiguous display of the cosmic Movement an individual Power of the Divine that can mediate between the two and bridge our passage from the one to the other. In this aspect the transcendent and universal person of the Divine conforms itself to our individualised personality and accepts a personal relation with us, at once identified with us as our supreme Self and yet close and different as our Master, Friend, Lover, Teacher, our Father and our Mother, our Playmate<span class='page-number' id='s-256' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.256]</span> in the great world-game who has disguised himself throughout as friend and enemy, helper and opponent and, in all relations and in all workings that affect us, has led our steps towards our perfection and our release. It is through this more personal manifestation that we are admitted to some possibility of the complete transcendental experience; for in him we meet the One not merely in a liberated calm and peace, not merely with a passive or active submission in our works or through the mystery of union with a universal Knowledge and Power filling and guiding us, but with an ecstasy of divine Love and divine Delight that shoots up beyond silent Witness and active World-Power to some positive divination of a greater beatific secret. For it is not so much knowledge leading to some ineffable Absolute, not so much works lifting us beyond world-process to the originating supreme Knower and Master, but rather this thing most intimate to us, yet at present most obscure, which keeps for us wrapped in its passionate veil the deep and rapturous secret of the transcendent Godhead and some absolute positiveness of its perfect Being, its all-concentrating Bliss, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.\n\nBut the individual relation with the Divine does not always or from the beginning bring into force a widest enlargement or a highest self-exceeding. At first this Godhead close to our being or immanent within us can be felt fully only in the scope of our personal nature and experience, a Leader and Master, a Guide and Teacher, a Friend and Lover, or else a spirit, power or presence, constituting and uplifting our upward and enlarging movement by the force of his intimate reality inhabiting the heart or presiding over our nature from above even our highest intelligence. It is our personal evolution that is his preoccupation, a personal relation with him that is our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and fulfilment, the building of our nature into his divine image that is our self-finding and perfection. The outside world seems to exist only as a field for this growth and a provider of materials or of helping and opposing forces for its successive stages. Our works done in that world are his works, but even when they serve some temporary universal end, their main purpose for us is to make outwardly dynamic or give inward power to our relations with<span class='page-number' id='s-257' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.257]</span> this immanent Divine. Many seekers ask for no more or see the continuation and fulfilment of this spiritual flowering only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> beyond; the union is consummated and made perpetual in an eternal dwelling-place of his perfection, joy and beauty. But this is not enough for the integral seeker; however intense and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span>, a personal isolated achievement cannot be his sole aim or his entire experience. A time must come when the personal opens out into the universal; our very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, spiritual, mental, vital, physical even, becomes universalised: it is seen as a power of his universal force and cosmic spirit, or else it contains the universe in that ineffable wideness which comes to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual consciousness</span> when it breaks its bonds and flows upward towards the Transcendent and on every side into the Infinite.\n\n---\n\nIn a Yoga lived entirely on the spiritualised mental plane it is possible and even usual for these three fundamental aspects of the Divine—the Individual or Immanent, the Cosmic and the Transcendent—to stand out as separate realisations. Each by itself then appears sufficient to satisfy the yearning of the seeker. Alone with the personal Divine in the inner heart's illumined secret chamber, he can build his being into the Beloved's image and ascend out of fallen Nature to dwell with him in some heaven of the Spirit. Absolved in the cosmic wideness, released from ego, his personality reduced to a point of working of the universal Force, himself calm, liberated, deathless in universality, motionless in the Witness Self even while outspread without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> in unending Space and Time, he can enjoy in the world the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of the Timeless. One-pointed towards some ineffable Transcendence, casting away his personality, shedding from him the labour and trouble of the universal Dynamis, he can escape into an inexpressible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>, annul all things in an intolerant exaltation of flight into the Incommunicable.\n\nBut none of these achievements is enough for one who seeks the wide completeness of an integral Yoga. An individual salvation is not enough for him; for he finds himself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> to<span class='page-number' id='s-258' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.258]</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic consciousness</span> which far exceeds by its breadth and vastness the narrower intensity of a limited individual fulfilment, and its call is imperative; driven by that immense compulsion, he must break through all separative boundaries, spread himself in world-Nature, contain the universe. Above too, there is urgent upon him a dynamic realisation pressing from the Supreme upon this world of beings, and only some encompassing and exceeding of the cosmic consciousness can release into manifestation here that yet unlavished splendour. But the cosmic consciousness too is not sufficient; for it is not all the Divine Reality, not integral. There is a divine secret behind personality that he must discover; there, waiting in it to be delivered here into Time, stands the mystery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> of the Transcendence. In the cosmic consciousness there remains at the end a hiatus, an unequal equation of a highest Knowledge that can liberate but not effectuate with a Power seeming to use a limited Knowledge or masking itself with a surface Ignorance that can create but creates imperfection or a perfection transient, limited and in fetters. On one side there is a free undynamic Witness and on the other side a bound Executrix of action who has not been given all the means of action. The reconciliation of these companions and opposites seems to be reserved, postponed, held back in an Unmanifest still beyond us. But, again, a mere escape into some absolute Transcendence leaves personality unfulfilled and the universal action inconclusive and cannot satisfy the integral seeker. He feels that the Truth that is for ever is a Power that creates as well as a stable Existence; it is not a Power solely of illusory or ignorant manifestation. The eternal Truth can manifest its truths in Time; it can create in Knowledge and not only in Inconscience and Ignorance. A divine Descent no less than an ascent to the Divine is possible; there is a prospect of the bringing down of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> perfection and a present deliverance. As his knowledge widens, it becomes for him more and more evident that it was this for which the Master of Works cast down the soul within him here as a spark of his fire into the darkness, that it might grow there into a centre of the Light that is for ever.\n\nThe Transcendent, the Universal, the Individual are three<span class='page-number' id='s-259' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.259]</span> powers overarching, underlying and penetrating the whole manifestation; this is the first of the Trinities. In the unfolding of consciousness also, these are the three fundamental terms and none of them can be neglected if we would have the experience of the whole Truth of existence. Out of the individual we wake into a vaster freer cosmic consciousness; but out of the universal too with its complex of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and powers we must emerge by a still greater self-exceeding into a consciousness without limits that is founded on the Absolute. And yet in this ascension we do not really abolish but take up and transfigure what we seem to leave; for there is a height where the three live eternally in each other, on that height they are blissfully joined in a nodus of their harmonised oneness. But that summit is above the highest and largest spiritualised mentality, even if some reflection of it can be experienced there; mind, to attain to it, to live there, must exceed itself and be transformed into a supramental gnostic light, power and substance. In this lower diminished consciousness a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> can indeed be attempted, but it must always remain imperfect; a coordination is possible, not a simultaneous fused fulfilment. An ascent out of the mind is, for any greater realisation, imperative. Or else, there must be, with the ascent or consequent to it, a dynamic descent of the self-existent Truth that exists always uplifted in its own light above Mind, eternal, prior to the manifestation of Life and Matter.\n\nFor Mind is Maya, *sat-asat*: there is a field of embrace of the true and the false, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existent</span> and the non-existent, and it is in that ambiguous field that Mind seems to reign; but even in its own reign it is in truth a diminished consciousness, it is not part of the original and supremely originating power of the Eternal. Even if Mind is able to reflect some image of essential Truth in its substance, yet the dynamic force and action of Truth appears in it always broken and divided. All Mind can do is to piece together the fragments or deduce a unity; truth of Mind is only a half-truth or a portion of a puzzle. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mental knowledge</span> is always relative, partial and inconclusive, and its outgoing action and creation come out still more confused in its steps or precise only in narrow limits and by imperfect piecings together. Even<span class='page-number' id='s-260' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.260]</span> in this diminished consciousness the Divine manifests as a Spirit in Mind, just as he moves as a Spirit in Life or dwells still more obscurely as a Spirit in Matter; but not here is his full dynamic revelation, not here the perfect identities of the Eternal. Only when we cross the border into a larger luminous consciousness and self-aware substance where divine Truth is a native and not a stranger, will there be revealed to us the Master of our existence in the imperishable integral truth of his being and his powers and his workings. Only there, too, will his works in us assume the flawless movement of his unfailing supramental purpose.\n\n---\n\nBut that is the end of a long and difficult journey, and the Master of works does not wait till then to meet the seeker on the path of Yoga and put his secret or half-shown Hand upon him and upon his life and actions. Already he was there in the world as the Originator and Receiver of works behind the dense veils of the Inconscient, disguised in force of Life, visible to the Mind through symbol godheads and figures. It may well be in these disguises that he first meets the soul destined to the way of the integral Yoga. Or even, wearing still vaguer masks, he may be conceived by us as an Ideal or mentalised as an abstract Power of Love, Good, Beauty or Knowledge; or, as we turn our feet towards the Way, he may come to us veiled as the call of Humanity or a Will in things that drives towards the deliverance of the world from the grasp of Darkness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Falsehood</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Death</span> and Suffering—the great quaternary of the Ignorance. Then, after we have entered the path, he envelops us with his wide and mighty liberating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Impersonality</span> or moves near to us with the face and form of a personal Godhead. In and around us we feel a Power that upholds and protects and cherishes; we hear a Voice that guides; a conscious Will greater than ourselves rules us; an imperative Force moves our thought and actions and our very body; an ever-widening Consciousness assimilates ours, a living Light of Knowledge lights all within, or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beatitude</span> invades us; a Mightiness presses from above, concrete, massive<span class='page-number' id='s-261' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.261]</span> and overpowering, and penetrates and pours itself into the very stuff of our nature; a Peace sits there, a Light, a Bliss, a Strength, a Greatness. Or there are relations, personal, intimate as life itself, sweet as love, encompassing like the sky, deep like deep waters. A Friend walks at our side; a Lover is with us in our heart's secrecy; a Master of the Work and the Ordeal points our way; a Creator of things uses us as his instrument; we are in the arms of the eternal Mother. All these more seizable aspects in which the Ineffable meets us are truths and not mere helpful symbols or useful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span>; but as we progress, their first imperfect formulations in our experience yield to a larger vision of the one Truth that is behind them. At each step their mere mental masks are shed and they acquire a larger, a profounder, a more intimate significance. At last on the supramental borders all these Godheads combine their forces and, without at all ceasing to be, coalesce together. On this path the Divine Aspects are not revealed in order to be cast away; they are not temporary spiritual conveniences or compromises with an illusory Consciousness or dream-figures mysteriously cast upon us by the incommunicable superconscience of the Absolute; on the contrary, their power increases and their absoluteness reveals itself as they draw near to the Truth from which they issue.\n\nFor that now superconscient Transcendence is a Power as well as an Existence. The supramental Transcendence is not a vacant Wonder, but an Inexpressible which contains for ever all essential things that have issued from it; it holds them there in their supreme everlasting reality and their own characteristic absolutes. The diminution, division, degradation that create here the sense of an unsatisfactory puzzle, a mystery of Maya, themselves diminish and fall from us in our ascension, and the Divine Powers assume their real forms and appear more and more as the terms of a Truth in process of realisation here. A soul of the Divine is here slowly awaking out of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>involution</span> and concealment in the material Inconscience. The Master of our works is not a Master of illusions, but a supreme Reality who is working out his self-expressive realities delivered slowly from the cocoons of the Ignorance in which for the purposes<span class='page-number' id='s-262' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.262]</span> of an evolutionary manifestation they were allowed for a while to slumber. For the supramental Transcendence is not a thing absolutely apart and unconnected with our present existence. It is a greater Light out of which all this has come for the adventure of the Soul lapsing into the Inconscience and emerging out of it, and, while that adventure proceeds, it waits superconscient above our minds till it can become conscious in us. Hereafter it will unveil itself and by the unveiling reveal to us all the significance of our own being and our works; for it will disclose the Divine whose fuller manifestation in the world will release and accomplish that covert significance.\n\nIn that disclosure the Transcendent Divine will be more and more made known to us as the Supreme Existence and the Perfect Source of all that we are; but equally we shall see him as a Master of works and creation prepared to pour out more and more of himself into the field of his manifestation. The cosmic consciousness and its action will appear no longer as a huge regulated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chance</span>, but as a field of the manifestation; there the Divine is seen as a presiding and pervading Cosmic Spirit who receives all out of the Transcendence and develops what descends into forms that are now an opaque disguise or a baffling half-disguise, but destined to be a transparent revelation. The individual consciousness will recover its true sense and action; for it is the form of a Soul sent out from the Supreme and, in spite of all appearances, a nucleus or nebula in which the Divine Mother-Force is at work for the victorious embodiment of the timeless and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> Divine in Time and Matter. This will reveal itself slowly to our vision and experience as the will of the Master of works and as their own ultimate significance, which alone gives to world-creation and to our own action in the world a light and a meaning. To recognise that and to strive towards its effectuation is the whole burden of the Way of Divine Works in the integral Yoga.<span class='page-number' id='s-263' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.263]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-master-of-the-work","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Divine Work","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-divine-work","prvt":"The Three Modes of Nature","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-three-modes-of-nature","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-divine-work"],"t":"The Divine Work","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> question remains for the seeker upon the way of works, when his quest is or seems to have come to its natural end,—whether any work or what work is left for the soul after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> and to what purpose?

A complete purity or transcendence of the three <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gunas</span> has been harmoniously established. The soul has seen the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of its works and lives in his presence or is consciously contained in his being or is unified with him or feels him in the heart or above and obeys his dictates. It has known its true being and cast away the veil of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>. What work then remains for the worker in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and with what motive, to what end, in what spirit will it be done?\n\n---\n\nThere is one answer with which we are very familiar in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>; no work at all remains, for the rest is quiescence. When the soul can live in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> presence of the Supreme or when it is unified with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span>, the object of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in the world, if it can be said to have an object, at once ceases.

But after all, even so, while life remains, action is unavoidable.

All existence in the world is work, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, potency, and has a dynamic effect in the whole by its mere presence, even the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> of the clod, even the silence of the immobile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span> on the verge of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. There is the question only of the manner of the action, the instruments that are used or that act of themselves, and the spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the worker. For in reality, no man works, but Nature works through him for the self-expression of a Power within that proceeds from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>. To know that and live in the presence and in the being of the Master of Nature, free from desire and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of personal impulsion, is the one thing needful. That and not the bodily cessation of action is the true release; for the bondage of works at once ceases. A man might sit still and motionless for ever and yet be as much bound to the Ignorance as the animal or the insect. But if he can make this greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> dynamic within him, then all the work of all the worlds could pass through him and yet he would remain at rest, absolute in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and peace, free from all bondage. Action in the world is given us first as a means for our self-development and self-fulfilment; but even if we reached a last possible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> self-completeness, it would still remain as a means for the fulfilment of the divine intention in the world and of the larger universal self of which each being is a portion—a portion that has come down with it from the Transcendence.\n\nIn a certain sense, when his Yoga has reached a certain culmination, works cease for a man; for he has no further personal necessity of works, no sense of works being done by him; but there is no need to flee from action or to take refuge in a blissful inertia. For now he acts as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Existence</span> acts without any binding necessity and without any compelling ignorance. Even in doing works *he* does not work at all; he undertakes<span class='page-number' id='s-265' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.265]</span> no personal initiative. It is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> that works in him through his nature; his action develops through the spontaneity of a supreme Force by which his instruments are possessed, of which he is a part, with whose will his will is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> and his power is her power. The spirit within him contains, supports and watches this action; it presides over it in knowledge but is not glued or clamped to the work by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> or need, is not bound by desire of its fruit, is not enslaved to any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> or impulse.\n\nIt is a common error to suppose that action is impossible or at least meaningless without desire. If desire ceases, we are told, action also must cease. But this, like other too simply comprehensive generalisations, is more attractive to the cutting and defining <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> than true. The major part of the work done in the universe is accomplished without any interference of desire; it proceeds by the calm necessity and spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of Nature</span>. Even man constantly does work of various kinds by a spontaneous impulse, intuition, instinct or acts in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to a natural necessity and law of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> without either mental planning or the urge of a conscious vital volition or emotional desire. Often enough his act is contrary to his intention or his desire; it proceeds out of him in subjection to a need or compulsion, in submission to an impulse, in obedience to a force in him that pushes for self-expression or in conscious pursuance of a higher principle. Desire is an additional lure to which Nature has given a great part in the life of animated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to produce a certain kind of rajasic action necessary for her intermediate ends; but it is not her sole or even her chief engine. It has its great use while it endures: it helps us to rise out of inertia, it contradicts many tamasic forces which would otherwise inhibit action. But the seeker who has advanced far on the way of works has passed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> this intermediate stage in which desire is a helpful engine. Its push is no longer indispensable for his action, but is rather a terrible hindrance and source of stumbling, inefficiency and failure. Others are obliged to obey a personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> or motive, but he has to learn to act with an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> or a universal mind or as a part or an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of an infinite Person. A<span class='page-number' id='s-266' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.266]</span> calm indifference, a joyful impartiality or a blissful response to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Force</span>, whatever its dictate, is the condition of his doing any effective work or undertaking any worth-while action. Not desire, not attachment must drive him, but a Will that stirs in a divine peace, a Knowledge that moves from the transcendent Light, a glad Impulse that is a force from the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.\n\n---\n\nIn an advanced stage of the Yoga it is indifferent to the seeker, in the sense of any personal preference, what action he shall do or not do; even whether he shall act or not, is not decided by his personal choice or pleasure. Always he is moved to do whatever is in consonance with the Truth or whatever the Divine demands through his nature. A false conclusion is sometimes drawn from this that the spiritual man, accepting the position in which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> or his past Karma has placed him, content to work in the field and cadre of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, occupation which are his by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> and circumstance, will not and even perhaps ought not to make any movement to exceed them or to pursue any great mundane end. Since he has really no work to do, since he has only to use works, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> what works, as long as he is in the body in order to arrive at liberation or, having arrived, only to obey the supreme Will and do whatever it dictates, the actual field given him is sufficient for the purpose. Once free, he has only to continue working in the sphere assigned to him by Fate and circumstances till the great hour arrives when he can at last disappear into the Infinite. To insist on any particular end or to work for some great mundane object is to fall into the illusion of works; it is to entertain the error that terrestrial life has an intelligible intention and contains <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> worthy of pursuit. The great theory of Illusion, which is a practical denial of the Divine in the world, even when in idea it acknowledges the Presence, is once more before us. But the Divine is here in the world,—not only in status but in dynamis, not only as a spiritual self and presence but as power, force, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>,—and therefore a divine work in the world is possible.<span class='page-number' id='s-267' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.267]</span>\n\nThere is no narrow principle, no field of cabined action that can be imposed on the Karmayogin as his rule or his province. This much is true that every kind of works, whether small to man's imagination or great, petty in scope or wide, can be equally used in the progress towards liberation or for self-discipline. This much is also true that after liberation a man may dwell in any sphere of life and in any kind of action and fulfil there his existence in the Divine. According as he is moved by the Spirit, he may remain in the sphere assigned to him by birth and circumstances or break that framework and go forth to an untrammelled action which shall be the fitting body of his greatened consciousness and higher knowledge. To the outward eyes of men the inner liberation may make no apparent difference in his outward acts; or, on the contrary, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> within may translate itself into an outward dynamic working so large and new that all regards are drawn by this novel force. If such be the intention of the Supreme within him, the liberated soul may be content with a subtle and limited action within the old human surroundings which will in no way seek to change their outward appearance. But it may too be called to a work which will not only alter the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and sphere of its own external life but, leaving nothing around it unchanged or unaffected, create a new world or a new order.\n\n---\n\nA prevalent idea would persuade us that the sole aim of liberation is to secure for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> soul freedom from physical rebirth in the unstable life of the universe. If this freedom is once assured, there is no further work for it in life here or elsewhere or only that which the continued existence of the body demands or the unfulfilled effects of past lives necessitate. This little, rapidly exhausted or consumed by the fire of Yoga, will cease with the departure of the released soul from the body. The aim of escape from rebirth, now long fixed in the Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> as the highest object of the soul, has replaced the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of a heaven beyond fixed in the mentality of the devout by many religions<span class='page-number' id='s-268' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.268]</span> as their divine lure. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian religion</span> also upheld that earlier and lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> when the gross external interpretation of the Vedic hymns was the dominant creed, and the dualists in later India also have kept that as part of their supreme spiritual motive. Undoubtedly a release from the limitations of the mind and body into an eternal peace, rest, silence of the Spirit, makes a higher appeal than the offer of a heaven of mental joys or eternised physical pleasures, but this too after all is a lure; its insistence on the mind's world-weariness, the life-being's shrinking from the adventure of birth, strikes a chord of weakness and cannot be the supreme motive. The desire of personal salvation, however high its form, is an outcome of ego; it rests on the idea of our own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> and its desire for its personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> or welfare, its longing for a release from suffering or its cry for the extinction of the trouble of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> and makes that the supreme aim of our existence. To rise beyond the desire of personal salvation is necessary for the complete rejection of this basis of ego. If we seek the Divine, it should be for the sake of the Divine and for nothing else, because that is the supreme call of our being, the deepest truth of the spirit. The pursuit of liberation, of the soul's freedom, of the realisation of our true and highest self, of union with the Divine, is justified only because it is the highest law of our nature, because it is the attraction of that which is lower in us to that which is highest, because it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Will</span> in us. That is its sufficient justification and its one truest reason; all other motives are excrescences, minor or incidental truths or useful lures which the soul must abandon, the moment their utility has passed and the state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with the Supreme and with all beings has become our normal consciousness and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of that state our spiritual atmosphere.\n\nOften, we see this desire of personal salvation overcome by another attraction which also belongs to the higher turn of our nature and which indicates the essential <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the action the liberated soul must pursue. It is that which is implied in the great legend of the Amitabha Buddha who turned away when his spirit was on the threshold of Nirvana and took the vow never to cross it while a single being remained in the sorrow<span class='page-number' id='s-269' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.269]</span> and the Ignorance. It is that which underlies the sublime verse of the Bhagavata Purana, \"I desire not the supreme state with all its eight siddhis nor the cessation of rebirth; may I assume the sorrow of all creatures who suffer and enter into them so that they may be made free from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>.\" It is that which inspires a remarkable passage in a letter of Swami Vivekananda. \"I have lost all wish for my salvation,\" wrote the great Vedantin, \"may I be born again and again and suffer thousands of miseries so that I may worship the only God that exists, the only God I believe in, the sum-total of all souls,—and above all, my God the wicked, my God the miserable, my God the poor of all races, of all species is the special object of my worship. He who is the high and low, the saint and the sinner, the god and the worm, Him worship, the visible, the knowable, the real, the omnipresent; break all other idols. In whom there is neither past life nor <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> birth, nor <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> nor going nor coming, in whom we always have been and always will be one, Him worship; break all other idols.\"\n\nThe last two sentences contain indeed the whole gist of the matter. The true salvation or the true freedom from the chain of rebirth is not the rejection of terrestrial life or the individual's escape by a spiritual self-annihilation, even as the true renunciation is not the mere physical abandonment of family and society; it is the inner identification with the Divine in whom there is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> of past life and future birth but instead the eternal existence of the unborn Soul. He who is free inwardly, even doing actions, does nothing at all, says the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>; for it is Nature that works in him under the control of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of Nature. Equally, even if he assumes a hundred times the body, he is free from any chain of birth or mechanical wheel of existence since he lives in the unborn and undying spirit and not in the life of the body. Therefore attachment to the escape from rebirth is one of the idols which, whoever keeps, the sadhaka of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> must break and cast away from him. For his Yoga is not limited to the realisation of the Transcendent beyond all world by the individual soul; it embraces also the realisation of the Universal, \"the sum-total of all souls\", and cannot therefore be confined to the movement of a personal salvation and escape.<span class='page-number' id='s-270' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.270]</span> Even in his transcendence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> limitations he is still one with all in God; a divine work remains for him in the universe.\n\n---\n\nThat work cannot be fixed by any mind-made rule or human standard; for his consciousness has moved away from human law and limits and passed into the divine liberty, away from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> by the external and transient into the self-rule of the inner and eternal, away from the binding forms of the finite into the free self-determination of the Infinite. \"Howsoever he lives and acts,\" says the Gita, \"he lives and acts in Me.\" The rules which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> of men lays down cannot apply to the liberated soul,—by the external criteria and tests which their mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> and prejudgments prescribe, such a one cannot be judged; he is outside the narrow jurisdiction of these fallible tribunals. It is immaterial whether he wears the garb of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> or lives the full life of the householder; whether he spends his days in what men call holy works or in the many-sided activities of the world; whether he devotes himself to the direct leading of men to the Light like Buddha, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span> or Shankara or governs kingdoms like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Janaka</span> or stands before men like Sri <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span> as a politician or a leader of armies; what he eats or drinks; what are his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> or his pursuits; whether he fails or succeeds; whether his work be one of construction or of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span>; whether he supports or restores an old order or labours to replace it by a new; whether his associates are those whom men <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> to honour or those whom their sense of superior righteousness out-castes and reprobates; whether his life and deeds are approved by his contemporaries or he is condemned as a misleader of men and a fomenter of religious, moral or social heresies. He is not governed by the judgments of men or the laws laid down by the ignorant; he obeys an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner voice</span> and is moved by an unseen Power. His real life is within and this is its description that he lives, moves and acts in God, in the Divine, in the Infinite.\n\nBut if his action is governed by no external rule, one rule it will observe that is not external; it will be dictated by no personal<span class='page-number' id='s-271' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.271]</span> desire or aim, but will be a part of a conscious and eventually a well-ordered because self-ordered divine working in the world. The Gita declares that the action of the liberated man must be directed not by desire, but towards the keeping together of the world, its government, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>, impulsion, maintenance in the path appointed to it. This injunction has been interpreted in the sense that the world being an illusion in which most men must be kept, since they are unfit for liberation, he must so act outwardly as to cherish in them an attachment to their customary works laid down for them by the social law. If so, it would be a poor and petty rule and every noble heart would reject it to follow rather the divine vow of Amitabha Buddha, the sublime prayer of the Bhagavata, the passionate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of Vivekananda. But if we accept rather the view that the world is a divinely guided movement of Nature emerging in man towards God and that this is the work in which the Lord of the Gita declares that he is ever occupied although he himself has nothing ungained that he has yet to win, then a deep and true sense will appear for this great injunction. To participate in that divine work, to live for God in the world will be the rule of the Karmayogin; to live for God in the world and therefore so to act that the Divine may more and more manifest himself and the world go forward by whatever way of its obscure pilgrimage and move nearer to the divine ideal.\n\nHow he shall do this, in what particular way, can be decided by no general rule. It must develop or define itself from within; the decision lies between God and our self, the Supreme Self and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span> that is the instrument of the work; even before liberation, it is from the inner self, as soon as we become conscious of it, that there rises the sanction, the spiritually determined choice. It is altogether from within that must come the knowledge of the work that has to be done. There is no particular work, no law or form or outwardly fixed or invariable way of works which can be said to be that of the liberated being. The phrase used in the Gita to express this work that has to be done has indeed been interpreted in the sense that we must do our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> without regard to the fruit. But this is a conception born of European culture which is ethical rather than spiritual and<span class='page-number' id='s-272' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.272]</span> external rather than inwardly profound in its concepts. No such general thing as duty exists; we have only duties, often in conflict with each other, and these are determined by our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, our social relations, our external status in life. They are of great value in training the immature <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral nature</span> and setting up a standard which discourages the action of selfish desire. It has already been said that so long as the seeker has no inner light, he must govern himself by the best light he has, and duty, a principle, a cause are among the standards he may temporarily erect and observe. But for all that, duties are external things, not stuff of the soul and cannot be the ultimate standard of action in this path. It is the duty of the soldier to fight when called upon, even to fire upon his own kith and kin; but such a standard or any akin to it cannot be imposed on the liberated man. On the other hand, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> or have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span>, to obey the highest truth of our being, to follow the command of the Divine are not duties; these things are a law of the nature as it rises towards the Divine, an outflowing of action from a soul-state, a high reality of the spirit. The action of the liberated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> of works must be even such an outflowing from the soul; it must come to him or out of him as a natural result of his spiritual union with the Divine and not be formed by an edifying construction of the mental thought and will, the practical reason or the social sense. In the ordinary life a personal, social or traditional constructed rule, standard or ideal is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span>; once the spiritual journey has begun, this must be replaced by an inner and outer rule or way of living necessary for our self-discipline, liberation and perfection, a way of living proper to the path we follow or enjoined by the spiritual guide and master, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Guru</span>, or else dictated by a Guide within us. But in the last state of the soul's infinity and freedom all outward standards are replaced or laid aside and there is left only a spontaneous and integral obedience to the Divine with whom we are in union and an action spontaneously fulfilling the integral spiritual truth of our being and nature.<span class='page-number' id='s-273' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.273]</span>\n\n---\n\nIt is this deeper sense in which we must accept the dictum of the Gita that action determined and governed by the nature must be our law of works. It is not, certainly, the superficial temperament or the character or habitual impulses that are meant, but in the literal sense of the Sanskrit word our \"own being\", our essential nature, the divine stuff of our souls. Whatever springs from this root or flows from these sources is profound, essential, right; the rest—<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>, impulses, habits, desires—may be merely surface <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> or casual vagaries of the being or impositions from outside. They shift and change, but this remains constant. It is not the executive forms taken by Nature in us that are ourselves or the abidingly constant and expressive shape of ourselves; it is the spiritual being in us—and this includes the soul-becoming of it—that persists through time in the universe.\n\nWe cannot, however, easily distinguish this true inner law of our being; it is kept screened from us so long as the heart and intellect remain unpurified from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span>: till then we follow superficial and impermanent ideas, impulses, desires, suggestions and impositions of all kinds from our environment or work out formations of our temporary mental, vital, physical personality—that passing experimental and structural self which has been made for us by an interaction between our being and the pressure of a lower cosmic Nature. In proportion as we are purified, the true being within declares itself more clearly; our will is less entangled in suggestions from outside or shut up in our own superficial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental constructions</span>. Egoism renounced, the nature purified, action will come from the soul's dictates, from the depths or the heights of the spirit, or it will be openly governed by the Lord who was all the time seated secretly within our hearts. The supreme and final word of the Gita for the Yogin is that he should leave all conventional formulas of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> and action, all fixed and external rules of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>, all constructions of the outward or surface Nature, *dharmas*, and take refuge in the Divine alone. Free from desire and attachment, one with all beings, living in the infinite Truth and Purity and acting out of the profoundest deeps of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner consciousness</span>, governed by his immortal, divine and highest Self, all his works will be<span class='page-number' id='s-274' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.274]</span> directed by the Power within through that essential spirit and nature in us which, knowing, warring, working, loving, serving, is always divine, towards the fulfilment of God in the world, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the Eternal in Time.\n\nA <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span> arising spontaneously, freely, infallibly from the light and force of our spiritual self in union with the Divine is the last state of this integral Yoga of Works. The truest reason why we must seek liberation is not to be delivered, individually, from the sorrow of the world, though that deliverance too will be given to us, but that we may be one with the Divine, the Supreme, the Eternal. The truest reason why we must seek perfection, a supreme status, purity, knowledge, strength, love, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, is not that personally we may enjoy the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span> or be even as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>, though that enjoyment too will be ours, but because this liberation and perfection are the divine Will in us, the highest truth of our self in Nature, the always intended <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of a progressive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> in the universe. The divine Nature, free and perfect and blissful, must be manifested in the individual in order that it may manifest in the world. Even in the Ignorance the individual lives really in the universal and for the universal Purpose, for in the very act of pursuing the purposes and desires of his ego, he is forced by Nature to contribute by his egoistic action to her work and purpose in the worlds; but it is without conscious intention, imperfectly done, and his contribution is to her half-evolved and half-conscient, her imperfect and crude movement. To escape from ego and be united with the Divine is at once the liberation and the consummation of his individuality; so liberated, purified, perfected, the individual—the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine soul</span>—lives consciously and entirely, as was from the first intended, in and for the cosmic and transcendent Divine and for his Will in the universe.\n\nIn the Way of Knowledge we may arrive at a point where we can leap out of personality and universe, escape from all thought and will and works and all way of Nature and, absorbed and taken up into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternity</span>, plunge into the Transcendence; that, though not obligatory on the God-knower, may be the soul's decision, the turn pursued by the self within us. In the Way of<span class='page-number' id='s-275' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.275]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span> we may reach through an intensity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> union with the supreme All-Beloved and remain eternally in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of his presence, absorbed in him alone, intimately in one world of bliss with him; that then may be our being's impulsion, its spiritual choice. But in the Way of Works another prospect opens; for travelling on that path, we can enter into liberation and perfection by becoming of one law and power of nature with the Eternal; we are identified with him in our will and dynamic self as much as in our spiritual status; a divine way of works is the natural outcome of this union, a divine living in a spiritual freedom the body of its self-expression. In the Integral Yoga these three lines of approach give up their exclusions, meet and coalesce or spring out of each other; liberated from the mind's veil over the self, we live in the Transcendence, enter by the adoration of the heart into the oneness of a supreme love and bliss, and all our forces of being uplifted into the one Force, our will and works surrendered into the one Will and Power, assume the dynamic perfection of the divine Nature.<span class='page-number' id='s-276' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.276]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-divine-work","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"Appendix to Part I","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/appendix-to-part-i","prvt":"The Master of the Work","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-master-of-the-work","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["appendix-to-part-i"],"t":"Appendix to Part I","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The following chapter was left unfinished.

Some therefore must choose as a starting-point a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> in thought or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span> or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>'s one-pointedness to find the eternal reality of the Self in them; others can more easily withdraw into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> to meet there the Divine, the Eternal: yet others are predominantly dynamic and active; for these it is best to centre themselves in the will and enlarge their being through works. United with the Self and source of all by their surrender of their will into its infinity, guided in their works by the secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> within or surrendered to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> action as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> and mover of all their energies of thought, feeling, act, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> by this enlargement of being selfless and universal, they can reach by works some first fullness of a spiritual status. But the path, whatever its point of starting, must debouch into a vaster dominion; it must proceed in the end through a totality of integrated knowledge, emotion, will of dynamic action, perfection of the being and the entire nature. In the supramental consciousness, on the level of the supramental existence this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integration</span> becomes consummate;<span class='page-number' id='s-279' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.279]</span> there knowledge, will, emotion, the perfection of the self and the dynamic nature rise each to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> of itself and all to their perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and fusion with each other, to a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span>, a divine perfection. For the supermind is a Truth-Consciousness in which the Divine Reality, fully manifested, no longer works with the instrumentation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>; a truth of status of being which is absolute becomes dynamic in a truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of the being which is self-existent and perfect. Every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> there is a movement of the self-aware truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Being</span> and every part is in entire harmony with the whole. Even the most limited and finite action is in the Truth-Consciousness a movement of the Eternal and Infinite and partakes of the inherent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absoluteness</span> and perfection of the Eternal and Infinite. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into the supramental Truth not only raises our spiritual and essential consciousness to that height but brings about a descent of this Light and Truth into all our being and all our parts of nature. All then becomes part of the Divine Truth, an element and means of the supreme union and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>; this ascent and descent must be therefore an ultimate aim of this Yoga.\n\nA union with the Divine Reality of our being and all being is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> essential object of the Yoga. It is necessary to keep this in mind; we must remember that our Yoga is not undertaken for the sake of the acquisition of supermind itself but for the sake of the Divine; we seek the supermind not for its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and greatness but to make the union absolute and complete, to feel it, possess it, dynamise it in every possible way of our being, in its highest intensities and largest widenesses and in every range and turn and nook and recess of our nature. It is a mistake to think, as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> are apt to think, that the object of a supramental Yoga is to arrive at a mighty magnificence of supermanhood, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine power</span> and greatness, the self-fulfilment of a magnified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> personality. This is a false and disastrous conception,—disastrous because it is likely to raise the pride, vanity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span> of the rajasic vital mind in us and that, if not overpassed and overcome, must lead to spiritual downfall, false because it is an egoistic conception and the first condition of the supramental change is to get rid of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>. It is most dangerous for the active and<span class='page-number' id='s-280' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.280]</span> dynamic nature of the man of will and works which can easily be led away by the pursuit of power. Power comes inevitably by the supramental change, it is a necessary condition for a perfect action: but it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Shakti</span> that comes and takes up the nature and the life, the power of the One acting through the spiritual individual; it is not an aggrandisement of the personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, not the last crowning fulfilment of the separative mental and vital ego. Self-fulfilment is a result of the Yoga, but its aim is not the greatness of the individual. The sole aim is a spiritual perfection, a finding of the true self and a union with the Divine by putting on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> and nature.[^1] All the rest is constituent detail and attendant circumstance. Ego-centric impulses, ambition, desire of power and greatness, motives of self-assertion are foreign to this greater consciousness and would be an insuperable bar against any possibility of even a distant approach towards the supramental change. One must lose one's little lower self to find the greater self. Union with the Divine must be the master motive; even the discovery of the truth of one's own being and of all being, life in that truth and its greater consciousness, perfection of the nature are only the natural results of that movement. Indispensable conditions of its entire consummation, they are part of the central aim only because they are a necessary development and a major consequence.\n\n[^1]: *sādharmya <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mukti</span>.*\n\nIt must also be kept in mind that the supramental change is difficult, distant, an ultimate stage; it must be regarded as the end of a far-off vista; it cannot be and must not be turned into a first aim, a constantly envisaged <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> or an immediate objective. For it can only come into the view of possibility after much arduous self-conquest and self-exceeding, at the end of many long and trying stages of a difficult self-evolution of the nature. One must first acquire an inner Yogic consciousness and replace by it our ordinary view of things, natural movements, motives of life; one must revolutionise the whole present build of our being. Next, we have to go still deeper, discover our veiled psychic entity and<span class='page-number' id='s-281' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.281]</span> in its light and under its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> psychicise our inner and outer parts, turn mind-nature, life-nature, body-nature and all our mental, vital, physical action and states and movements into a conscious instrumentation of the soul. Afterwards or concurrently we have to spiritualise the being in its entirety by a descent of a divine Light, Force, Purity, Knowledge, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and wideness. It is necessary to break down the limits of the personal mind, life and physicality, dissolve the ego, enter into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic consciousness</span>, realise the self, acquire a spiritualised and universalised mind and heart, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span>, physical consciousness. Then only the passage into supramental consciousness begins to become possible, and even then there is a difficult ascent to make each stage of which is a separate arduous achievement. Yoga is a rapid and concentrated conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of the being, but however rapid, even though it may effect in a single life what in an unassisted Nature might take centuries and millenniums or many hundreds of lives, still all evolution must move by stages; even the greatest rapidity and concentration of the movement cannot swallow up all the stages or reverse natural process and bring the end near to the beginning. A hasty and ignorant mind, a too eager force easily forget this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>; they rush forward to make the supermind an immediate aim and expect to pull it down with a pitchfork from its highest heights in the Infinite. This is not only an absurd expectation but full of danger. For the vital desire may very well bring in an action of dark or vehement vital powers which hold out before it a promise of immediate fulfilment of its impossible longing; the consequence is likely to be a plunge into many kinds of self-deception, a yielding to the falsehoods and temptations of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of darkness, a hunt for supernormal powers, a turning away from the Divine to the Asuric nature, a fatal self-inflation into an unnatural unhuman and undivine bigness of magnified ego. If the being is small, the nature weak and incapable, there is not this large-scale disaster; but a loss of balance, a mental unhinging and fall into unreason or a vital unhinging and consequent moral aberration or a deviation into some kind of morbid abnormality of the nature may be the untoward consequence. This is not a Yoga in which<span class='page-number' id='s-282' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.282]</span> abnormality of any kind, even if it be an exalted abnormality, can be admitted as a way to self-fulfilment or spiritual realisation. Even when one enters into supernormal and suprarational experience, there should be no disturbance of the poise which must be kept firm from the summit of the consciousness to its base; the experiencing consciousness must preserve a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> balance, an unfailing clarity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span>, a sort of sublimated commonsense, an unfailing power of self-criticism, right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span>, coordination and firm vision of things; a sane grasp on facts and a high spiritualised positivism must always be there. It is not by becoming irrational or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infrarational</span> that one can go <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> ordinary nature into supernature; it should be done by passing through reason to a greater light of superreason. This superreason descends into reason and takes it up into higher levels even while breaking its limitations; reason is not lost but changes and becomes its own true unlimited self, a coordinating power of the supernature.\n\nAnother error that has to be guarded against is also one to which our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> is easily prone; it is to take some higher intermediate consciousness or even any kind of supernormal consciousness for the supermind. To reach supermind it is not enough to go above the ordinary movements of the human mind; it is not enough to receive a greater light, a greater power, a greater joy or to develop capacities of knowledge, sight, effective will that surpass the normal range of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>. All light is not the light of the spirit, still less is all light the light of the supermind; the mind, the vital, the physical itself have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> of their own, as yet hidden, which can be very inspiring, exalting, informative, powerfully executive. A breaking out into the cosmic consciousness may also bring in an immense enlargement of the consciousness and power. An <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner mind</span>, inner vital, inner physical, any range of the subliminal consciousness, can liberate an activity of abnormal or supernormal powers of knowledge, action or experience which the uninstructed mind can easily mistake for spiritual revelations, inspirations, intuitions. An opening upward into the greater ranges of the higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> can bring down much light and force creating<span class='page-number' id='s-283' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.283]</span> an intense activity of the intuitivised mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> or an ascent into these ranges can bring a true but still incomplete light easily exposed to mixture, a light which is spiritual in its source though it does not always remain spiritual in its active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> when it comes down into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span>. But none of these things is the supramental light, the supramental power; that can only be seen and grasped when we have reached the summits of mental being, entered into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>overmind</span> and stand on the borders of an upper, a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hemisphere</span> of spiritual existence. There the ignorance, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span>, the original blank <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nescience</span> slowly awaking towards a half-knowledge, which are the basis of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> Nature</span> and which surround, penetrate and powerfully <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> all our powers of mind and life, cease altogether; for an unmixed and unmodified Truth-consciousness is there the substance of all the being, its pure spiritual texture. To imagine that we have reached such a condition when we are still moving in the dynamics of the Ignorance, though it may be an enlightened or illumined Ignorance, is to lay ourselves open either to a disastrous misleading or to an arrest of the evolution of the being. For if it is some inferior state that we thus mistake for the supermind, it lays us open to all the dangers we have seen to attend a presumptuous egoistic haste in our demand for achievement. If it is one of the higher states that we presume to be the highest, we may, though we achieve much, yet fall short of the greater, more perfect goal of our being; for we shall remain content with an approximation and the supreme transformation will escape us. Even the achievement of a complete inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> and a high spiritual consciousness is not that supreme transformation; for we may have that achievement, a status perfect in itself, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>, and still our dynamic parts may in their instrumentation belong to an enlightened spiritualised mind and may be in consequence, like all mind, defective even in its greater power and knowledge, still subject to a partial or local obscuration or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> by the original circumscribing nescience.<span class='page-number' id='s-284' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.284]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-supermind-and-the-yoga-of-works","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Divine Works"}],"nxtt":"The Object of Knowledge","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-object-of-knowledge","prvt":"Appendix to Part I","prvu":"/cwsa/23/appendix-to-part-i","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-object-of-knowledge"],"t":"The Object of Knowledge","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> spiritual seeking moves towards an object of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span> to which men ordinarily do not turn the eye of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, to someone or something <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span> that is not the temporal things or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of which we are sensible, although he or it may be in them or behind them or their source or creator.

All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> existence or all that we call existence is a state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span>. Even the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> perfection, even the most blissful cosmic condition is no better than a supreme ignorance. All that is individual, all that is cosmic has to be austerely renounced by the seeker of the absolute Truth. The supreme quiescent Self or else the absolute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nihil</span> is the sole Truth, the only object of spiritual knowledge.

The means are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span>, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> excluding all things else, a total loss of the mind in its object. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Action</span> is permissible only in the first stages of the search in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to purify the seeker and make him morally and temperamentally a fit vessel for the knowledge. Even this action must either be confined to the performance of the rites of worship and the prescribed duties of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> rigorously ordained by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hindu Shastra</span> or, as in the Buddhistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span>, must be guided along the eightfold path to the supreme practice of the works of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> which lead towards the practical annihilation of self in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of others. In the end, in any severe and pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jnanayoga</span>, all works must be abandoned for an entire quiescence. Action may prepare salvation; it cannot give it. Any continued adherence to action is incompatible with the highest progress and may be an insuperable obstacle to the attainment of the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>. The supreme state of quiescence is the very opposite of action and cannot be attained by those who persist in works. And even <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, worship are disciplines for the unripe soul, are at best the best methods of the Ignorance. For they are offered to something other, higher and greater than ourselves; but in the supreme knowledge there can be no such thing, since there is either only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> self or no self at all and therefore either no one to do the worship and offer the love and devotion or no one to receive it. Even thought-activity must disappear in the sole consciousness of identity or of nothingness and by its own quiescence bring about the quiescence of the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. The absolute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Identical</span> alone must remain or else the eternal Nihil.\n\nThis pure Jnanayoga comes by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, although it ends in the transcendence of the intellect and its workings. The thinker in us separates himself from all the rest of what we phenomenally are, rejects the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, draws back from the life and the senses, separates from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> that he may arrive at his own exclusive fulfilment in that which is beyond even himself and his function. There is a truth that underlies, as there is<span class='page-number' id='s-288' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.288]</span> an experience that seems to justify this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span>. There is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Essence</span> that is in its nature a quiescence, a supreme of Silence in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Being</span> that is beyond its own developments and mutations, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> and therefore superior to all activities of which it is at most a Witness. And in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hierarchy</span> of our psychological functions the Thought is in a way nearest to this Self, nearest at least to its aspect of the all-conscious knower who regards all activities but can stand back from them all. The heart, will and other powers in us are fundamentally active, turn naturally towards action, find through it their fulfilment,—although they also may automatically arrive at a certain quiescence by fullness of satisfaction in their activities or else by a reverse process of exhaustion through perpetual disappointment and dissatisfaction. The thought too is an active power, but is more capable of arriving at quiescence by its own conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> and will. The thought is more easily content with the illumined intellectual perception of this silent Witness Self that is higher than all our activities and, that immobile Spirit once seen, is ready, deeming its mission of truth-finding accomplished, to fall at rest and become itself immobile. For in its most characteristic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> it is itself apt to be a disinterested witness, judge, observer of things more than an eager participant and passionate labourer in the work and can arrive very readily at a spiritual or philosophic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and detached aloofness. And since men are mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, thought, if not truly their best and highest, is at least their most constant, normal and effective means for enlightening their ignorance. Armed with its functions of gathering and reflection, meditation, fixed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span>, the absorbed dwelling of the mind on its object, *śravaṇa, manana, nididhyāsana*, it stands at our tops as an indispensable aid to our realisation of that which we pursue, and it is not surprising that it should claim to be the leader of the journey and the only available <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> or at least the direct and innermost door of the temple.\n\nIn reality, thought is only a scout and pioneer; it can guide but not command or effectuate. The leader of the journey, the captain of the march, the first and most ancient priest of our sacrifice is the Will. This Will is not the wish of the heart or<span class='page-number' id='s-289' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.289]</span> the demand or preference of the mind to which we often give the name. It is that inmost, dominant and often veiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span></span> of our being and of all being, Tapas, Shakti, Sraddha, that sovereignly determines our orientation and of which the intellect and the heart are more or less blind and automatic servants and instruments. The Self that is quiescent, at rest, vacant of things and happenings is a support and background to existence, a silent channel or a hypostasis of something Supreme: it is not itself the one entirely real existence, not itself the Supreme. The Eternal, the Supreme is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> and the all-originating Spirit. Superior to all activities and not bound by any of them, it is the source, sanction, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>, efficient power, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of all activities. All activities proceed from this supreme Self and are determined by it; all are its operations, processes of its own conscious force and not of something alien to Self, some power other than the Spirit. In these activities is expressed the conscious Will or Shakti of the Spirit moved to manifest its being in infinite ways, a Will or Power not ignorant but at one with its own self-knowledge and its knowledge of all that it is put out to express. And of this Power a secret spiritual will and soul-faith in us, the dominant hidden force of our nature, is the individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, more nearly in communication with the Supreme, a surer guide and enlightener, could we once get at it and hold it, because profounder and more intimately near to the Identical and Absolute than the surface activities of our thought powers. To know that will in ourselves and in the universe and follow it to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> finalities, whatever these may be, must surely be the highest way and truest culmination for knowledge as for works, for the seeker in life and for the seeker in Yoga.\n\n![Image 1](https://incarnateword-in-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cwsa/23-the-object-of-knowledge.jpg)\n\nThe thought, since it is not the highest or strongest part of Nature, not even the sole or deepest index to Truth, ought not to follow its own exclusive satisfaction or take that for the sign of its attainment to the supreme Knowledge. It is here as the guide, up to a certain point, of the heart, the life and the other members, but it cannot be a substitute for them; it has to see not only what is its own ultimate satisfaction but whether there is not an ultimate satisfaction intended also for these other<span class='page-number' id='s-290' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.290]</span> members. An exclusive path of abstract thought would be justified, only if the object of the Supreme Will in the universe has been nothing more than a descent into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of the ignorance operated by the mind as blinding instrument and jailor through false idea and sensation and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into the quiescence of knowledge equally operated by the mind through correct thought as enlightening instrument and saviour. But the chances are that there is an aim in the world less absurd and aimless, an impulse towards the Absolute less dry and abstract, a truth of the world more large and complex, a more richly infinite height of the Infinite. Certainly, an abstract <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> must always arrive, as the old systems arrived, at an infinite empty Negation or an infinite equally vacant Affirmation; for, abstract it moves towards an absolute abstraction and these are the only two abstractions that are absolutely absolute. But a concrete ever deepening wisdom waiting on more and more riches of infinite experience and not the confident abstract logic of the narrow and incompetent human mind is likely to be the key to a divine suprahuman knowledge. The heart, the will, the life and even the body, no less than the thought, are forms of a divine Conscious-Being and indices of great significance. These too have powers by which the soul can return to its complete self-awareness or means by which it can enjoy it. The object of the Supreme Will may well be a culmination in which the whole being is intended to receive its divine satisfaction, the heights enlightening the depths, the material Inconscient revealed to itself as the Divine by the touch of the supreme Superconscience.\n\nThe traditional Way of Knowledge proceeds by elimination and rejects successively the body, the life, the senses, the heart, the very thought in order to merge into the quiescent Self or supreme Nihil or indefinite Absolute. The way of integral knowledge supposes that we are intended to arrive at an integral self-fulfilment and the only thing that is to be eliminated is our own unconsciousness, the Ignorance and the results of the Ignorance. Eliminate the falsity of the being which figures as the ego; then our true being can manifest in us. Eliminate the falsity of the life which figures as mere vital craving and the mechanical<span class='page-number' id='s-291' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.291]</span> round of our corporeal existence; our true life in the power of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of the Infinite will appear. Eliminate the falsity of the senses with their subjection to material shows and to dual sensations; there is a greater sense in us that can open through these to the Divine in things and divinely reply to it.

Not something quite other than themselves from which they are all cast away is the end of these things in our nature, but something supreme in which they at once transcend themselves and find their own absolutes and infinitudes, their harmonies beyond measure.\n\nBehind the traditional way of Knowledge, justifying its thought-process of elimination and withdrawal, stands an overmastering spiritual experience. Deep, intense, convincing, common to all who have overstepped a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> of the active mind-belt into horizonless inner space, this is the great experience of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, the consciousness of something within us that is behind and outside of the universe and all its forms, interests, aims, events and happenings, calm, untouched, unconcerned, illimitable, immobile, free, the uplook to something above us indescribable and unseizable into which by abolition of our personality we can enter, the presence of an omnipresent eternal<span class='page-number' id='s-292' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.292]</span> witness Purusha, the sense of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinity</span> or a Timelessness that looks down on us from an august negation of all our existence and is alone the one thing Real. This experience is the highest sublimation of spiritualised mind looking resolutely beyond its own existence. No one who has not passed through this liberation can be entirely free from the mind and its meshes, but one is not compelled to linger in this experience for ever. Great as it is, it is only the Mind's overwhelming experience of what is beyond itself and all it can conceive. It is a supreme negative experience, but beyond it is all the tremendous light of an infinite Consciousness, an illimitable Knowledge, an affirmative absolute Presence.\n\nThe object of spiritual knowledge is the Supreme, the Divine, the Infinite and Absolute. This Supreme has its relations to our individual being and its relations to the universe and it transcends both the soul and the universe. Neither the universe nor the individual are what they seem to be, for the report of them which our mind and our senses give us is, so long as they are unenlightened by a faculty of higher supramental and suprasensuous knowledge, a false report, an imperfect construction, an attenuated and erroneous figure. And yet that which the universe and the individual seem to be is still a figure of what they really are, a figure that points beyond itself to the reality behind it. Truth proceeds by a correction of the values our mind and senses give us, and first by the action of a higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> that enlightens and sets right as far as may be the conclusions of the ignorant sense-mind and limited physical intelligence; that is the method of all human knowledge and science. But beyond it there is a knowledge, a Truth-consciousness, that exceeds our intellect and brings us into the true light of which it is a refracted ray. There the abstract terms of the pure reason and the constructions of the mind disappear or are converted into concrete soulvision and the tremendous actuality of spiritual experience. This knowledge can turn away to the absolute Eternal and lose vision of the soul and the universe; but it can too see this existence from that Eternal. When that is done, we find that the ignorance of the mind and the senses and all the apparent futilities of<span class='page-number' id='s-293' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.293]</span> human life were not a useless excursion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>, an otiose blunder. Here they were planned as a rough ground for the self-expression of the Soul that comes from the Infinite, a material foundation for its self-unfolding and self-possessing in the terms of the universe. It is true that in themselves they and all that is here have no significance and to build separate significances for them is to live in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>; but they have a supreme significance in the Supreme, an absolute Power in the Absolute and it is that that assigns to them and refers to that Truth their present relative values. This is the all-uniting experience that is the foundation of the deepest integral and most intimate self-knowledge and world-knowledge.\n\nIn relation to the individual the Supreme is our own true and highest self, that which ultimately we are in our essence, that of which we are in our manifested nature. A spiritual knowledge, moved to arrive at the true Self in us, must reject, as the traditional way of knowledge rejects, all misleading appearances. It must discover that the body is not our self, our foundation of existence; it is a sensible form of the Infinite. The experience of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> as the world's sole foundation and the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> and cells and molecules as the one truth of all things in us, the ponderous inadequate basis of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span>, is a delusion, a half-view taken for the whole, the dark bottom or shadow of things misconceived as the luminous substance, the effective figure of zero for the Integer. The materialist idea mistakes a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creative Power</span>, a means of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> for That which is expressed and expresses. Matter and our physical brain and nerves and body are the field and foundation for one action of a vital force that serves to connect the Self with the form of its works and maintains them by its direct dynamis. The material movements are an exterior notation by which the soul represents its perceptions of certain truths of the Infinite and makes them effective in the terms of Substance. These things are a language, a notation, a hieroglyphic, a system of symbols, not themselves the deepest truest sense of the things they intimate.\n\nNeither is the Life ourself, the vitality, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> which plays in the brain, nerves and body; it is a power and not the<span class='page-number' id='s-294' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.294]</span> whole power of the Infinite. The experience of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> instrumentalising Matter as the foundation, source and true sum of all things, the vibrating unsteady basis of vitalism, is a delusion, a half-view taken for the whole, a tide on a near shore misconceived as all the ocean and its waters. The vitalist idea takes something powerful but outward for the essence. Life-force is the dynamisation of a consciousness which exceeds it. That consciousness is felt and acts but does not become valid to us in intelligence until we arrive at the higher term of Mind, our present summit. Mind is here apparently a creation of Life, but it is really the ulterior—not the ultimate—sense of Life itself and what is behind it and a more conscious formulation of its secret; Mind is an expression not of Life, but of that of which Life itself is a less luminous expression.\n\nAnd yet Mind also, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, our thinking, understanding part, is not our Self, is not That, not the end or the beginning; it is a half-light thrown from the Infinite. The experience of mind as the creator of forms and things and of these forms and things existing in the Mind only, the thin subtle basis of idealism, is also a delusion, a half-view taken for the whole, a pale refracted light idealised as the burning body of the Sun and its splendour. This idealist vision also does not arrive at the essence of being, does not even touch it but only an inferior mode of Nature. Mind is the dubious outer penumbra of a conscious existence which is not limited by mentality but exceeds it. The method of the traditional way of knowledge, eliminating all these things, arrives at the conception and realisation of a pure conscious existence, self-aware, self-blissful, unconditioned by mind and life and body and to its ultimate positive experience that is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>, the Self, the original and essential nature of our existence. Here at last there is something centrally true, but in its haste to arrive at it this knowledge assumes that there is nothing between the thinking mind and the Highest, *buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ*, and, shutting its eyes in Samadhi, tries to rush through all that actually intervenes without even seeing these great and luminous kingdoms of the Spirit. Perhaps it arrives at its object, but only to fall asleep in the Infinite. Or, if it remains<span class='page-number' id='s-295' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.295]</span> awake, it is in the highest experience of the Supreme into which the self-annulling Mind can enter, but not in the supreme of the Supreme, Paratpara. The Mind can only be aware of the Self in a mentalised spiritual thinness, only of the mind-reflected Sachchidananda. The highest truth, the integral self-knowledge is not to be gained by this self-blinded leap into the Absolute but by a patient transit beyond the mind into the Truth-consciousness where the Infinite can be known, felt, seen, experienced in all the fullness of its unending riches. And there we discover this Self that we are to be not only a static tenuous vacant Atman but a great dynamic Spirit individual, universal and transcendent. That Self and Spirit cannot be expressed by the mind's abstract generalisations; all the inspired descriptions of the seers and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystics</span> cannot exhaust its contents and its splendours.\n\nIn relation to the universe the Supreme is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span>, the one Reality which is not only the spiritual material and conscious substance of all the ideas and forces and forms of the universe, but their origin, support and possessor, the cosmic and supracosmic Spirit. All the last terms to which we can reduce the universe, Force and Matter, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Name and Form</span>, Purusha and Prakriti, are still not entirely that which the universe really is, either in itself or its nature. As all that we are is the play and form, the mental, psychic, vital and physical expression of a supreme Self unconditioned by mind and life and body, the universe too is the play and form and cosmic soul-expression and nature-expression of a supreme Existence which is unconditioned by force and matter, unconditioned by idea and name and form, unconditioned by the fundamental distinction of Purusha and Prakriti. Our supreme Self and the supreme Existence which has become the universe are one Spirit, one self and one existence. The individual is in nature one expression of the universal Being, in spirit an emanation of the Transcendence. For if he finds his self, he finds too that his own true self is not this natural personality, this created <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, but is a universal being in its relations with others and with Nature and in its upward term a portion or the living front of a supreme transcendental Spirit.\n\nThis supreme Existence is not conditioned by the individual<span class='page-number' id='s-296' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.296]</span> or by the universe. A spiritual knowledge can therefore surpass or even eliminate these two powers of the Spirit and arrive at the conception of something utterly Transcendent, something that is unnameable and mentally unknowable, a sheer Absolute. The traditional way of knowledge eliminates individual and universe. The Absolute it seeks after is featureless, indefinable, relation-less, not this, not that, *neti neti*. And yet we can say of it that it is One, that it is Infinite, that it is ineffable Bliss, Consciousness, Existence. Although unknowable to the mind, yet through our individual being and through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> and forms of the universe we can approach the realisation of the supreme Self that is Brahman, and by the realisation of the self we come to a certain realisation also of this utter Absolute of which our true self is the essential form in our consciousness (*svarūpa*). These are the devices the human mind is compelled to use if it is to form to itself any conception at all of a transcendent and unconditioned Absolute. The system of negation is indispensable to it in order to get rid of its own definitions and limited experience; it is obliged to escape through a vague Indefinite into the Infinite. For it lives in a closed prison of constructions and representations that are necessary for its action but are not the self-existent truth either of Matter or Life or Mind or Spirit. But if we can once cross beyond the Mind's frontier twilight into the vast plane of supramental Knowledge, these devices cease to be indispensable. Supermind has quite another, a positive and direct and living experience of the supreme Infinite. The Absolute is beyond personality and beyond <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span>, and yet it is both the Impersonal and the supreme Person and all persons. The Absolute is beyond the distinction of unity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span>, and yet it is the One and the innumerable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> in all the universes. It is beyond all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> by quality and yet it is not limited by a qualitiless void but is too all infinite qualities. It is the individual soul and all souls and none of them; it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> Brahman and the universe. It is the cosmic and the supracosmic Spirit, the supreme Lord, the supreme Self, the supreme Purusha and supreme Shakti, the Ever Unborn who is endlessly born, the Infinite who is innumerably finite, the multitudinous<span class='page-number' id='s-297' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.297]</span> One, the complex Simple, the many-sided Single, the Word of the Silence Ineffable, the impersonal omnipresent Person, the Mystery translucent in highest consciousness to its own spirit, but to a lesser consciousness veiled in its own exceeding light and impenetrable for ever. These things are to the dimensional mind irreconcilable opposites, but to the constant vision and experience of the supramental Truth-consciousness they are so simply and inevitably the intrinsic nature of each other that even to think of them as contraries is an unimaginable violence. The walls constructed by the measuring and separating Intellect have disappeared and the Truth in its simplicity and beauty appears and reduces all to terms of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and unity and light. Dimensions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> remain but as figures for use, not a separative prison for the self-forgetting Spirit.\n\nThe consciousness of the transcendent Absolute with its consequence in individual and universe is the last, the eternal knowledge. Our minds may deal with it on various lines, may build upon it conflicting philosophies, may limit, modify, overstress, understress sides of the knowledge, deduce from it truth or error; but our intellectual variations and imperfect statements make no difference to the ultimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that if we push thought and experience to their end, this is the knowledge in which they terminate. The object of a Yoga of spiritual knowledge can be nothing else than this eternal Reality, this Self, this Brahman, this Transcendent that dwells over all and in all and is manifest yet concealed in the individual, manifest yet disguised in the universe.\n\nThe culmination of the path of knowledge need not necessarily entail extinction of our world-existence. For the Supreme to whom we assimilate ourselves, the Absolute and Transcendent into whom we enter has always the complete and ultimate consciousness for which we are seeking and yet he supports by it his play in the world. Neither are we compelled to believe that our world-existence ends because by attaining to knowledge its object or consummation is fulfilled and therefore there is nothing more for us here afterwards. For what we gain at first with its release and immeasurable silence and quietude is only the eternal<span class='page-number' id='s-298' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.298]</span> self-realisation by the individual in the essence of his conscious being; there will still remain on that foundation, unannulled by the silence, one with the release and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, the infinitely proceeding self-fulfilment of Brahman, its dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span></span> in the individual and by his presence, example and action in others and in the universe at large,—the work which the Great Ones remain to do. Our dynamic self-fulfilment cannot be worked out so long as we remain in the egoistic consciousness, in the mind's candle-lit darkness, in the bondage. Our present limited consciousness can only be a field of preparation, it can consummate nothing; for all that it manifests is marred through and through by an ego-ridden ignorance and error. The true and divine self-fulfilment of Brahman in the manifestation is only possible on the foundation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman-consciousness</span> and therefore through the acceptance of life by the liberated soul, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jivanmukta</span>.\n\nThis is the integral knowledge; for we know that everywhere and in all conditions all to the eye that sees is One, to a divine experience all is one block of the Divine. It is only the mind which for the temporary convenience of its own thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> seeks to cut an artificial line of rigid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> of perpetual incompatibility between one aspect and another of the eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. The liberated knower lives and acts in the world not less than the bound soul and ignorant mind but more, doing all actions, *sarvakṛt*, only with a true knowledge and a greater conscient power. And by so doing he does not forfeit the supreme unity nor fall from the supreme consciousness and the highest knowledge. For the Supreme, however hidden now to us, is here in the world no less than he could be in the most utter and ineffable self-extinction, the most intolerant Nirvana.<span class='page-number' id='s-299' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.299]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-object-of-knowledge","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Status of Knowledge","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-status-of-knowledge","prvt":"The Supermind and the Yoga of Works","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-supermind-and-the-yoga-of-works","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-status-of-knowledge"],"t":"The Status of Knowledge","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The self, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span>, the Supreme Reality, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span>, the Transcendent,—the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> in all these aspects is then the object of Yogic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>.

It becomes at once evident that the knowledge for which Yoga strives must be different from what men ordinarily understand by the word. For we mean ordinarily by knowledge an intellectual appreciation of the facts of life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and matter and the laws that govern them. This is a knowledge founded upon our sense-perception and upon reasoning from our sense-perceptions and it is undertaken partly for the pure satisfaction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, partly for practical efficiency and the added power which knowledge gives in managing our lives and the lives of others, in utilising for human ends the overt or secret forces of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> and in helping or hurting, in saving and ennobling or in oppressing and destroying our fellow-men. Yoga, indeed, is commensurate with all life and can include all these subjects and objects. There is even a Yoga[^1] which can be used for self-indulgence as well as for self-conquest, for hurting others as well as for their salvation. But \"all life\" includes not only, not even mainly life as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> now leads it.

Be it also noted that all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> is not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>.\n\nThis greater consciousness, this higher existence are not an enlightened or illumined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> supported by a greater dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> or supporting a purer moral life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. Their superiority to the ordinary human consciousness is not in degree but in kind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span>. There is a change not merely of the surface or instrumental manner of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> but of its very foundation and dynamic principle. Yogic knowledge seeks to enter into a secret consciousness <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> mind which is only occultly here, concealed at the basis of all existence. For it is that consciousness alone that truly knows and only by its possession can we possess <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and rightly know the world and its real nature and secret forces. All this world visible or sensible to us and all too in it that is not visible is merely the phenomenal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of something beyond the mind and the senses. The knowledge which the senses and intellectual reasoning from the data of the senses can bring us, is not true knowledge; it is a science of appearances. And even appearances cannot be properly known unless we know first the Reality of which they are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span>. This Reality is their self and there is one self of all; when that is seized, all other things can then be known in their truth and no longer as now only in their appearance.\n\nIt is evident that however much we may analyse the physical and sensible, we cannot by that means arrive at the knowledge of the Self or of ourselves or of that which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> God. The telescope, the microscope, the scalpel, the retort and alembic cannot go beyond the physical, although they may arrive at subtler and subtler truths about the physical. If then we confine ourselves to what the senses and their physical aids reveal to us and refuse from the beginning to admit any other reality or any other means of knowledge, we are obliged to conclude that nothing is real except the physical and that there is no Self in us or in the universe, no God within and without, no ourselves even except this aggregate of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. But this we are only obliged to conclude because we have assumed it firmly from the beginning and therefore cannot but circle round to our original assumption.<span class='page-number' id='s-301' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.301]</span>\n\nIf, then, there is a Self, a Reality not obvious to the senses, it must be by other means than those of physical Science that it is to be sought and known. The intellect is not that means. Undoubtedly there are a number of suprasensuous truths at which the intellect is able to arrive in its own manner and which it is able to perceive and state as intellectual conceptions. The very idea of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Force</span> for instance on which Science so much insists, is a conception, a truth at which the intellect alone can arrive by going beyond its data; for we do not sense this universal force but only its results, and the force itself we infer as a necessary cause of these results. So also the intellect by following a certain line of rigorous analysis can arrive at the intellectual conception and the intellectual conviction of the Self and this conviction can be very real, very luminous, very potent as the beginning of other and greater things. Still, in itself intellectual analysis can only lead to an arrangement of clear conceptions, perhaps to a right arrangement of true conceptions; but this is not the knowledge aimed at by Yoga. For it is not in itself an effective knowledge. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> may be perfect in it and yet be precisely what he was before except in the mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of the greater intellectual illumination. The change of our being at which Yoga <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>, may not at all take place.\n\nIt is true that intellectual deliberation and right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span> are an important part of the Yoga of knowledge; but their object is rather to remove a difficulty than to arrive at the final and positive result of this path. Our ordinary intellectual notions are a stumbling-block in the way of knowledge; for they are governed by the error of the senses and they found themselves on the notion that matter and body are the reality, that life and force are the reality, that passion and emotion, thought and sense are the reality; and with these things we identify ourselves, and because we identify ourselves with these things we cannot get back to the real self. Therefore, it is necessary for the seeker of knowledge to remove this stumbling-block and to get right notions about himself and the world; for how shall we pursue by knowledge the real self if we have no notion of what it is and are on the contrary burdened with ideas quite opposite to the truth?<span class='page-number' id='s-302' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.302]</span> Therefore right thought is a necessary preliminary, and once the habit of right thought is established, free from sense-error and desire and old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> and intellectual prejudgment, the understanding becomes purified and offers no serious obstacle to the farther process of knowledge. Still, right thought only becomes effective when in the purified understanding it is followed by other operations, by vision, by experience, by realisation.\n\nWhat are these operations? They are not mere psychological self-analysis and self-observation. Such analysis, such <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> are, like the process of right thought, of immense value and practically indispensable. They may even, if rightly pursued, lead to a right thought of considerable power and effectivity. Like intellectual discrimination by the process of meditative thought they will have an effect of purification; they will lead to self-knowledge of a certain kind and to the setting right of the disorders of the soul and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and even of the disorders of the understanding. Self-knowledge of all kinds is on the straight path to the knowledge of the real Self. The Upanishad tells us that the Self-existent has so set the doors of the soul that they turn outwards and most men look outward into the appearances of things; only the rare soul that is ripe for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> thought and steady wisdom turns its eye inward, sees the Self and attains to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. To this turning of the eye inward psychological self-observation and analysis is a great and effective introduction. We can look into the inward of ourselves more easily than we can look into the inward of things external to us because there, in things outside us, we are in the first place embarrassed by the form and secondly we have no natural previous experience of that in them which is other than their physical substance. A purified or tranquillised mind may reflect or a powerful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> may discover God in the world, the Self in Nature even before it is realised in ourselves, but this is rare and difficult.[^2] And it is only in ourselves that we can observe and know the<span class='page-number' id='s-303' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.303]</span> process of the Self in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> and follow the process by which it draws back into self-being. Therefore the ancient counsel, know thyself, will always stand as the first word that directs us towards *the* knowledge. Still, psychological self-knowledge is only the experience of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of the Self</span>, it is not the realisation of the Self in its pure being.\n\n[^2]: In one respect, however, it is easier, because in external things we are not so much hampered by the sense of the limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> as in ourselves; one obstacle to the realisation of God is therefore removed.\n\nThe status of knowledge, then, which Yoga envisages is not merely an intellectual conception or clear discrimination of the truth, nor is it an enlightened psychological experience of the modes of our being. It is a \"realisation\", in the full sense of the word; it is the making real to ourselves and in ourselves of the Self, the transcendent and universal Divine, and it is the subsequent impossibility of viewing the modes of being except in the light of that Self and in their true aspect as its flux of becoming under the psychical and physical conditions of our world-existence. This realisation consists of three successive movements, internal vision, complete internal experience and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>.\n\nThis internal vision, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dṛṣṭi</span>*, the power so highly valued by the ancient sages, the power which made a man a Rishi or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kavi</span> and no longer a mere thinker, is a sort of light in the soul by which things unseen become as evident and real to it—to the soul and not merely to the intellect—as do things seen to the physical eye. In the physical world there are always two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of knowledge, the direct and the indirect, *pratyakṣa*, of that which is present to the eyes, and *parokṣa*, of that which is remote from and beyond our vision. When the object is beyond our vision, we are necessarily obliged to arrive at an idea of it by inference, imagination, analogy, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> the descriptions of others who have seen it or by studying pictorial or other representations of it if these are available. By putting together all these aids we can indeed arrive at a more or less adequate idea or suggestive image of the object, but we do not realise the thing itself; it is not yet to us the grasped reality, but only our conceptual representation of a reality. But once we have seen it with the eyes,—for no other sense is adequate,—we possess, we realise; it is there secure in our satisfied being, part of ourselves in knowledge.<span class='page-number' id='s-304' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.304]</span> Precisely the same rule holds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of psychical things and of the Self. We may hear clear and luminous teachings about the Self from philosophers or teachers or from ancient writings; we may by thought, inference, imagination, analogy or by any other available means attempt to form a mental figure or conception of it; we may hold firmly that conception in our mind and fix it by an entire and exclusive concentration;[^3] but we have not yet realised it, we have not seen God. It is only when after long and persistent concentration or by other means the veil of the mind is rent or swept aside, only when a flood of light breaks over the awakened mentality, *jyotirmaya <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brahman</span>*, and conception gives place to a knowledge-vision in which the Self is as present, real, concrete as a physical object to the physical eye, that we possess in knowledge; for we have seen. After that revelation, whatever fadings of the light, whatever periods of darkness may afflict the soul, it can never irretrievably lose what it has once held. The experience is inevitably renewed and must become more frequent till it is constant; when and how soon depends on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> and persistence with which we insist on the path and besiege by our will or our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> the hidden <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Deity</span>.\n\n[^3]: This is the idea of the triple operation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jnanayoga</span>, *śravaṇa, manana, nididhyāsana*, hearing, thinking or mentalising and fixing in concentration.\n\nThis <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner vision</span> is one form of psychological experience; but the inner experience is not confined to that seeing; vision only opens, it does not embrace. Just as the eye, though it is alone adequate to bring the first sense of realisation, has to call in the aid of experience by the touch and other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> of sense before there is an embracing knowledge, so the vision of the self ought to be completed by an experience of it in all our members. Our whole being ought to demand God and not only our illumined eye of knowledge. For since each principle in us is only a manifestation of the Self, each can get back to its reality and have the experience of it. We can have a mental experience of the Self and seize as concrete realities all those apparently abstract things that to the mind constitute existence—consciousness, force, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> and their manifold forms and workings: thus the<span class='page-number' id='s-305' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.305]</span> mind is satisfied of God. We can have an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional experience of the Self</span> through Love and through emotional delight, love and delight of the Self in us, of the Self in the universal and of the Self in all with whom we have relations: thus the heart is satisfied of God. We can have an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic experience of the Self</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, a delight-perception and taste of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> reality all-beautiful in everything whether created by ourselves or Nature in its appeal to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aesthetic mind</span> and the senses; thus the sense is satisfied of God. We can have even the vital, nervous experience and practically the physical sense of the Self in all life and formation and in all workings of powers, forces, energies that operate through us or others or in the world: thus the life and the body are satisfied of God.\n\nAll this knowledge and experience are primary means of arriving at and of possessing identity. It is our self that we see and experience and therefore vision and experience are incomplete unless they culminate in identity, unless we are able to live in all our being the supreme Vedantic knowledge, He am I. We must not only see God and embrace Him, but become that Reality. We must become one with the Self in its transcendence of all form and manifestation by the resolution, the sublimation, the escape from itself of ego and all its belongings into That from which they proceed, as well as become the Self in all its manifested existences and becomings, one with it in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> existence, consciousness, peace, delight by which it reveals itself in us and one with it in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, formation, play of self-conception with which it garbs itself in the world.\n\nIt is difficult for the modern mind to understand how we can do more than conceive intellectually of the Self or of God; but it may borrow some shadow of this vision, experience and becoming from that inner awakening to Nature which a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> poet has made a reality to the European imagination. If we read the poems in which Wordsworth expressed his realisation of Nature, we may acquire some distant idea of what realisation is. For, first, we see that he had the vision of something in the world which is the very Self of all things that it contains, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> and presence other than its forms, yet cause of its forms<span class='page-number' id='s-306' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.306]</span> and manifested in them. We perceive that he had not only the vision of this and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and peace and universality which its presence brings, but the very sense of it, mental, aesthetic, vital, physical; not only this sense and vision of it in its own being but in the nearest flower and simplest man and the immobile rock; and, finally, that he even occasionally attained to that unity, that becoming the object of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span>, one phase of which is powerfully and profoundly expressed in the poem \"A slumber did my spirit seal,\" where he describes himself as become one in his being with earth, \"rolled round in its diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees.\" Exalt this realisation to a profounder Self than physical Nature and we have the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of the Yogic knowledge. But all this experience is only the vestibule to that suprasensuous, supramental realisation of the Transcendent who is beyond all His aspects, and the final summit of knowledge can only be attained by entering into the superconscient and there merging all other experience into a supernal unity with the Ineffable. That is the culmination of all divine knowing; that also is the source of all divine delight and divine living.\n\nThat status of knowledge is then the aim of this path and indeed of all paths when pursued to their end, to which intellectual discrimination and conception and all concentration and psychological self-knowledge and all seeking by the heart through love and by the senses through beauty and by the will through power and works and by the soul through peace and joy are only keys, avenues, first approaches and beginnings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> which we have to use and to follow till the wide and infinite levels are attained and the divine doors swing open into the infinite Light.<span class='page-number' id='s-307' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.307]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-status-of-knowledge","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Purified Understanding","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-purified-understanding","prvt":"The Object of Knowledge","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-object-of-knowledge","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-purified-understanding"],"t":"The Purified Understanding","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The description of the status of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> to which we aspire, determines the means of knowledge which we shall use. That status of knowledge may be summed up as a supramental realisation which is prepared by mental representations through various mental principles in us and once attained again reflects itself more perfectly in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the members of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>.

There is indeed no rigid line of demarcation in sequence of Time between these two stages; rather they are necessary to each other and continue simultaneously. For in proportion as the soul becomes fit it increases in illumination and rises to higher and higher, completer and completer realisations, and in proportion as these illuminations and these realisations increase, becomes fit and its instruments more adequate to their task: there are soul-seasons of unillumined preparation and soul-seasons of illumined growth and culminating soul-moments more or less prolonged of illumined possession, moments that are transient like the flash of the lightning, yet change the whole spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, moments also that extend over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> human hours, days, weeks in a constant light or blaze of the Sun of Truth.

An unpurified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, an unpurified sense, an unpurified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> confuse the understanding, disturb its data, distort its conclusions, darken its seeing, misapply its knowledge; an unpurified physical system clogs or chokes up its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. There must be an integral purity. Here also there is an interdependence; for the purification of each member of our being profits by the clarifying of every other, the progressive tranquillisation of the emotional heart helping for instance the purification of the understanding while equally a purified understanding imposes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and light on the turbid and darkened workings of the yet impure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>. It may even be said that while each member of our being has its own proper principles of purification, yet it is the purified understanding that in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is the most potent cleanser of his turbid and disordered being and most sovereignly imposes their right working on his other members. Knowledge, says the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, is the sovereign purity; light is the source of all clearness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> even as the darkness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> is the cause of all our stumblings. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>, for example, is the purifier of the heart and by reducing all our emotions into terms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> the heart is perfected and fulfilled; yet love itself needs to be clarified by divine knowledge. The heart's love of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> may be blind, narrow and ignorant and lead to fanaticism and obscurantism; it may, even when otherwise pure, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> our perfection by refusing to see Him except in a limited personality and by recoiling from the true and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> vision. The heart's love of man may equally lead to distortions and exaggerations in feeling, action and knowledge which have to be corrected and prevented by the purification of the understanding.\n\nWe must, however, consider deeply and clearly what we mean by the understanding and by its purification. We use the<span class='page-number' id='s-309' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.309]</span> word as the nearest equivalent we can get in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> tongue to the Sanskrit philosophical term *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>buddhi</span>*; therefore we exclude from it the action of the sense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> which merely consists of the recording of perceptions of all kinds without distinction whether they be right or wrong, true or mere illusory phenomena, penetrating or superficial. We exclude that mass of confused conception which is merely a rendering of these perceptions and is equally void of the higher principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span>. Nor can we include that constant leaping current of habitual thought which does <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> for understanding in the mind of the average unthinking man, but is only a constant repetition of habitual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, prejudices, prejudgments, received or inherited preferences, even though it may constantly enrich itself by a fresh stock of concepts streaming in from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> and admitted without the challenge of the sovereign discriminating reason. Undoubtedly this is a sort of understanding which has been very useful in the development of man from the animal; but it is only one remove above the animal mind; it is a half-animal reason subservient to habit, to desire and the senses and is of no avail in the search whether for scientific or philosophical or spiritual knowledge. We have to go <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> it; its purification can only be effected either by dismissing or silencing it altogether or by transmuting it into the true understanding.\n\nBy the understanding we mean that which at once perceives, judges and discriminates, the true reason of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> not subservient to the senses, to desire or to the blind <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of habit, but working in its own right for mastery, for knowledge. Certainly, the reason of man as he is at present does not even at its best act entirely in this free and sovereign fashion; but so far as it fails, it fails because it is still mixed with the lower half-animal action, because it is impure and constantly hampered and pulled down from its characteristic action. In its purity it should not be involved in these lower movements, but stand back from the object, and observe disinterestedly, put it in its right place in the whole by force of comparison, contrast, analogy, reason from its rightly observed data by deduction, induction, inference and<span class='page-number' id='s-310' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.310]</span> holding all its gains in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> and supplementing them by a chastened and rightly-guided imagination view all in the light of a trained and disciplined judgment. Such is the pure intellectual understanding of which disinterested <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span>, judgment and reasoning are the law and characterising action.\n\nBut the term *buddhi* is also used in another and profounder sense. The intellectual understanding is only the lower *buddhi*; there is another and a higher *buddhi* which is not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> but vision, is not understanding but rather an over-standing[^1] in knowledge, and does not seek knowledge and attain it in subjection to the data it observes but possesses already the truth and brings it out in the terms of a revelatory and intuitional thought. The nearest the human mind usually gets to this truth-conscious knowledge is that imperfect action of illumined finding which occurs when there is a great stress of thought and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> electrified by constant discharges from behind the veil and yielding to a higher enthusiasm admits a considerable instreaming from the intuitive and inspired faculty of knowledge. For there is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> in man which serves as a recipient and channel for these instreamings from a supramental faculty. But the action of intuition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> in us is imperfect in kind as well as intermittent in action; ordinarily, it comes in response to a claim from the labouring and struggling heart or intellect and, even before its givings enter the conscious mind, they are already affected by the thought or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> which went up to meet them, are no longer pure but altered to the needs of the heart or intellect; and after they enter the conscious mind, they are immediately seized upon by the intellectual understanding and dissipated or broken up so as to fit in with our imperfect intellectual knowledge, or by the heart and remoulded to suit our blind or half-blind emotional longings and preferences, or even by the lower cravings and distorted to the vehement uses of our hungers and passions.\n\n[^1]: The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Being</span> is described as the *adhyakṣa*, he who seated over all in the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> over-sees things, views and controls them from above.\n\nIf this higher *buddhi* could act pure of the interference of<span class='page-number' id='s-311' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.311]</span> these lower members, it would give pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of the truth; observation would be dominated or replaced by a vision which could see without subservient dependence on the testimony of the sense-mind and senses; imagination would give place to the self-assured inspiration of the truth, reasoning to the spontaneous discernment of relations and conclusion from reasoning to an intuition containing in itself those relations and not building laboriously upon them, judgment to a thought-vision in whose light the truth would stand revealed without the mask which it now wears and which our intellectual judgment has to penetrate; while memory too would take upon itself that larger sense given to it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> thought and be no longer a paltry selection from the store gained by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> in his present life, but rather the all-recording knowledge which secretly holds and constantly gives from itself everything that we now seem painfully to acquire but really in this sense remember, a knowledge which includes the future[^2] no less than the past. Certainly, we are intended to grow in our receptivity to this higher faculty of truth-conscious knowledge, but its full and unveiled use is as yet the privilege of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> and beyond our present human stature.\n\n[^2]: In this sense the power of prophecy has been aptly called a memory of the future.\n\nWe see then what we mean precisely by the understanding and by that higher faculty which we may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> for the sake of convenience the ideal faculty and which stands to the developed intellect much in the same relation as that intellect stands to the half-animal reason of the undeveloped man. It becomes evident also what is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the purification which is necessary before the understanding can fulfil rightly its part in the attainment of right knowledge. All impurity is a confusion of working, a departure from the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>*, the just and inherently right action of things which in that right action are pure and helpful to our perfection and this departure is usually the result of an ignorant confusion[^3] of dharmas in which the function lends itself to the demand of other tendencies than those which are properly its own.<span class='page-number' id='s-312' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.312]</span>\n\n[^3]: *saṅkara.*\n\nThe first cause of impurity in the understanding is the intermiscence of desire in the thinking functions, and desire itself is an impurity of the Will involved in the vital and emotional parts of our being. When the vital and emotional desires interfere with the pure will-to-know, the thought-function becomes subservient to them, pursues ends other than those proper to itself and its perceptions are clogged and deranged. The understanding must lift itself beyond the siege of desire and emotion and, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that it may have perfect immunity, it must get the vital parts and the emotions themselves purified. The will to enjoy is proper to the vital being but not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> or the reaching after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> which must be determined and acquired by higher functions; therefore the vital being must be trained to accept whatever gain or enjoyment comes to it in the right functioning of the life in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to the working of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> and to rid itself of craving and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span>. Similarly the heart must be freed from subjection to the cravings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-principle</span> and the senses and thus rid itself of the false emotions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>, wrath, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, lust, etc. which constitute the chief impurity of the heart. The will to love is proper to the heart, but here also the choice and reaching after love have to be foregone or tranquillised and the heart taught to love with depth and intensity indeed, but with a calm depth and a settled and equal, not a troubled and disordered intensity. The tranquillisation and mastery[^4] of these members is a first condition for the immunity of the understanding from error, ignorance and perversion. This purification spells an entire equality of the nervous being and the heart; equality, therefore, even as it was the first word of the path of works, so also is the first word of the path of knowledge.\n\n[^4]: *śama and dama.*\n\nThe second cause of impurity in the understanding is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of the senses and the intermiscence of the sense-mind in the thinking functions. No knowledge can be true knowledge which subjects itself to the senses or uses them otherwise than as first indices whose data have constantly to be corrected and overpassed. The beginning of Science is the examination of the truths<span class='page-number' id='s-313' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.313]</span> of the world-force that underlie its apparent workings such as our senses represent them to be; the beginning of philosophy is the examination of the principles of things which the senses mistranslate to us; the beginning of spiritual knowledge is the refusal to accept the limitations of the sense-life or to take the visible and sensible as anything more than phenomenon of the Reality.\n\nEqually must the sense-mind be stilled and taught to leave the function of thought to the mind that judges and understands. When the understanding in us stands back from the action of the sense-mind and repels its intermiscence, the latter detaches itself from the understanding and can be watched in its separate action. It then reveals itself as a constantly swirling and eddying undercurrent of habitual concepts, associations, perceptions, desires without any real sequence, order or principle of light. It is a constant repetition in a circle unintelligent and unfruitful. Ordinarily the human understanding accepts this undercurrent and tries to reduce it to a partial order and sequence; but by so doing it becomes itself subject to it and partakes of that disorder, restlessness, unintelligent subjection to habit and blind purposeless repetition which makes the ordinary human reason a misleading, limited and even frivolous and futile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>. There is nothing to be done with this fickle, restless, violent and disturbing factor but to get rid of it whether by detaching it and then reducing it to stillness or by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> and singleness to the thought by which it will of itself reject this alien and confusing element.\n\nA third cause of impurity has its source in the understanding itself and consists in an improper action of the will to know. That will is proper to the understanding, but here again choice and unequal reaching after knowledge clog and distort. They lead to a partiality and attachment which makes the intellect cling to certain ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> with a more or less obstinate will to ignore the truth in other ideas and opinions, cling to certain fragments of a truth and shy against the admission of other parts which are yet necessary to its fullness, cling to certain predilections of knowledge and repel all knowledge that does not<span class='page-number' id='s-314' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.314]</span> agree with the personal temperament of thought which has been acquired by the past of the thinker. The remedy lies in a perfect equality of the mind, in the cultivation of an entire intellectual rectitude and in the perfection of mental disinterestedness. The purified understanding as it will not lend itself to any desire or craving, so will not lend itself either to any predilection or distaste for any particular idea or truth, and will refuse to be attached even to those ideas of which it is the most certain or to lay on them such an undue stress as is likely to disturb the balance of truth and depreciate the values of other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of a complete and perfect knowledge.\n\nAn understanding thus purified would be a perfectly flexible, entire and faultless instrument of intellectual thought and being free from the inferior sources of obstruction and distortion would be capable of as true and complete a perception of the truths of the Self and the universe as the intellect can attain. But for real knowledge something more is necessary, since real knowledge is by our very definition of it supra-intellectual. In order that the understanding may not interfere with our attainment to real knowledge, we have to reach to that something more and cultivate a power exceedingly difficult for the active intellectual thinker and distasteful to his proclivities, the power of intellectual passivity. The object served is double and therefore two different kinds of passivity have to be acquired.\n\nIn the first place we have seen that intellectual thought is in itself inadequate and is not the highest thinking; the highest is that which comes through the intuitive mind and from the supramental faculty. So long as we are dominated by the intellectual habit and by the lower workings, the intuitive mind can only send its messages to us subconsciously and subject to a distortion more or less entire before it reaches the conscious mind; or if it works consciously, then only with an inadequate rarity and a great imperfection in its functioning. In order to strengthen the higher knowledge-faculty in us we have to effect the same separation between the intuitive and intellectual elements of our thought as we have already effected between the understanding and the sense-mind; and this is no easy task, for<span class='page-number' id='s-315' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.315]</span> not only do our intuitions come to us incrusted in the intellectual action, but there are a great number of mental workings which masquerade and ape the appearances of the higher faculty. The remedy is to train first the intellect to recognise the true intuition, to distinguish it from the false and then to accustom it, when it arrives at an intellectual perception or conclusion, to attach no final value to it, but rather look upward, refer all to the divine principle and wait in as complete a silence as it can command for the light from above. In this way it is possible to transmute a great part of our intellectual thinking into the luminous truth-conscious vision,—the ideal would be a complete transition,—or at least to increase greatly the frequency, purity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> of the ideal knowledge working behind the intellect. The latter must learn to be subject and passive to the ideal faculty.\n\nBut for the knowledge of the Self it is necessary to have the power of a complete intellectual passivity, the power of dismissing all thought, the power of the mind to think not at all which the Gita in one passage enjoins. This is a hard saying for the occidental mind to which thought is the highest thing and which will be apt to mistake the power of the mind not to think, its complete silence for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> of thought. But this power of silence is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> and not an incapacity, a power and not a weakness. It is a profound and pregnant stillness. Only when the mind is thus entirely still, like clear, motionless and level water, in a perfect purity and peace of the whole being and the soul transcends thought, can the Self which exceeds and originates all activities and becomings, the Silence from which all words are born, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span> of which all relativities are partial reflections manifest itself in the pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of our being. In a complete silence only is the Silence heard; in a pure peace only is its Being revealed. Therefore to us the name of That is the Silence and the Peace.<span class='page-number' id='s-316' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.316]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-purified-understanding","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Concentration","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/concentration","prvt":"The Status of Knowledge","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-status-of-knowledge","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["concentration"],"t":"Concentration","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A long with purity and as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to bring it about, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span>.

Their opposites are also closely connected; for we have seen that impurity is a confusion of dharmas, a lax, mixed and mutually entangled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the different parts of the being; and this confusion proceeds from an absence of right concentration of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> on its energies in the embodied Soul. The fault of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> is first an inert subjection to the impacts of things[^1] as they come in upon the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> pell-mell without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> or control and then a haphazard imperfect concentration managed fitfully, irregularly with a more or less <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> emphasis on this or on that object according as they happen to interest, not the higher soul or the judging and discerning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, but the restless, leaping, fickle, easily tired, easily distracted lower mind which is the chief enemy of our progress. In such a condition purity, the right working of the functions, the clear, unstained and luminous order of the being is an impossibility; the various workings, given over to the chances of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> and external influences, must necessarily run into each other and clog, divert, distract, pervert. Equally, without purity the complete, equal, flexible concentration of the being in right thought, right will, right feeling or secure status of spiritual experience is not possible.

It means that removal of the thought from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> distracting activities of the mind and that concentration of it on the idea of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> by which the soul rises out of the phenomenal into the one Reality. It is by the thought that we dissipate ourselves in the phenomenal; it is by the gathering back of the thought into itself that we must draw ourselves back into the real. Concentration has three powers by which this aim can be effected. By concentration on anything whatsoever we are able to know that thing, to make it deliver up its concealed secrets; we must use this power to know not things, but the one Thing-in-itself. By concentration again the whole will can be gathered up for the acquisition of that which is still ungrasped, still <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> us; this power, if it is sufficiently trained, sufficiently single-minded, sufficiently sincere, sure of itself, faithful to itself alone, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, we can use for the acquisition of any object whatsoever; but we ought to use it not for the acquisition of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> which the world offers to us, but to grasp spiritually that one object worthy of pursuit which is also the one subject worthy of knowledge. By concentration of our whole being on one status of itself, we can become whatever we choose; we can become, for instance, even if we were before a mass of weaknesses and fears, a mass instead of strength and courage, or we can become all a great purity, holiness and peace or a single universal soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>; but we ought, it is said, to use this power to become not even these things, high as they may be in comparison with what we now are, but rather to become that which is above all things and free from all action and attributes, the pure and absolute Being. All else, all other concentration can only be valuable for preparation, for previous steps, for a gradual training of the dissolute and self-dissipating thought, will and being towards their grand and unique object.\n\nThis use of concentration implies like every other a previous purification; it implies also in the end a renunciation, a cessation<span class='page-number' id='s-318' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.318]</span> and lastly an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into the absolute and transcendent state of Samadhi from which if it culminates, if it endures, there is, except perhaps for one soul out of many thousands, no return. For by that we go to the \"supreme state of the Eternal whence souls revert not\" into the cyclic action of Nature;[^2] and it is into this Samadhi that the Yogin who <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> at release from the world seeks to pass away at the time of leaving his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. We see this succession in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of the Rajayoga. For first the Rajayogin must arrive at a certain moral and spiritual purity; he must get rid of the lower or downward activities of his mind, but afterwards he must stop all its activities and concentrate himself in the one idea that leads from activity to the quiescence of status. The Rajayogic concentration has several stages, that in which the object is seized, that in which it is held, that in which the mind is lost in the status which the object represents or to which the concentration leads, and only the last is termed Samadhi in the Rajayoga although the word is capable, as in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>, of a much wider sense. But in the Rajayogic Samadhi there are different grades of status,—that in which the mind, though lost to outward objects, still <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>muses</span>, thinks, perceives in the world of thought, that in which the mind is still capable of primary thought-formations and that in which, all out-darting of the mind even within itself having ceased, the soul rises beyond thought into the silence of the Incommunicable and Ineffable. In all Yoga there are indeed many preparatory objects of thought-concentration, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, verbal formulas of thought, significant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span>, all of which are supports[^3] to the mind in this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, all of which have to be used and transcended; the highest support according to the Upanishads is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> syllable AUM, whose three letters represent the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> or Supreme Self in its three degrees of status, the Waking Soul, the Dream Soul and the Sleep Soul, and the whole potent sound rises towards that which is beyond status as beyond activity.[^4]<span class='page-number' id='s-319' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.319]</span> For of all Yoga of knowledge the final <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> is the Transcendent.\n\n[^2]: *yato naiva nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama.*\n\n[^3]: *avalambana.*\n\n[^4]: Mandukya Upanishad.\n\nWe have, however, conceived as the aim of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> something more complex and less exclusive—less exclusively positive of the highest condition of the soul, less exclusively negative of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> radiations. We must aim indeed at the Highest, the Source of all, the Transcendent but not to the exclusion of that which it transcends, rather as the source of an established experience and supreme state of the soul which shall transform all other states and remould our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of the world into the form of its secret Truth. We do not seek to excise from our being all consciousness of the universe, but to realise <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, Truth and Self in the universe as well as transcendent of it. We shall seek therefore not only the Ineffable, but also His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> being, consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> embracing the universe and at play in it. For that triune <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> is His supreme manifestation and that we shall aspire to know, to share in and to become; and since we seek to realise this Trinity not only in itself but in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> play, we shall aspire also to knowledge of and participation in the universal divine Truth, Knowledge, Will, Love which are His secondary manifestation, His divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>. With this too we shall aspire to identify ourselves, towards this too we shall strive to rise and, when the period of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> is passed, allow it by our renunciation of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> to draw us up into itself in our being and to descend into us and embrace us in all our becoming. This not only as a means of approach and passage to His supreme transcendence, but as the condition, even when we possess and are possessed by the Transcendent, of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span></span> in the manifestation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>.\n\nIn order that we may do this, the terms concentration and Samadhi must assume for us a richer and profound meaning. All our concentration is merely an image of the divine Tapas by which the Self dwells gathered in itself, by which it manifests within itself, by which it maintains and possesses its manifestation, by which it draws back from all manifestation into its supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. Being dwelling in consciousness upon itself for bliss, this is the divine Tapas; and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge-Will</span> dwelling<span class='page-number' id='s-320' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.320]</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of consciousness on itself and its manifestations is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the divine concentration, the Yoga of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of Yoga. Given the self-differentiation of the Divine in which we dwell, concentration is the means by which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> soul identifies itself with and enters into any form, state or psychological self-manifestation (*bhāva*) of the Self. To use this means for unification with the Divine is the condition for the attainment of divine knowledge and the principle of all Yoga of knowledge.\n\nThis concentration proceeds by the Idea, using thought, form and name as keys which yield up to the concentrating mind the Truth that lies concealed behind all thought, form and name; for it is through the Idea that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> rises beyond all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> to that which is expressed, to that of which the Idea itself is only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>. By concentration upon the Idea the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> which at present we are breaks open the barrier of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> and arrives at the state of consciousness, the state of being, the state of power of conscious-being and bliss of conscious-being to which the Idea corresponds and of which it is the symbol, movement and rhythm. Concentration by the Idea is, then, only a means, a key to open to us the superconscient planes of our existence; a certain self-gathered state of our whole existence lifted into that superconscient truth, unity and infinity of self-aware, self-blissful existence is the aim and culmination; and that is the meaning we shall give to the term Samadhi. Not merely a state withdrawn from all consciousness of the outward, withdrawn even from all consciousness of the inward into that which exists beyond both whether as seed of both or transcendent even of their seed-state; but a settled existence in the One and Infinite, united and identified with it, and this status to remain whether we abide in the waking condition in which we are conscious of the forms of things or we withdraw into the inward activity which dwells in the play of the principles of things, the play of their names and typal forms or we soar to the condition of static inwardness where we arrive at the principles themselves and at the principle of all principles, the seed of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span>.[^5]<span class='page-number' id='s-321' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.321]</span> For the soul that has arrived at the essential Samadhi and is settled in it (*samādhistha*) in the sense the Gita attaches to the word, has that which is fundamental to all experience and cannot fall from it by any experience however distracting to one who has not yet ascended the summit. It can embrace all in the scope of its being without being bound by any or deluded or limited.\n\n[^5]: The Waking, Dream and Sleep states of the soul.\n\nWhen we arrive at this state, all our being and consciousness being concentrated, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of concentration in the Idea ceases. For there in that supramental state the whole position of things is reversed. The mind is a thing that dwells in diffusion, in succession; it can only concentrate on one thing at a time and when not concentrated runs from one thing to another very much at random. Therefore it has to concentrate on a single idea, a single subject of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span>, a single object of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span>, a single object of will in order to possess or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> it, and this it must do to at least the temporary exclusion of all others. But that which is beyond the mind and into which we seek to rise is superior to the running process of the thought, superior to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> of ideas. The Divine is centred in itself and when it throws out ideas and activities does not divide itself or imprison itself in them, but holds them and their movement in its infinity; undivided, its whole self is behind each Idea and each movement and at the same time behind all of them together. Held by it, each spontaneously works itself out, not through a separate act of will, but by the general force of consciousness behind it; if to us there seems to be a concentration of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> and Knowledge in each, it is a multiple and equal and not an exclusive concentration, and the reality of it is rather a free and spontaneous working in a self-gathered unity and infinity. The soul which has risen to the divine Samadhi participates in the measure of its attainment in this reversed condition of things,—the true condition, for that which is the reverse of our mentality is the truth. It is for this reason that, as is said in the ancient books, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who has arrived at Self-possession attains spontaneously without the need of concentration in thought and effort the knowledge or the result which the Idea or the Will in him moves out to embrace.<span class='page-number' id='s-322' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.322]</span>\n\nTo arrive then at this settled divine status must be the object of our concentration. The first step in concentration must be always to accustom the discursive mind to a settled unwavering pursuit of a single course of connected thought on a single subject and this it must do undistracted by all lures and alien calls on its attention. Such concentration is common enough in our ordinary life, but it becomes more difficult when we have to do it inwardly without any outward object or action on which to keep the mind; yet this inward concentration is what the seeker of knowledge must effect.[^6] Nor must it be merely the consecutive thought of the intellectual thinker, whose only object is to conceive and intellectually link together his conceptions. It is not, except perhaps at first, a process of reasoning that is wanted so much as a dwelling so far as possible on the fruitful essence of the idea which by the insistence of the soul's will upon it must yield up all the facets of its truth. Thus if it be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Love</span> that is the subject of concentration, it is on the essence of the idea of God as Love that the mind should concentrate in such a way that the various manifestation of the divine Love should arise luminously, not only to the thought, but in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and being and vision of the sadhaka. The thought may come first and the experience afterwards, but equally the experience may come first and the knowledge arise out of the experience. Afterwards the thing attained has to be dwelt on and more and more held till it becomes a constant experience and finally the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span> or law of the being.\n\n[^6]: In the elementary stages of internal debate and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span>, *vitarka* and *vicāra*, for the correction of false ideas and arrival at the intellectual truth.\n\nThis is the process of concentrated meditation; but a more strenuous method is the fixing of the whole mind in concentration on the essence of the idea only, so as to reach not the thought-knowledge or the psychological experience of the subject, but the very essence of the thing behind the idea. In this process thought ceases and passes into the absorbed or ecstatic contemplation of the object or by a merging into it in an inner Samadhi. If this be the process followed, then subsequently the<span class='page-number' id='s-323' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.323]</span> state into which we rise must still be called down to take possession of the lower being, to shed its light, power and bliss on our ordinary consciousness. For otherwise we may possess it, as many do, in the elevated condition or in the inward Samadhi, but we shall lose our hold of it when we awake or descend into the contacts of the world; and this truncated possession is not the aim of an integral Yoga.\n\nA third process is neither at first to concentrate in a strenuous meditation on the one subject nor in a strenuous contemplation of the one object of thought-vision, but first to still the mind altogether. This may be done by various ways; one is to stand back from the mental action altogether not participating in but simply watching it until, tired of its unsanctioned leaping and running, it falls into an increasing and finally an absolute quiet. Another is to reject the thought-suggestions, to cast them away from the mind whenever they come and firmly hold to the peace of the being which really and always exists behind the trouble and riot of the mind. When this secret peace is unveiled, a great calm settles on the being and there comes usually with it the perception and experience of the all-pervading silent Brahman, everything else at first seeming to be mere form and eidolon. On the basis of this calm everything else may be built up in the knowledge and experience no longer of the external phenomena of things but of the deeper truth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine manifestation</span>.\n\nOrdinarily, once this state is obtained, strenuous concentration will be found no longer necessary. A free concentration of will[^7] using thought merely for suggestion and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> of light to the lower members will take its place. This Will will then insist on the physical being, the vital existence, the heart and the mind remoulding themselves in the forms of the Divine which reveal themselves out of the silent Brahman. By swifter or slower degrees according to the previous preparation and purification of the members, they will be obliged with more or less struggle to obey the law of the will and its thought-suggestion, so that<span class='page-number' id='s-324' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.324]</span> eventually the knowledge of the Divine takes possession of our consciousness on all its planes and the image of the Divine is formed in our human existence even as it was done by the old Vedic Sadhakas.

Renunciation is an indispensable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of our perfection.\n\nHow far shall this renunciation go? what shall be its nature? and in what way shall it be applied? There is an established tradition long favoured by great religious teachings and by men of profound spiritual experience that renunciation must not only be complete as a discipline but definite and final as an end and that it shall fall nothing short of the renunciation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> itself and of our mundane <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> causes have contributed to the growth of this pure, lofty and august tradition. There is first the profounder cause of the radical opposition between the sullied and imperfect nature of life in the world as it now is in the present stage of our human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> and the nature of spiritual living; and this opposition has led to the entire rejection of world-existence as a lie, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>insanity</span> of the soul, a troubled and unhappy dream or at best a flawed, specious and almost worthless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> or to its characterisation as a kingdom of the world, the flesh and the devil, and therefore for the divinely led and divinely attracted soul only a place of ordeal and preparation or at best a play of the All-existence, a game of cross-purposes which He tires of and abandons. A second cause is the soul's<span class='page-number' id='s-326' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.326]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span> for personal salvation, for escape into some farther or farthest height of unalloyed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> and peace untroubled by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> and the struggle; or else it is its unwillingness to return from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of the divine embrace into the lower field of work and service. But there are other slighter causes incidental to spiritual experience,—strong feeling and practical proof of the great difficulty, which we willingly exaggerate into an impossibility, of combining the life of works and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> with spiritual peace and the life of realisation; or else the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> comes to take in the mere act and state of renunciation,—as it comes indeed to take joy in anything that it has attained or to which it has inured itself,—and the sense of peace and deliverance which is gained by indifference to the world and to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>'s desire. Lowest causes of all are the weakness that shrinks from the struggle, the disgust and disappointment of the soul baffled by the great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> labour, the selfishness that cares not what becomes of those left behind us so long as we personally can be free from the monstrous ever-circling wheel of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> and rebirth, the indifference to the cry that rises up from a labouring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>.\n\nFor the sadhaka of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> none of these reasons are valid. With weakness and selfishness, however spiritual in their guise or trend, he can have no dealings; a divine strength and courage and a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> and helpfulness are the very stuff of that which he would be, they are that very nature of the Divine which he would take upon himself as a robe of spiritual light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>. The revolvings of the great wheel bring to him no sense of terror or giddiness; he rises above it in his soul and knows from above their divine law and their divine purpose. The difficulty of harmonising the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine life</span> with human living, of being in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and yet living in man is the very difficulty that he is set here to solve and not to shun. He has learned that the joy, the peace and the deliverance are an imperfect crown and no real possession if they do not form a state secure in itself, inalienable to the soul, not dependent on aloofness and inaction but firm in the storm and the race and the battle, unsullied whether by the joy of the world or by its suffering. The ecstasy of the divine<span class='page-number' id='s-327' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.327]</span> embrace will not abandon him because he obeys the impulse of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> for God in humanity; or if it seems to draw back from him for a while, he knows by experience that it is to try and test him still farther so that some imperfection in his own way of meeting it may fall away from him. Personal salvation he does not seek except as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> for the human fulfilment and because he who is himself in bonds cannot easily free others,—though to God nothing is impossible; for a heaven of personal joys he has no hankerings even as a hell of personal sufferings has for him no terrors. If there is an opposition between the spiritual life and that of the world, it is that gulf which he is here to bridge, that opposition which he is here to change into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span>. If the world is ruled by the flesh and the devil, all the more reason that the children of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Immortality</span> should be here to conquer it for God and the Spirit. If life is an insanity, then there are so many million souls to whom there must be brought the light of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine reason</span>; if a dream, yet is it real within itself to so many dreamers who must be brought either to dream nobler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span> or to awaken; or if a lie, then the truth has to be given to the deluded. Nor, if it be said that only by the luminous example of escape from the world can we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the world, shall we accept that dogma, since the contrary example of great Avataras is there to show that not only by rejecting the life of the world as it is can we help, but also and more by accepting and uplifting it. And if it is a play of the All-Existence, then we may well <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to play out our part in it with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> and courage, well take <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in the game along with our divine Playmate.\n\nBut, most of all, the view we have taken of the world forbids the renunciation of world-existence so long as we can be anything to God and man in their working-out of its purposes. We regard the world not as an invention of the devil or a self-delusion of the soul, but as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of the Divine, although as yet a partial because a progressive and evolutionary manifestation. Therefore for us renunciation of life cannot be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of life nor rejection of the world the object for which the world was created. We seek to realise our unity with God, but for us that realisation involves a complete and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> recognition<span class='page-number' id='s-328' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.328]</span> of our unity with man and we cannot cut the two asunder. To use Christian language, the Son of God is also the Son of Man and both <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> are necessary to the complete Christhood; or to use an Indian form of thought, the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Narayana</span> of whom the universe is only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> ray is revealed and fulfilled in man; the complete man is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nara-Narayana</span> and in that completeness he symbolises the supreme mystery of existence.\n\nTherefore renunciation must be for us merely an instrument and not an object; nor can it be the only or the chief instrument since our object is the fulfilment of the Divine in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>, a positive aim which cannot be reached by negative means. The negative means can only be for the removal of that which stands in the way of the positive fulfilment. It must be a renunciation, a complete renunciation of all that is other than and opposed to the divine self-fulfilment and a progressive renunciation of all that is a lesser or only a partial achievement. We shall have no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to our life in the world; if that attachment exists, we must renounce it and renounce utterly; but neither shall we have any attachment to the escape from the world, to salvation, to the great self-annihilation; if that attachment exists, that also we must renounce and renounce it utterly.\n\nAgain our renunciation must obviously be an inward renunciation; especially and above all, a renunciation of attachment and the craving of desire in the senses and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, of self-will in the thought and action and of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> in the centre of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>. For these things are the three knots by which we are bound to our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> and if we can renounce these utterly, there is nothing else that can bind us. Therefore attachment and desire must be utterly cast out; there is nothing in the world to which we must be attached, not wealth nor poverty, nor joy nor suffering, nor life nor death, nor greatness nor littleness, nor vice nor virtue, nor friend, nor wife, nor children, nor country, nor our work and mission, nor heaven nor earth, nor all that is within them or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> them. And this does not mean that there is nothing at all that we shall love, nothing in which we shall take delight; for attachment is egoism in love and not love<span class='page-number' id='s-329' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.329]</span> itself, desire is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and insecurity in a hunger for pleasure and satisfaction and not the seeking after the divine delight in things. A universal love we must have, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and yet eternally intense beyond the brief vehemence of the most violent passion; a delight in things rooted in a delight in God that does not adhere to their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> but to that which they conceal in themselves and that embraces the universe without being caught in its meshes.[^1]\n\n[^1]: *Nirlipta*. The divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span> in things is *niṣkāma* and *nirlipta*, free from desire and therefore not attached.\n\nSelf-will in thought and action has, we have already seen, to be quite renounced if we would be perfect in the way of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine works</span>; it has equally to be renounced if we are to be perfect in divine knowledge. This self-will means an egoism in the mind which attaches itself to its preferences, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span>, its past or present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> of thought and view and will because it regards them as itself or its own, weaves around them the delicate threads of \"I-ness\" and \"my-ness\" and lives in them like a spider in its web. It hates to be disturbed, as a spider hates attack on its web, and feels foreign and unhappy if transplanted to fresh view-points and formations as a spider feels foreign in another web than its own. This attachment must be entirely excised from the mind. Not only must we give up the ordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> to the world and life to which the unawakened mind clings as its natural element; but we must not remain bound in any mental construction of our own or in any intellectual thought-system or arrangement of religious dogmas or logical conclusions; we must not only cut asunder the snare of the mind and the senses, but flee also beyond the snare of the thinker, the snare of the theologian and the church-builder, the meshes of the Word and the bondage of the Idea. All these are within us waiting to wall in the spirit with forms; but we must always go beyond, always renounce the lesser for the greater, the finite for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>; we must be prepared to proceed from illumination to illumination, from experience to experience, from soul-state to soul-state so as to reach the utmost transcendence of the Divine and its utmost universality. Nor must we attach ourselves even<span class='page-number' id='s-330' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.330]</span> to the truths we hold most securely, for they are but forms and expressions of the Ineffable who refuses to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> himself to any form or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>; always we must keep ourselves open to the higher Word from above that does not confine itself to its own sense and the light of the Thought that carries in it its own opposites.\n\nBut the centre of all resistance is egoism and this we must pursue into every covert and disguise and drag it out and slay it; for its disguises are endless and it will cling to every shred of possible self-concealment. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Altruism</span> and indifference are often its most effective disguises; so draped, it will riot boldly in the very face of the divine spies who are missioned to hunt it out. Here the formula of the supreme knowledge comes to our help; we have nothing to do in our essential standpoint with these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span>, for there is no I nor thou, but only one divine Self equal in all embodiments, equal in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span>, and to realise that, to express that, to serve that, to fulfil that is all that matters. Self-satisfaction and altruism, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> and indifference are not the essential thing. If the realisation, fulfilment, service of the one Self demands from us an action that seems to others self-service or self-assertion in the egoistic sense or seems egoistic enjoyment and self-indulgence, that action we must do; we must be governed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> within rather than by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> of men. The influence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> works often with great subtlety; we prefer and put on almost unconsciously the garb which will look best in the eye that regards us from outside and we allow a veil to drop over the eye within; we are impelled to drape ourselves in the vow of poverty, or in the garb of service, or in outward proofs of indifference and renunciation and a spotless sainthood because that is what tradition and opinion demand of us and so we can make best an impression on our environment. But all this is vanity and delusion. We may be called upon to assume these things, for that may be the uniform of our service; but equally it may not. The eye of man outside matters nothing; the eye within is all.\n\nWe see in the teaching of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> how subtle a thing is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> from egoism which is demanded. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arjuna</span> is driven to<span class='page-number' id='s-331' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.331]</span> fight by the egoism of strength, the egoism of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span>; he is turned from the battle by the contrary egoism of weakness, the shrinking, the spirit of disgust, the false pity that overcomes the mind, the nervous being and the senses,—not that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine compassion</span> which strengthens the arm and clarifies the knowledge. But this weakness comes garbed as renunciation, as virtue: \"Better the life of the beggar than to taste these blood-stained enjoyments; I desire not the rule of all the earth, no, nor the kingdom of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>.\" How foolish of the Teacher, we might say, not to confirm this mood, to lose this sublime <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of adding one more great soul to the army of Sannyasins, one more shining example before the world of a holy renunciation. But the Guide sees otherwise, the Guide who is not to be deceived by words; \"This is weakness and delusion and egoism that speak in thee. Behold the Self, open thy eyes to the knowledge, purify thy soul of egoism.\" And afterwards? \"Fight, conquer, enjoy a wealthy kingdom.\" Or to take another example from ancient Indian tradition. It was egoism, it would seem, that drove Rama, the Avatara, to raise an army and destroy a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to recover his wife from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> of Lanka. But would it have been a lesser egoism to drape himself in indifference and misusing the formal terms of the knowledge to say, \"I have no wife, no enemy, no desire; these are illusions of the senses; let me cultivate the Brahman-knowledge and let Ravana do what he will with the daughter of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Janaka</span>\"?\n\nThe criterion is within, as the Gita insists. It is to have the soul free from craving and attachment, but free from the attachment to inaction as well as from the egoistic impulse to action, free from attachment to the forms of virtue as well as from the attraction to sin. It is to be rid of \"I-ness\" and \"my-ness\" so as to live in the one Self and act in the one Self; to reject the egoism of refusing to work through the individual centre of the universal Being as well as the egoism of serving the individual mind and life and body to the exclusion of others. To live in the Self is not to dwell for oneself alone in the Infinite immersed and oblivious of all things in that ocean of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> self-delight; but it is to live as the Self and in the Self equal in this<span class='page-number' id='s-332' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.332]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> and all embodiments and beyond all embodiments. This is the integral knowledge.\n\nIt will be seen that the scope we give to the idea of renunciation is different from the meaning currently attached to it. Currently its meaning is self-denial, inhibition of pleasure, rejection of the objects of pleasure. Self-denial is a necessary discipline for the soul of man, because his heart is ignorantly attached; inhibition of pleasure is necessary because his sense is caught and clogged in the mud-honey of sensuous satisfactions; rejection of the objects of pleasure is imposed because the mind fixes on the object and will not leave it to go beyond it and within itself. If the mind of man were not thus ignorant, attached, bound even in its restless inconstancy, deluded by the forms of things, renunciation would not have been needed; the soul could have travelled on the path of delight, from the lesser to the greater, from joy to diviner joy. At present that is not practicable. It must give up from within everything to which it is attached in order that it may gain that which they are in their reality. The external renunciation is not the essential, but even that is necessary for a time, indispensable in many things and sometimes useful in all; we may even say that a complete external renunciation is a stage through which the soul must pass at some period of its progress,—though always it should be without those self-willed violences and fierce self-torturings which are an offence to the Divine seated within us. But in the end this renunciation or self-denial is always an instrument and the period for its use passes. The rejection of the object ceases to be necessary when the object can no longer ensnare us because what the soul enjoys is no longer the object as an object but the Divine which it expresses; the inhibition of pleasure is no longer needed when the soul no longer seeks pleasure but possesses the delight of the Divine in all things equally without the need of a personal or physical possession of the thing itself; self-denial loses its field when the soul no longer claims anything, but obeys consciously the will of the one Self in all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>. It is then that we are freed from the Law and released into the liberty of the Spirit.\n\nWe must be prepared to leave behind on the path not only<span class='page-number' id='s-333' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.333]</span> that which we stigmatise as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, but that which seems to us to be good, yet is not the one good. There are things which were beneficial, helpful, which seemed perhaps at one time the one thing desirable, and yet once their work is done, once they are attained, they become obstacles and even hostile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> when we are called to advance beyond them. There are desirable states of the soul which it is dangerous to rest in after they have been mastered, because then we do not march on to the wider kingdoms of God beyond. Even divine realisations must not be clung to, if they are not the divine realisation in its utter essentiality and completeness. We must rest at nothing less than the All, nothing short of the utter transcendence. And if we can thus be free in the spirit, we shall find out all the wonder of God's workings; we shall find that in inwardly renouncing everything we have lost nothing. \"By all this abandoned thou shalt come to enjoy the All.\" For everything is kept for us and restored to us but with a wonderful change and transfiguration into the All-Good and the All-Beautiful, the All-Light and the All-Delight of Him who is for ever pure and infinite and the mystery and the miracle that ceases not through the ages.<span class='page-number' id='s-334' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.334]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/renunciation","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Synthesis of the Disciplines of Knowledge","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-disciplines-of-knowledge","prvt":"Concentration","prvu":"/cwsa/23/concentration","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-synthesis-of-the-disciplines-of-knowledge"],"t":"The Synthesis of the Disciplines of Knowledge","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"In the last chapter we have spoken of renunciation in its most general scope, even as we spoke of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> its possibilities; what has been said, applies therefore equally to the path of Works and the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span> as to the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span>; for on all three concentration and renunciation are needed, though the way and spirit in which they are applied may vary.

Practically, this path is a reascent up the great ladder of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> down which the soul has descended into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>.\n\nThe central aim of Knowledge is the recovery of the Self, of our true self-existence, and this aim presupposes the admission that our present mode of being is not our true self-existence. No doubt, we have rejected the trenchant solutions which cut the knot of the riddle of the universe; we recognise it neither as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> of material appearance created by Force, nor as an unreality set up by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mind</span>, nor as a bundle of sensations, ideas and results of idea and sensation with a great Void or a great blissful Zero behind it to strive towards as our true truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>non-existence</span>. We accept the Self as a reality and the universe as a reality of the Self, a reality of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and not of mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material force</span> and formation, but none the less or rather all the more for that reason a reality. Still, though the universe is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> and not a fiction, a fact of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> and universal and not a fiction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> self, our state of existence here is a state of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span>, not the true truth of our being. We conceive of ourselves falsely, we see ourselves as we are not; we live in a false relation with our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, because we know neither<span class='page-number' id='s-335' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.335]</span> the universe nor ourselves for what they really are but with an imperfect view founded on a temporary fiction which the Soul and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> have established between themselves for the convenience of the evolving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>. And this falsity is the root of a general perversion, confusion and suffering which besiege at every step both our internal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and our relations with our environment. Our personal life and our communal life, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> with ourselves and our commerce with our fellows are founded on a falsity and are therefore false in their recognised principles and methods, although through all this error a growing truth continually seeks to express itself. Hence the supreme importance to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> of Knowledge, not what is called the practical knowledge of life, but of the profoundest knowledge of the Self and Nature[^1] on which alone a true practice of life can be founded.\n\n[^1]: *ātmajñāna* and *tattvajñāna.*\n\nThe error proceeds from a false identification. Nature has created within her material unity separate-seeming bodies which the Soul manifested in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span> enfolds, inhabits, possesses, uses; the Soul forgetting itself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> only this single knot in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> and says \"I am this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>.\" It thinks of itself as the body, suffers with the body, enjoys with the body, is born with the body, is dissolved with the body; or so at least it views its self-existence. Again, Nature has created within her unity of universal life separate-seeming currents of life which form themselves into a whorl of vitality around and in each body, and the Soul manifested in vital Nature seizes on and is seized by that current, is imprisoned momentarily in that little whirling vortex of life. The Soul, still forgetting itself, says \"I am this life\"; it thinks of itself as the life, craves with its cravings or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, wallows in its pleasures, bleeds with its wounds, rushes or stumbles with its movements. If it is still mainly governed by the body-sense, it identifies its own existence with that of the whorl and thinks \"When this whorl is dissipated by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> of the body round which it has formed itself, then I shall be no more.\" If it has been able to sense the current of life which has formed the vortex, it thinks of itself as that<span class='page-number' id='s-336' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.336]</span> current and says \"I am this stream of life; I have entered upon the possession of this body, I shall leave it and enter upon the possession of other bodies: I am an immortal life revolving in a cycle of constant rebirth.\"\n\nBut again Nature has created within her mental unity, formed in the universal Mind separate-seeming dynamos as it were of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> for the generation, distribution and reabsorption of mental force and mental activities, stations as it were in a system of mental telegraphy where messages are conceived, written, sent, received, deciphered, and these messages and these activities are of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> kinds, sensational, emotional, perceptual, conceptual, intuitional, all of which the Soul manifested in mental Nature accepts, uses for its outlook on the world and seems to itself to project and to receive their shocks, to suffer or to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> their consequences. Nature instals the base of these dynamos in the material bodies she has formed, makes these bodies the ground for her stations and connects the mental with the material by a nerve-system full of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of vital currents through which the mind becomes conscious of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span> and, so far as it chooses, of the vital world of Nature. Otherwise the mind would be conscious of the mental world first and chiefly and would only indirectly glimpse the material. As it is, its attention is fixed on the body and the material world in which it has been installed and it is aware of the rest of existence only dimly, indirectly or subconsciously in that vast remainder of itself with regard to which superficially it has become irresponsive and oblivious.\n\nThe Soul identifies itself with this mental dynamo or station and says \"I am this mind.\" And since the mind is absorbed in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bodily life</span>, it thinks \"I am a mind in a living body\" or, still more commonly, \"I am a body which lives and thinks.\" It identifies itself with the thoughts, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, sensations of the embodied mind and imagines that because when the body is dissolved all this will dissolve, itself also will cease to exist. Or if it becomes conscious of the current of persistence of mental personality, it thinks of itself as a mental soul occupying the body whether<span class='page-number' id='s-337' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.337]</span> once or repeatedly and returning from earthly living to mental worlds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>; the persistence of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> mentally enjoying or suffering sometimes in the body, sometimes on the mental or vital plane of Nature it calls its immortal existence. Or else, because the mind is a principle of light and knowledge, however imperfect, and can have some notion of what is beyond it, it sees the possibility of a dissolution of the mental being into that which is beyond, some Void or some eternal Existence, and it says, \"There I, the mental soul, cease to be.\" Such dissolution it dreads or desires, denies or affirms according to its measure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to or repulsion from this present play of embodied mind and vitality.\n\nNow, all this is a mixture of truth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span>. Mind, Life, Matter exist and mental, vital, physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individualisation</span> exists as facts in Nature, but the identification of the soul with these things is a false identification. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mind, Life and Matter</span> are ourselves only in this sense that they are principles of being which the true self has evolved by the meeting and interaction of Soul and Nature in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to express a form of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> existence as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cosmos</span>. Individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> are a play of these principles which is set up in the commerce of Soul and Nature as a means for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> of itself of which the one Existence is eternally capable and which it holds eternally involved in its unity. Individual mind, life and body are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of ourselves in so far as we are centres of the multiplicity of the One; universal Mind, Life and Body are also forms of our self, because we are that One in our being. But the self is more than universal or individual mind, life and body and when we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> ourselves by identification with these things, we found our knowledge on a falsehood, we falsify our determining view and our practical experience not only of our self-being but of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> existence and of our individual activities.\n\nThe Self is an eternal utter Being and pure existence of which all these things are becomings. From this knowledge we have to proceed; this knowledge we have to realise and make it the foundation of the inner and the outer life of the individual. The Yoga of Knowledge, starting from this primary truth, has conceived<span class='page-number' id='s-338' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.338]</span> a negative and positive method of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> by which we shall get rid of these false identifications and recoil back from them into true self-knowledge. The negative method is to say always \"I am not the body\" so as to contradict and root out the false idea \"I am the body\", to concentrate on this knowledge and by renunciation of the attachment of the soul to the physical get rid of the body-sense. We say again \"I am not the life\" and by concentration on this knowledge and renunciation of attachment to the vital movements and desires, get rid of the life-sense. We say, finally, \"I am not the mind, the motion, the sense, the thought\" and by concentration on this knowledge and renunciation of the mental activities, get rid of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind-sense</span>. When we thus constantly create a gulf between ourselves and the things with which we identified ourselves, their veils progressively fall away from us and the Self begins to be visible to our experience. Of that then we say \"I am That, the pure, the eternal, the self-blissful\" and by concentrating our thought and being upon it we become That and are able finally to renounce the individual existence and the Cosmos. Another positive method belonging rather to the Rajayoga is to concentrate on the thought of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> and shut out from us all other ideas, so that this dynamo of mind shall cease to work upon our external or varied internal existence; by mental cessation the vital and physical play also shall fall to rest in an eternal samadhi, some inexpressible deepest trance of the being in which we shall pass into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> Existence.\n\nThis discipline is evidently a self-centred and exclusive inner movement which gets rid of the world by denying it in thought and shutting the eyes of the soul to it in vision. But the universe is there as a truth in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> even though the individual soul may have shut its eyes to it and the Self is there in the universe really and not falsely, supporting all that we have rejected, truly immanent in all things, really embracing the individual in the universal as well as embracing the universe in that which exceeds and transcends it. What shall we do with this eternal Self in this persistent universe which we see encompassing us every time we come out of the trance of inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span>? The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> Path of Knowledge has its solution and its discipline for the soul that<span class='page-number' id='s-339' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.339]</span> looks out on the universe. It is to regard the immanent and all-encompassing and all-constituting Self in the image of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> in which all forms are, which is in all forms, of which all forms are made. In that ether <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Life</span> and Mind move as the Breath of things, an atmospheric sea in the ethereal, and constitute from it all these forms; but what they constitute are merely <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span> and not realities; the form of the pot we see is a form of earth only and goes back into the earth, earth a form resolvable into the cosmic Life, the cosmic Life a movement that falls to rest in that silent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> Ether. Concentrating on this knowledge, rejecting all phenomenon and appearance, we come to see the whole as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of name and form in the ether that is Brahman; it becomes unreal to us; and the universe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> unreal the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immanence</span> becomes unreal and there is only the Self upon which our mind has falsely imposed the name and form of the universe. Thus are we justified in the withdrawal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span> into the Absolute.\n\nStill, the Self goes on with its imperishable aspect of immanence, its immutable aspect of divine envelopment, its endless trick of becoming each thing and all things; our detection of the cheat and our withdrawal do not seem to affect one tittle either the Self or the universe. Must we not then know also what it is that thus persists superior to our acceptance and rejection and too great, too eternal to be affected by it? Here too there must be some invincible reality at work and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span> of Knowledge demands that we shall see and realise it; otherwise it may prove that our own knowledge and not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> in the universe was the cheat and the illusion. Therefore we must concentrate again and see and realise also this which persists so sovereignly and must know the Self as no other than the Supreme Soul which is the Lord of Nature, the upholder of cosmic existence by whose sanction it proceeds, whose will compels its multitudinous actions and determines its perpetual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cycles</span>. And we must yet concentrate once again and see and realise and must know the Self as the one Existence who is both the Soul of all and the Nature of all, at once Purusha and Prakriti and so able both to express himself in all these forms of things and to be all these<span class='page-number' id='s-340' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.340]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span>. Otherwise we have excluded what the Self does not exclude and made a wilful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> in our knowledge.\n\nThe old ascetic Path of Knowledge admitted the unity of things and the concentration on all these aspects of the one Existence, but it made a distinction and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hierarchy</span>. The Self that becomes all these forms of things is the Virat or universal Soul; the Self that creates all these forms is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hiranyagarbha</span>, the luminous or creatively perceptive Soul; the Self that contains all these things involved in it is Prajna, the conscious Cause or originally determining Soul; beyond all these is the Absolute who permits all this unreality, but has no dealings with it. Into That we must withdraw and have no farther dealings with the universe, since Knowledge means the final Knowledge, and therefore these lesser realisations must fall away from us or be lost in That. But evidently from our point of view these are practical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> made by the mind which have a value for certain purposes, but no ultimate value. Our view of the world insists on unity; the universal Self is not different from the perceptive and creative, nor the perceptive from the causal, nor the causal from the Absolute, but it is one \"Self-being which has become all becomings\", and which is not any other than the Lord who manifests Himself as all these individual existences nor the Lord any other than the sole-existing Brahman who verily is all this that we can see, sense, live or mentalise. That Self, Lord, Brahman we would know that we may realise our unity with it and with all that it manifests and in that unity we would live. For we demand of knowledge that it shall unite; the knowledge that divides must always be a partial knowing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> for certain practical purposes; the knowledge that unites is *the* knowledge.\n\nTherefore our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> will take up these various disciplines and concentrations, but harmonise and if possible fuse them by a synthesis which removes their mutual exclusions. Not realising the Lord and the All only to reject them for silent Self or unknowable Absolute as would an exclusively transcendental, nor living for the Lord alone or in the All alone as would an exclusively theistic or an exclusively pantheistic Yoga, the seeker<span class='page-number' id='s-341' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.341]</span> of integral knowledge will limit himself neither in his thought nor in his practice nor in his realisation by any religious creed or philosophical dogma. He will seek the Truth of existence in its completeness. The ancient disciplines he will not reject, for they rest upon eternal truths, but he will give them an orientation in conformity with his aim.\n\nWe must recognise that our primary aim in knowledge must be to realise our own supreme Self more than that Self in others or as the Lord of Nature or as the All; for that is the pressing need of the individual, to arrive at the highest truth of his own being, to set right its disorders, confusions, false identifications, to arrive at its right concentration and purity and to know and mount to its source. But we do this not in order to disappear into its source, but so that our whole existence and all the members of this inner kingdom may find their right basis, may live in our highest self, live for our highest self only and obey no other law than that which proceeds from our highest self and is given to our purified being without any falsification in the transmitting mentality. And if we do this rightly we shall discover that in finding this supreme Self we have found the one Self in all, the one Lord of our nature and of all Nature, the All of ourselves who is the All of the universe. For this that we see in ourselves we must necessarily see everywhere, since that is the truth of His unity. By discovering and using rightly the Truth of our being the barrier between our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> and the universe will necessarily be forced open and cast away and the Truth that we realise in our own being cannot fail to realise itself to us in the universality which will then be our self. Realising in ourselves the \"I am He\" of the Vedanta, we cannot but realise in looking upon all around us the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> knowledge on its other side, \"Thou <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> That.\" We have only to see how practically the discipline must be conducted in order that we may arrive successfully at this great unification.<span class='page-number' id='s-342' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.342]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-disciplines-of-knowledge","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Release from Subjection to the Body","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-subjection-to-the-body","prvt":"Renunciation","prvu":"/cwsa/23/renunciation","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-release-from-subjection-to-the-body"],"t":"The Release from Subjection to the Body","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Our first step in this path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, having once determined in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> that what seems is not the Truth, that the self is not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, since these are only its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, must be to set right our mind in its practical relation with the life and the body so that it may arrive at its own right relation with the Self. This it is easiest to do by a device with which we are already familiar, since it played a great part in our view of the Yoga of Works; it is to create a separation between the Prakriti and the Purusha. The Purusha, the soul that knows and commands has got himself involved in the workings of his executive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span></span>, so that he mistakes this physical working of it which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the body for himself; he forgets his own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> as the soul that knows and commands; he believes his mind and soul to be subject to the law and working of the body; he forgets that he is so much else besides that is greater than the physical form; he forgets that the mind is really greater than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> and ought not to submit to its obscurations, reactions, habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>, habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span>; he forgets that he is more even than the mind, a Power which can raise the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> above itself; that he is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span>, the Transcendent and it is not fit the Master should be enslaved to his own workings, the Transcendent imprisoned in a form which exists only as a trifle in its own being. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> this forgetfulness has to be cured by the Purusha remembering his own true nature and first by his remembering that the body is only a working and only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> working of Prakriti.\n\nWe say then to the mind \"This is a working of Prakriti, this is neither thyself nor myself; stand back from it.\" We shall find, if we try, that the mind has this power of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span> and<span class='page-number' id='s-343' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.343]</span> can stand back from the body not only in idea, but in act and as it were physically or rather vitally. This detachment of the mind must be strengthened by a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of indifference to the things of the body; we must not care essentially about its sleep or its waking, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> or its rest, its pain or its pleasure, its health or ill-health, its vigour or its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span>, its comfort or its discomfort, or what it eats or drinks. This does not mean that we shall not keep the body in right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> so far as we can; we have not to fall into violent asceticisms or a positive neglect of the physical frame. But we have not either to be affected in mind by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span> or thirst or discomfort or ill-health or attach the importance which the physical and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> attaches to the things of the body, or indeed any but a quite subordinate and purely instrumental importance. Nor must this instrumental importance be allowed to assume the proportions of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>; we must not for instance imagine that the purity of the mind depends on the things we eat or drink, although during a certain stage restrictions in eating and drinking are useful to our inner progress; nor on the other hand must we continue to think that the dependence of the mind or even of the life on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> and drink is anything more than a habit, a customary relation which Nature has set up between these principles. As a matter of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> the food we take can be reduced by contrary habit and new relation to a minimum without the mental or vital vigour being in any way reduced; even on the contrary with a judicious development they can be trained to a greater potentiality of vigour by learning to rely on the secret fountains of mental and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> with which they are connected more than upon the minor aid of physical aliments. This aspect of self-discipline is however more important in the Yoga of self-perfection than here; for our present purpose the important point is the renunciation by the mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> to or dependence on the things of the body.\n\nThus disciplined the mind will gradually learn to take up towards the body the true attitude of the Purusha. First of all, it will know the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental Purusha</span> as the upholder of the body and not in any way the body itself; for it is quite other than<span class='page-number' id='s-344' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.344]</span> the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> which it upholds by the mind through the agency of the vital force. This will come to be so much the normal attitude of the whole being to the physical frame that the latter will feel to us as if something external and detachable like the dress we wear or an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> we happen to be carrying in our hand. We may even come to feel that the body is in a certain sense non-existent except as a sort of partial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of our vital force and of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. These <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> are signs that the mind is coming to a right poise regarding the body, that it is exchanging the false view-point of the mentality obsessed and captured by physical sensation for the view-point of the true truth of things.\n\nSecondly, with regard to the movements and experiences of the body the mind will come to know the Purusha seated within it as, first, the witness or observer of the movements and, secondly, the knower or perceiver of the experiences. It will cease to consider in thought or feel in sensation these movements and experiences as its own but rather consider and feel them as not its own, as operations of Nature governed by the qualities of Nature and their interaction upon each other. This detachment can be made so normal and carried so far that there will be a kind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> between the mind and the body and the former will observe and experience the hunger, thirst, pain, fatigue, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span>, etc. of the physical being as if they were experiences of some other person with whom it has so close a *rapport* as to be aware of all that is going on within him. This division is a great means, a great step towards mastery; for the mind comes to observe these things first without being overpowered and finally without being at all affected by them, dispassionately, with clear understanding but with perfect detachment. This is the initial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> from servitude to the body; for by right knowledge put steadily into practice liberation comes inevitably.\n\nFinally, the mind will come to know the Purusha in the mind as the master of Nature whose sanction is necessary to her movements. It will find that as the giver of the sanction he can withdraw the original fiat from the previous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of<span class='page-number' id='s-345' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.345]</span> Nature and that eventually the habit will cease or change in the direction indicated by the will of the Purusha; not at once, for the old sanction persists as an obstinate consequence of the past Karma of Nature until that is exhausted, and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> deal also depends on the force of the habit and the idea of fundamental necessity which the mind had previously attached to it; but if it is not one of the fundamental habits Nature has established for the relation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> and if the old sanction is not renewed by the mind or the habit willingly indulged, then eventually the change will come. Even the habit of hunger and thirst can be minimised, inhibited, put away; the habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> can be similarly minimised and gradually eliminated and in the meantime the power of the mind to set right the disorders of the body whether by conscious manipulation of vital force or by simple mental fiat will immensely increase. By a similar process the habit by which the bodily nature associates certain forms and degrees of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> with strain, fatigue, incapacity can be rectified and the power, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, swiftness, effectiveness of the work whether physical or mental which can be done with this bodily instrument marvellously increased, doubled, tripled, decupled.\n\nThis side of the method belongs properly to the Yoga of self-perfection; but it is as well to speak briefly of these things here both because we thereby lay a basis for what we shall have to say of self-perfection, which is a part of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>, and because we have to correct the false notions popularised by materialistic Science. According to this Science the normal mental and physical states and the relations between mind and body actually established by our past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> are the right, natural and healthy conditions and anything other, anything opposite to them is either morbid and wrong or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hallucination</span>, self-deception and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>insanity</span>. Needless to say, this conservative principle is entirely ignored by Science itself when it so diligently and successfully improves on the normal operations of physical Nature for the greater mastery of Nature by man. Suffice it to say here once for all that a change of mental and physical state and of relations between the mind and body which increases the<span class='page-number' id='s-346' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.346]</span> purity and freedom of the being, brings a clear <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and peace and multiplies the power of the mind over itself and over the physical functions, brings about in a word man's greater mastery of his own nature, is obviously not morbid and cannot be considered a hallucination or self-deception since its effects are patent and positive. In fact, it is simply a willed advance of Nature in her evolution of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>, an evolution which she will carry out in any case but in which she chooses to utilise the human will as her chief agent, because her essential aim is to lead the Purusha to conscious mastery over herself.\n\nThis being said, we must add that in the movement of the path of knowledge perfection of the mind and body are no consideration at all or only secondary considerations. The one thing necessary is to rise out of Nature to the Self by either the most swift or the most thorough and effective method possible; and the method we are describing, though not the swiftest, is the most thorough-going in its effectivity. And here there arises the question of physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> or inaction. It is ordinarily considered that the Yogin should draw away from action as much as possible and especially that too much action is a hindrance because it draws off the energies outward. To a certain extent this is true; and we must note farther that when the mental Purusha takes up the attitude of mere witness and observer, a tendency to silence, solitude, physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and bodily inaction grows upon the being. So long as this is not associated with inertia, incapacity or unwillingness to act, in a word, with the growth of the tamasic quality, all this is to the good. The power to do nothing, which is quite different from indolence, incapacity or aversion to action and attachment to inaction, is a great power and a great mastery; the power to rest absolutely from action is as necessary for the Jnanayogin as the power to cease absolutely from thought, as the power to remain indefinitely in sheer solitude and silence and as the power of immovable calm. Whoever is not willing to embrace these states is not yet fit for the path that leads towards the highest knowledge; whoever is unable to draw towards them, is as yet unfit for its acquisition.\n\nAt the same time it must be added that the power is enough;<span class='page-number' id='s-347' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.347]</span> the abstention from all physical action is not indispensable, the aversion to action mental or corporeal is not desirable. The seeker of the integral state of knowledge must be free from attachment to action and equally free from attachment to inaction. Especially must any tendency to mere inertia of mind or vitality or body be surmounted, and if that habit is found growing on the nature, the will of the Purusha must be used to dismiss it. Eventually, a state arrives when the life and the body perform as mere instruments the will of the Purusha in the mind without any strain or attachment, without their putting themselves into the action with that inferior, eager and often feverish energy which is the nature of their ordinary working; they come to work as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of Nature work without the fret and toil and reaction characteristic of life in the body when it is not yet master of the physical. When we attain to this perfection, then action and inaction become immaterial, since neither interferes with the freedom of the soul or draws it away from its urge towards the Self or its poise in the Self. But this state of perfection arrives later in the Yoga and till then the law of moderation laid down by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> is the best for us; too much mental or physical action then is not good since excess draws away too much energy and reacts unfavourably upon the spiritual condition; too little also is not good since defect leads to a habit of inaction and even to an incapacity which has afterwards to be surmounted with difficulty. Still, periods of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> calm, solitude and cessation from works are highly desirable and should be secured as often as possible for that recession of the soul into itself which is indispensable to knowledge.\n\nWhile dealing thus with the body we have necessarily to deal also with the Prana or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-energy</span>. For practical purposes we have to make a distinction between the life-energy as it acts in the body, the physical Prana, and the life-energy as it acts in support of the mental activities, the psychical Prana. For we lead always a double life, mental and physical, and the same life-energy acts differently and assumes a different aspect according as it lends itself to one or the other. In the body it produces those reactions of hunger, thirst, fatigue, health, disease, physical<span class='page-number' id='s-348' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.348]</span> vigour, etc. which are the vital experiences of the physical frame. For the gross body of man is not like the stone or the earth; it is a combination of two sheaths, the vital and the \"food\" sheath and its life is a constant interaction of these two. Still the life-energy and the physical frame are two different things and in the withdrawal of the mind from the absorbing sense of the body we become increasingly sensible of the Prana and its action in the corporeal instrument and can observe and more and more control its operations. Practically, in drawing back from the body we draw back from the physical life-energy also, even while we distinguish the two and feel the latter nearer to us than the mere physical instrument. The entire conquest of the body comes in fact by the conquest of the physical life-energy.\n\nAlong with the attachment to the body and its works the attachment to life in the body is overcome. For when we feel the physical being to be not ourselves, but only a dress or an instrument, the repulsion to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of the body which is so strong and vehement an instinct of the vital man must necessarily weaken and can be thrown away. Thrown away it must be and entirely. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of death and the aversion to bodily cessation are the stigma left by his animal origin on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>. That brand must be utterly effaced.<span class='page-number' id='s-349' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.349]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-subjection-to-the-body","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Release from the Heart and the Mind","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-the-heart-and-the-mind","prvt":"The Synthesis of the Disciplines of Knowledge","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-synthesis-of-the-disciplines-of-knowledge","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-release-from-the-heart-and-the-mind"],"t":"The Release from the Heart and the Mind","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"But the ascending soul has to separate itself not only from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> but from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-energy</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>; it has to make the mind say as the representative of the Purusha \"I am not the Life; the Life is not the self of the Purusha, it is only a working and only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> working of Prakriti.\" The characteristics of Life are action and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, a reaching out to absorb and assimilate what is external to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> and a principle of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in what it seizes upon or what comes to it, which is associated with the all-pervading phenomenon of attraction and repulsion.

Therefore the psychic life-energy presents itself to our experience as a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-mind</span>, which we have to conquer if we mean to get back to our true self.\n\nDesire is at once the motive of our actions, our lever of<span class='page-number' id='s-350' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.350]</span> accomplishment and the bane of our existence. If our sense-mind, emotional mind, thought-mind could act free from the intrusions and importations of the life-energy, if that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> could be made to obey their right action instead of imposing its own yoke on our existence, all human problems would move harmoniously to their right solution. The proper function of the life-energy is to do what it is bidden by the divine principle in us, to reach to and enjoy what is given to it by that indwelling Divine and not to desire at all. The proper function of the sense-mind is to lie open passively, luminously to the contacts of Life and transmit their sensations and the *rasa* or right taste and principle of delight in them to the higher function; but interfered with by the attractions and repulsions, the acceptances and refusals, the satisfactions and dissatisfactions, the capacities and incapacities of the life-energy in the body it is, to begin with, limited in its scope and, secondly, forced in these limits to associate itself with all these discords of the life in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span>. It becomes an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for pleasure and pain instead of for delight of existence.\n\nSimilarly the emotional mind compelled to take note of all these discords and subject itself to their emotional reactions becomes a hurtling field of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, wrath, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>, struggle, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, disgust, likes, dislikes, indifferences, content, discontent, hopes, disappointments, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gratitude</span>, revenge and all the stupendous play of passion which is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> of life in the world. This chaos we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> our soul. But the real soul, the real psychic entity which for the most part we see little of and only a small minority in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> has developed, is an instrument of pure love, joy and the luminous reaching out to fusion and unity with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and our fellow-creatures. This psychic entity is covered up by the play of the mentalised Prana or desire-mind which we mistake for the soul; the emotional mind is unable to mirror the real soul in us, the Divine in our hearts, and is obliged instead to mirror the desire-mind.\n\nSo too the proper function of the thought-mind is to observe, understand, judge with a dispassionate delight in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and open itself to messages and illuminations playing upon all that it observes and upon all that is yet hidden from it but must<span class='page-number' id='s-351' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.351]</span> progressively be revealed, messages and illuminations that secretly flash down to us from the divine Oracle concealed in light above our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> whether they seem to descend through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> or arise from the seeing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>. But this it cannot do rightly because it is pinned to the limitations of the life-energy in the senses, to the discords of sensation and emotion, and to its own limitations of intellectual preference, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>, straining, self-will which are the form taken in it by the interference of this desire-mind, this psychic Prana. As is said in the Upanishads, our whole mind-consciousness is shot through with the threads and currents of this Prana, this Life-energy that strives and limits, grasps and misses, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and suffers, and only by its purification can we know and possess our real and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> self.\n\nIt is true that the root of all this evil is the ego-sense and that the seat of the conscious ego-sense is the mind itself; but in reality the conscious mind only reflects an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> already created in the subconscious mind in things, the dumb soul in the stone and the plant which is present in all body and life and only finally delivered into voicefulness and wakefulness but not originally created by the conscious mind. And in this upward procession it is the life-energy which has become the obstinate knot of the ego, it is the desire-mind which refuses to relax the knot even when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and the heart have discovered the cause of their ills and would be glad enough to remove it; for the Prana in them is the Animal who revolts and who obscures and deceives their knowledge and coerces their will by his refusal.\n\nTherefore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental Purusha</span> has to separate himself from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> and self-identification with this desire-mind. He has to say \"I am not this thing that struggles and suffers, grieves and rejoices, loves and hates, hopes and is baffled, is angry and afraid and cheerful and depressed, a thing of vital moods and emotional passions. All these are merely workings and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of Prakriti in the sensational and emotional mind.\" The mind then draws back from its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and becomes with these, as with the bodily movements and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>, the observer or witness. There is again an inner cleavage. There is this emotional mind in which these moods and passions continue to occur according to<span class='page-number' id='s-352' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.352]</span> the habit of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of Nature</span> and there is the observing mind which sees them, studies and understands but is detached from them. It observes them as if in a sort of action and play on a mental stage of personages other than itself, at first with interest and a habit of relapse into identification, then with entire <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span>, and, finally, attaining not only to calm but to the pure delight of its own silent existence, with a smile at their unreality as at the imaginary joys and sorrows of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> who is playing and loses himself in the play. Secondly, it becomes aware of itself as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the sanction who by his withdrawal of sanction can make this play to cease. When the sanction is withdrawn, another significant phenomenon takes place; the emotional mind becomes normally calm and pure and free from these reactions, and even when they come, they no longer rise from within but seem to fall on it as impressions from outside to which its fibres are still able to respond; but this habit of response dies away and the emotional mind is in time entirely liberated from the passions which it has renounced. Hope and fear, joy and grief, liking and disliking, attraction and repulsion, content and discontent, gladness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>depression</span>, horror and wrath and fear and disgust and shame and the passions of love and hatred fall away from the liberated psychic being.\n\nWhat takes their place? It may be, if we will, an entire calm, silence and indifference. But although this is a stage through which the soul has usually to pass, it is not the final aim we have placed before us. Therefore the Purusha becomes also the master who wills and whose will it is to replace wrong by right <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of the psychic existence. What he wills, Nature executes. What was fabric-stuff of desire and passion, is turned into reality of pure, equal and calmly intense love and joy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. The real soul emerges and takes the place left vacant by the desire-mind. The cleansed and emptied cup is filled with the wine of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> and delight and no longer with the sweet and bitter poison of passion. The passions, even the passion for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, misrepresent the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>. The passion of pity with its impure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of physical repulsion and emotional inability to bear the suffering of others has to be rejected and replaced by<span class='page-number' id='s-353' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.353]</span> the higher divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> which sees, understands, accepts the burden of others and is strong to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> and heal, not with self-will and revolt against the suffering in the world and with ignorant accusation of the law of things and their source, but with light and knowledge and as an instrument of the Divine in its emergence. So too the love that desires and grasps and is troubled with joy and shaken with grief must be rejected for the equal, all-embracing love that is free from these things and has no dependence upon circumstances and is not modified by response or absence of response. So we shall deal with all the movements of the soul; but of these things we shall speak farther when we consider the Yoga of self-perfection.\n\nAs with action and inaction, so it is with this dual possibility of indifference and calm on the one side and active joy and love on the other. Equality, not indifference is the basis. Equal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span>, impartial indifference, calm submission to the causes of joy and grief without any reaction of either grief or joy are the preparation and negative basis of equality; but equality is not fulfilled till it takes its positive form of love and delight. The sense-mind must find the equal *rasa* of the All-Beautiful, the heart the equal love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span> for all, the psychic Prana the enjoyment of this *rasa*, love and Ananda. This, however, is the positive perfection that comes by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>; our first object on the path of knowledge is rather the liberation that comes by detachment from the desire-mind and by the renunciation of its passions.\n\nThe desire-mind must also be rejected from the instrument of thought and this is best done by the detachment of the Purusha from thought and opinion itself. Of this we have already had occasion to speak when we considered in what consists the integral purification of the being. For all this movement of knowledge which we are describing is a method of purification and liberation whereby entire and final self-knowledge becomes possible, a progressive self-knowledge being itself the instrument of the purification and liberation. The method with the thought-mind will be the same as with all the rest of the being. The Purusha, having used the thought-mind for release<span class='page-number' id='s-354' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.354]</span> from identification with the life and body and with the mind of desire and sensations and emotions, will turn round upon the thought-mind itself and will say \"This too I am not; I am not the thought or the thinker; all these ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>, speculations, strivings of the intellect, its predilections, preferences, dogmas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span>, self-corrections are not myself; all this is only a working of Prakriti which takes place in the thought-mind.\" Thus a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> is created between the mind that thinks and wills and the mind that observes and the Purusha becomes the witness only; he sees, he understands the process and laws of his thought, but detaches himself from it. Then as the master of the sanction he withdraws his past sanction from the tangle of the mental undercurrent and the reasoning intellect and causes both to cease from their importunities. He becomes liberated from subjection to the thinking mind and capable of the utter silence.\n\nFor perfection there is necessary also the resumption by the Purusha of his position as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of his Nature and the will to replace the mere mental undercurrent and intellect by the truth-conscious thought that lightens from above. But the silence is necessary; in the silence and not in the thought we shall find the Self, we shall become aware of it, not merely conceive it, and we shall withdraw out of the mental Purusha into that which is the source of the mind. But for this withdrawal a final liberation is needed, the release from the ego-sense in the mind.<span class='page-number' id='s-355' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.355]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-the-heart-and-the-mind","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Release from the Ego","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-the-ego","prvt":"The Release from Subjection to the Body","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-release-from-subjection-to-the-body","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-release-from-the-ego"],"t":"The Release from the Ego","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The formation of a mental and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> tied to the body-sense was the first great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life</span> in its progressive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>; for this was the means it found for creating out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> a conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>.

This double <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is usually represented as a fall and a redemption or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span>,—the kindling of a light and its extinction or the formation first of a smaller temporary and unreal self and a release from it into our true self's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> largeness. For human thought falls apart towards two opposite extremes: one, mundane and pragmatic, regards the fulfilment and satisfaction of the mental, vital and physical ego-sense individual or collective as the object of life and looks no farther, while the other, spiritual, philosophic or religious, regards the conquest of the ego in the interests of the soul, spirit or whatever be the ultimate entity, as the one thing supremely worth doing. Even in the camp of the ego there are two divergent attitudes which divide the mundane or materialist theory of the universe. One tendency of this thought regards the mental ego as a creation of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> which will be dissolved with the dissolution of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>; the one abiding truth is eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> working in the race—this or another—and her purpose should be followed, not ours,—the fulfilment of the race, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective ego</span>, and not that of the individual should be the rule of life. Another trend of thought, more vitalistic in its tendencies, fixes on the conscious ego as the supreme achievement of Nature, no matter how transitory, ennobles it into a human representative of the Will-to-be and holds up its greatness and satisfaction as the highest aim of our<span class='page-number' id='s-356' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.356]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. In the more numerous systems that take their stand on some kind of religious thought or spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> there is a corresponding divergence. The Buddhist denies the existence of a real self or ego, admits no universal or transcendent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Being</span>. The Adwaitin declares the apparently individual soul to be none other than the supreme Self and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span>, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>; the putting off of individual existence is the only true release. Other systems assert, in flat contradiction of this view, the eternal persistence of the human soul; a basis of multiple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> in the One or else a dependent but still separate entity, it is constant, real, imperishable.\n\nAmidst these various and conflicting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> the seeker of the Truth has to decide for himself which shall be for him the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span>. But if our aim is a spiritual release or a spiritual fulfilment, then the exceeding of this little mould of ego is imperative. In human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> and its satisfaction there can be no divine culmination and deliverance. A certain purification from egoism is the condition even of ethical progress and elevation, for social <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and perfection; much more is it indispensable for inner peace, purity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>. But a much more radical deliverance, not only from egoism but from ego-idea and ego-sense, is needed if our aim is to raise human into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>. Experience shows that, in proportion as we deliver ourselves from the limiting mental and vital ego, we command a wider life, a larger existence, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span>, a happier soul-state, even a greater knowledge, power and scope. Even the aim which the most mundane philosophy pursues, the fulfilment, perfection, satisfaction of the individual, is best assured not by satisfying the narrow ego but by finding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> in a higher and larger self. There is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> in smallness of the being, says the Scripture, it is with the large being that happiness comes. The ego is by its nature a smallness of being; it brings contraction of the consciousness and with the contraction <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> of knowledge, disabling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span>,—confinement and a diminution of power and by that diminution <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> and weakness,—scission of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> and by that scission <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disharmony</span> and failure of sympathy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and understanding,—inhibition or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fragmentation</span> of<span class='page-number' id='s-357' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.357]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of being and by that fragmentation pain and sorrow. To recover what is lost we must break out of the walls of ego. The ego must either disappear in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span> or fuse into a larger I: it must fuse into the wider cosmic \"I\" which comprehends <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> these smaller selves or the transcendent of which even the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic self</span> is a diminished image.\n\nBut this cosmic self is spiritual in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> and in experience; it must not be confused with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective existence</span>, with any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> soul or the life and body of a human society or even of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>. The subordination of the ego to the progress and happiness of the human race is now a governing idea in the world's thought and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span>; but this is a mental and moral and not a spiritual ideal. For that progress is a series of constant mental, vital and physical vicissitudes, it has no firm spiritual content, and offers no sure standing-ground to the soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>. The consciousness of collective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> is only a larger comprehensive edition or a sum of individual egos. Made of the same substance, in the same mould of nature, it has not in it any greater light, any more eternal sense of itself, any purer source of peace, joy and deliverance. It is rather even more tortured, troubled and obscured, certainly more vague, confused and unprogressive. The individual is in this respect greater than the mass and cannot be called on to subordinate his more luminous possibilities to this darker entity. If light, peace, deliverance, a better state of existence are to come, they must descend into the soul from something wider than the individual, but also from something higher than the collective ego. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Altruism</span>, philanthropy, the service of mankind are in themselves mental or moral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, not laws of the spiritual life. If into the spiritual aim there enters the impulse to deny the personal self or to serve humanity or the world at large, it comes not from the ego nor from the collective sense of the race, but from something more occult and profound transcendent of both these things; for it is founded on a sense of the Divine in all and it works not for the sake of the ego or the race but for the sake of the Divine and its purpose in the person or group or collective. It is this transcendent Source which we must seek and serve, this vaster<span class='page-number' id='s-358' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.358]</span> being and consciousness to which the race and the individual are minor terms of its existence.\n\nThere is indeed a truth behind the pragmatic impulse which an exclusive one-sided spirituality is apt to ignore or deny or belittle. It is this that since the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual and the universal</span> are terms of that higher and vaster Being, their fulfilment must have some real place in the supreme Existence. There must be behind them some high purpose in the supreme Wisdom and Knowledge, some eternal strain in the supreme Delight: they cannot have been, they were not created in vain. But the perfection and satisfaction of humanity like the perfection and satisfaction of the individual, can only be securely compassed and founded upon a more eternal yet unseized truth and right of things. Minor terms of some greater Existence, they can fulfil themselves only when that of which they are the terms is known and possessed. The greatest service to humanity, the surest foundation for its true progress, happiness and perfection is to prepare or find the way by which the individual and the collective man can transcend the ego and live in its true self, no longer bound to ignorance, incapacity, disharmony and sorrow. It is by the pursuit of the eternal and not by living bound in the slow collective evolution of Nature that we can best assure even that evolutionary, collective, altruistic aim our modern thought and idealism have set before us. But it is in itself a secondary aim; to find, know and possess the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine existence</span>, consciousness and nature and to live in it for the Divine is our true aim and the one perfection to which we must aspire.\n\nIt is then in the way of the spiritual philosophies and religions, not in that of any earth-bound materialistic doctrine, that the seeker of the highest knowledge has to walk, even if with enriched <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> and a more comprehensive spiritual purpose. But how far has he to proceed in the elimination of the ego? In the ancient way of knowledge we arrive at the elimination of the ego-sense which attaches itself to the body, to the life, to the mind and says of all or any of them, \"This is I\". Not only do we, as in the way of works, get rid of the \"I\" of the worker and see the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> alone as the true source of all works and sanction<span class='page-number' id='s-359' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.359]</span> of works and His executive Nature-power or else His supreme Shakti as the sole agent and worker,—but we get rid also of the ego-sense which mistakes the instruments or the expressions of our being for our true self and spirit. But even if all this has been done, something remains still; there remains a substratum of all these, a general sense of the separate I. This substratum ego is something vague, indefinable, elusive; it does not or need not attach itself to anything in particular as the self; it does not identify itself with anything collective; it is a sort of fundamental form or power of the mind which compels the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> to feel himself as a perhaps indefinable but still a limited being which is not mind, life or body, but under which their activities proceed in Nature. The others were a qualified ego-idea and ego-sense supporting themselves on the play of the Prakriti; but this is the pure fundamental ego-power supporting itself on the consciousness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental Purusha</span>. And because it seems to be above or behind the play and not in it, because it does not say \"I am the mind, life or body,\" but \"I am a being on whom the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> depends,\" <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> think themselves released and mistake this elusive Ego for the One, the Divine, the true Purusha or at the very least for the true Person within them,—mistaking the indefinable for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>. But so long as this fundamental ego-sense remains, there is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> release. The egoistic life, even if diminished in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and intensity, can still continue well enough with this support. If there is the error in identification, the ego life may under that pretext get rather an exaggerated intensity and force. Even if there is no such error, the ego life may be wider, purer, more flexible and release may be now much easier to attain and nearer to accomplishment, but still there is as yet no definitive release. It is imperative to go farther, to get rid of this indefinable but fundamental ego-sense also and get back to the Purusha on whom it is supporting itself, of whom it is a shadow; the shadow has to disappear and by its disappearance reveal the spirit's unclouded substance.\n\nThat substance is the self of the man called in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Monad</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian philosophy</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jivatman</span>, the living entity, the self of the living creature. This Jiva is not the<span class='page-number' id='s-360' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.360]</span> mental ego-sense constructed by the workings of Nature for her temporary purpose. It is not a thing bound, as the mental being, the vital, the physical are bound, by her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span>, laws or processes. The Jiva is a spirit and self, superior to Nature. It is true that it consents to her acts, reflects her moods and upholds the triple medium of mind, life and body through which she casts them upon the soul's consciousness; but it is itself a living reflection or a soul-form or a self-creation of the Spirit universal and transcendent. The One Spirit who has mirrored some of His modes of being in the world and in the soul, is multiple in the Jiva. That Spirit is the very Self of our self, the One and the Highest, the Supreme we have to realise, the infinite existence into which we have to enter. And so far the teachers walk in company, all agreeing that this is the supreme object of knowledge, of works and of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span>, all agreeing that if it is to be attained, the Jiva must release himself from the ego-sense which belongs to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower Nature</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. But here they part company and each goes his own way. The Monist fixes his feet on the path of an exclusive Knowledge and sets for us as sole ideal an entire return, loss, immersion or extinction of the Jiva in the Supreme. The Dualist or the partial Monist turns to the path of Devotion and directs us to shed indeed the lower ego and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> life</span>, but to see as the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of the spirit of man, not the self-annihilation of the Buddhist, not the self-immersion of the Adwaitin, not a swallowing up of the many by the One, but an eternal existence absorbed in the thought, love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of the Supreme, the One, the All-Lover.\n\nFor the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disciple</span> of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> there can be no hesitation; as a seeker of knowledge it is the integral knowledge and not anything either half-way and attractive or high-pinnacled and exclusive he must seek. He must soar to the utmost height, but also circle and spread to the most all-embracing wideness, not binding himself to any rigid structure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphysical thought</span>, but free to admit and combine all the soul's highest and greatest and fullest and most numerous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>. If the highest height of spiritual experience, the sheer summit of all realisation is the absolute union of the soul with the Transcendent<span class='page-number' id='s-361' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.361]</span> who exceeds the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual and the universe</span>, the widest scope of that union is the discovery of that very Transcendent as the source, support, continent, informing and constituent spirit and substance of both these manifesting powers of the divine Essence and the divine Nature. Whatever the path, this must be for him the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>. The Yoga of Action also is not fulfilled, is not absolute, is not victoriously complete until the seeker has felt and lives in his essential and integral oneness with the Supreme. One he must be with the Divine both in his highest and inmost and in his widest being and consciousness, in his work, his will, his power of action, his mind, body, life. Otherwise he is only released from the illusion of individual works, but not released from the illusion of separate being and instrumentality. As the servant and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the Divine he works, but the crown of his labour and its perfect base or motive is oneness with that which he serves and fulfils. The Yoga of devotion too is complete only when the lover and the Beloved are unified and difference is abolished in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of a divine oneness; and yet in the mystery of this unification there is the sole existence of the Beloved but no extinction or absorption of the lover. It is the highest unity which is the express direction of the path of knowledge, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> to absolute oneness is its impulse, the experience of it its magnet, but it is this very highest unity which takes as its field of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> in him the largest possible cosmic wideness. Obeying the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> to withdraw successively from the practical egoism of our triple nature and its fundamental ego-sense, we come to the realisation of the spirit, the self, lord of this individual human manifestation, but our knowledge is not integral if we do not make this self in the individual one with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic spirit</span> and find their greater reality above in an inexpressible but not unknowable Transcendence. The Jiva, possessed of himself, must give himself up into the being of the Divine. The self of the man must be made one with the Self of all; the self of the finite individual must pour itself into the boundless finite and that cosmic spirit too must be exceeded in the transcendent Infinite.\n\nThis cannot be done without an uncompromising abolition<span class='page-number' id='s-362' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.362]</span> of the ego-sense at its very basis and source. In the path of Knowledge one attempts this abolition, negatively by a denial of the reality of the ego, positively by a constant fixing of the thought upon the idea of the One and the Infinite in itself or the One and Infinite everywhere. This, if persistently done, changes in the end the mental outlook on oneself and the whole world and there is a kind of mental realisation; but afterwards by degrees or perhaps rapidly and imperatively and almost at the beginning the mental realisation deepens into spiritual experience—a realisation in the very substance of our being. More and more frequent conditions come of something indefinable and illimitable, a peace, a silence, a joy, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, a sense of absolute <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> Power, a pure existence, a pure consciousness, an all-pervading Presence. The ego persists in itself or in its habitual movements, but the place of the one becomes more and more loosened, the others are broken, crushed, more and more rejected, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> weak in their intensity, limp or mechanical in their action. In the end there is a constant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> up of the whole consciousness into the being of the Supreme. In the beginning when the restless confusion and obscuring impurity of our outward nature is active, when the mental, vital, physical ego-sense are still powerful, this new mental outlook, these experiences may be found difficult in the extreme: but once that triple egoism is discouraged or moribund and the instruments of the Spirit are set right and purified, in an entirely pure, silent, clarified, widened consciousness the purity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span>, stillness of the One reflects itself like the sky in a limpid lake. A meeting or a taking in of the reflected Consciousness by that which reflects it becomes more and more pressing and possible; the bridging or abolition of the atmospheric gulf between that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> ethereal impersonal vastness and this once mobile whirl or narrow stream of personal existence is no longer an arduous improbability and may be even a frequent experience, if not yet an entirely permanent state. For even before complete purification, if the strings of the egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and mind are already sufficiently frayed and loosened, the Jiva can by a sudden snapping of the main cords escape, ascending like a<span class='page-number' id='s-363' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.363]</span> bird freed into the spaces or widening like a liberated flood into the One and Infinite. There is first a sudden sense of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic consciousness</span>, a casting of oneself into the universal; from that universality one can aspire more easily to the Transcendent. There is a pushing back and rending or a rushing down of the walls that imprisoned our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>; there is a loss of all sense of individuality and personality, of all placement in Space or Time or action and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of Nature</span>; there is no longer an ego, a person definite and definable, but only consciousness, only existence, only peace or bliss; one becomes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>, becomes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span>, becomes infinity. All that is left of the personal soul is a hymn of peace and freedom and bliss vibrating somewhere in the Eternal.\n\nWhen there is an insufficient purity in the mental being, the release appears at first to be partial and temporary; the Jiva seems to descend again into the egoistic life and the higher consciousness to be withdrawn from him. In reality, what happens is that a cloud or veil intervenes between the lower nature and the higher consciousness and the Prakriti resumes for a time its old habit of working under the pressure but not always with a knowledge or present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of that high experience. What works in it then is a ghost of the old ego supporting a mechanical repetition of the old habits upon the remnants of confusion and impurity still left in the system. The cloud intervenes and disappears, the rhythm of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> and descent renews itself until the impurity has been worked out. This period of alternations may easily be long in the integral Yoga; for there an entire perfection of the system is required; it must be capable at all times and in all conditions and all circumstances, whether of action or inaction, of admitting and then living in the consciousness of the supreme Truth. Nor is it enough for the sadhaka to have the utter realisation only in the trance of Samadhi or in a motionless quietude, but he must in trance or in waking, in passive reflection or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of action be able to remain in the constant Samadhi of the firmly founded Brahmic consciousness.[^1] But if<span class='page-number' id='s-364' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.364]</span> or when our conscious being has become sufficiently pure and clear, then there is a firm station in the higher consciousness. The impersonalised Jiva, one with the universal or possessed by the Transcendent, lives high-seated above[^2] and looks down undisturbed at whatever remnants of the old working of Nature may revisit the system. He cannot be moved by the workings of the three modes of Prakriti in his lower being, nor can he be shaken from his station by the attacks even of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and suffering. And finally, there being no veil between, the higher peace overpowers the lower disturbance and mobility. There is a settled silence in which the soul can take sovereign possession of itself above and below and altogether.\n\n[^1]: <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>.\n\n[^2]: *Udāsīna*, the word for the spiritual \"indifference\", that is to say the unattached freedom of the soul touched by the supreme knowledge.\n\nSuch possession is not indeed the aim of the traditional Yoga of knowledge whose object is rather to get away from the above and the below and the all into the indefinable Absolute. But whatever the aim, the path of knowledge must lead to one first result, an absolute quietude; for unless the old action of Nature in us be entirely quieted, it is difficult if not impossible to found either any true soul-status or any divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. Our nature acts on a basis of confusion and restless compulsion to action, the Divine acts freely out of a fathomless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>. Into that abyss of tranquillity we must plunge and become that, if we are to annul the hold of this lower nature upon the soul. Therefore the universalised Jiva first ascends into the Silence; it becomes vast, tranquil, actionless. What action takes place, whether of body and these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> or any working whatever, the Jiva sees but does not take part in, authorise or in any way associate itself with it. There is action, but no personal actor, no bondage, no responsibility. If personal action is needed, then the Jiva has to keep or recover what has been called the form of the ego, a sort of mental image of an \"I\" that is the knower, devotee, servant or instrument, but an image only and not a reality. If even that is not there, still action can continue by the mere continued force of Prakriti, without any personal actor, without indeed there<span class='page-number' id='s-365' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.365]</span> being any sense of an actor at all; for the Self into which the Jiva has cast its being is the actionless, the fathomlessly still. The path of works leads to the realisation of the Lord, but here even the Lord is not known; there is only the silent Self and Prakriti doing her works, even, as it seems at first, not with truly living entities but with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> existing in the Self but which the Self does not admit as real. The soul may go even beyond this realisation; it may either rise to the Brahman on the other side of all idea of Self as a Void of everything that is here, a Void of unnameable peace and extinction of all, even of the Sat, even of that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Existent</span> which is the impersonal basis of individual or universal personality; or else it may unite with it as an ineffable \"That\" of which nothing can be said; for the universe and all that is does not even exist in That, but appears to the mind as a dream more unsubstantial than any dream ever seen or imagined, so that even the word dream seems too positive a thing to express its entire unreality. These experiences are the foundation of that lofty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Illusionism</span> which takes such firm hold of the human mind in its highest overleapings of itself.\n\nThese ideas of dream and illusion are simply results in our still existent mentality of the new poise of the Jiva and its denial of the claim made upon it by its old mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> and view of life and existence. In reality, the Prakriti does not act for itself or by its own motion, but with the Self as lord; for out of that Silence wells all this action, that apparent Void looses out as if into movement all these infinite riches of experience. To this realisation the sadhaka of the integral Yoga must arrive by the process that we shall hereafter describe. What then, when he so resumes his hold upon the universe and views no longer himself in the world but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span> in himself, will be the position of the Jiva or what will fill in his new consciousness the part of the ego-sense? There will be no ego-sense even if there is a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individualisation</span> for the purposes of the play of universal consciousness in an individual mind and frame; and for this reason that all will be unforgettably the One and every Person or Purusha will be to him the One in many forms or rather in many aspects and poises, Brahman acting upon Brahman, one<span class='page-number' id='s-366' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.366]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nara-Narayana</span>[^3] everywhere. In that larger play of the Divine the joy of the relations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> also is possible without the lapse into the ego-sense,—just as the supreme state of human love likewise is described as the unity of one soul in two bodies. The ego-sense is not indispensable to the world-play in which it is so active and so falsifies the truth of things; the truth is always the One at work on itself, at play with itself, infinite in unity, infinite in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span>. When the individualised consciousness rises to and lives in that truth of the cosmic play, then even in full action, even in possession of the lower being the Jiva remains still one with the Lord, and there is no bondage and no delusion.

We have to know ourselves as the self, the spirit, the eternal; we have to exist consciously in our true being. Therefore this must be our primary, if not our first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> and all-absorbing idea and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> in the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>. But when we have realised the eternal self that we are, when we have become that inalienably, we have still a secondary aim, to establish the true relation between this eternal self that we are and the mutable existence and mutable world which till now we had falsely taken for our real being and our sole possible status.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that there should be any real relation, it must be a relation between two realities. Formerly we had thought the eternal self to be a remote concept far from our mundane existence if not an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> and an unreality, because in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of things we could not conceive of ourselves as anything except this mind, life, body, changing and moving in the succession of Time. When we have once got rid of our confinement to this lower status, we are apt to seize on the other side of the same erroneous relation between self and world; we tend to regard this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span> which we increasingly are or in which we live as the sole reality and begin to look down from it upon the world and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> as a remote illusion and unreality, because that is a status quite opposite to our new foundation in which we no longer place our roots of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>, from which we have been lifted up and transfigured and with which we seem to have no longer any binding link. Especially is this likely to happen if we have made the finding of the eternal Self not only our primary, but our<span class='page-number' id='s-368' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.368]</span> one and absorbing objective in the withdrawal from the lower triplicity; for then we are likely to shoot at once from pure mind to pure spirit without treading the stairs between this middle and that summit and we tend to fix on our consciousness the profound sense of a gulf which we cannot bridge and can no longer cross over again except by a painful fall.\n\nBut the self and the world are in an eternal close relation and there is a connection between them, not a gulf that has to be overleaped. Spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> existence are highest and lowest rung of an orderly and progressive series. Therefore between the two there must be a real relation and principle of connection by which the eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> is able to be at once pure Spirit and Self and yet hold in himself the universe of himself; and it must be possible for the soul that is one with or in union with the Eternal to adopt the same poise of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> relation in place of our present ignorant immersion in the world. This principle of connection is the eternal unity between the Self and all existences; of that eternal unity the liberated soul must be capable, just as the ever free and unbound Divine is capable of it, and that we should realise equally with the pure self-existence at which we have first to aim. For integral self-possession we must be one not only with the Self, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, but with all existences. We must take back in the right relation and in the poise of an eternal Truth the world of our manifested existence peopled by our fellow-beings from which we had drawn back because we were bound to them in a wrong relation and in the poise of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> created in Time by the principle of divided consciousness with all its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oppositions</span>, discords and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span>. We have to take back all things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> into our new consciousness but as one with all, not divided from them by an egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>.\n\nIn other words, besides the consciousness of the transcendent Self pure, self-existent, timeless, spaceless we have to accept and become the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> consciousness, we have to identify our being with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span> who makes himself the base and continent of the worlds and dwells in all existences. This is the realisation which the ancient Vedantins spoke of as seeing all existences in the self and the self in all existences; and in addition they speak<span class='page-number' id='s-369' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.369]</span> of the crowning realisation of the man in whom the original miracle of existence has been repeated, self-being has become all these existences that belong to the worlds of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>.[^1] In these three terms is expressed, fundamentally, the whole of that real relation between the self and the world which we have to substitute for the false relation created by the limiting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>. This is the new vision and sense of infinite being which we have to acquire, this the foundation of that unity with all which we have to establish.\n\n[^1]: <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Isha</span> Upanishad.\n\nFor our real self is not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>, that is only a figure, an appearance; our real self is cosmic, infinite, it is one with all existence and the inhabitant of all existences. The self behind our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> is the same as the self behind the mind, life and body of all our fellow-beings, and if we come to possess it, we shall naturally, when we turn to look out again upon them, tend to become one with them in the common basis of our consciousness. It is true that the mind opposes any such identification and if we allow it to persist in its old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> and activities, it will rather strive to bring again its veil of dissonances over our new realisation and possession of self than to shape and subject itself to this true and eternal vision of things. But in the first place, if we have proceeded rightly on the path of our Yoga, we shall have attained to Self through a purified mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, and a purified mind is one that is necessarily passive and open to the knowledge. Secondly, even the mind in spite of its tendency to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> and divide can be taught to think in the rhythm of the unifying Truth instead of the broken terms of the limiting appearance. We must therefore accustom it by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> to cease to think of things and beings as separately <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existent</span> in themselves and rather to think always of the One everywhere and of all things as the One. Although we have spoken hitherto of the withdrawing motion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span> as the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of knowledge and as if it were to be pursued alone and by itself, yet in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> it is better for the sadhaka of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> to unite the two movements. By<span class='page-number' id='s-370' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.370]</span> one he will find the self within, by the other he will find that self in all that seems to us at present to be outside us. It is possible indeed to begin with the latter <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, to realise all things in this visible and sensible existence as God or Brahman or Virat Purusha and then to go <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> to all that is behind the Virat. But this has its inconveniences and it is better, if that be found possible, to combine the two movements.\n\nThis realisation of all things as God or Brahman has, as we have seen, three aspects of which we can conveniently make three successive stages of experience. First, there is the Self in whom all beings exist. The Spirit, the Divine has manifested itself as infinite self-extended being, self-existent, pure, not subject to Time and Space, but supporting Time and Space as figures of its consciousness. It is more than all things and contains them all within that self-extended being and consciousness, not bound by anything that it creates, holds or becomes, but free and infinite and all-blissful. It holds them, in the old image, as the infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> contains in itself all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>. This image of the ethereal (<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Akasha</span>) Brahman may indeed be of great practical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to the sadhaka who finds a difficulty in meditating on what seems to him at first an abstract and unseizable idea. In the image of the ether, not physical but an encompassing ether of vast being, consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, he may seek to see with the mind and to feel in his mental being this supreme existence and to identify it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> with the self within him. By such meditation the mind may be brought to a favourable state of predisposition in which, by the rending or withdrawing of the veil, the supramental vision may flood the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> and change entirely all our seeing. And upon that change of seeing, as it becomes more and more potent and insistent and occupies all our consciousness, there will supervene eventually a change of becoming so that what we see we become. We shall be in our self-consciousness not so much cosmic as ultra-cosmic, infinite. Mind and life and body will then be only movements in that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> which we have become, and we shall see that what exists is not world at all but simply this infinity of spirit in which move the mighty cosmic harmonies of its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> of self-conscious becoming.<span class='page-number' id='s-371' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.371]</span>\n\nBut what then of all these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and existences that make up the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span>? Shall they be to us only images, empty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span> without any informing reality, poor worthless things in themselves and however grandiose, puissant or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> they once seemed to our mental vision, now to be rejected and held of no value? Not so; although that would be the first natural result of a very intense absorption in the infinity of the all-containing Self to the exclusion of the infinities that it contains. But these things are not empty, not mere unreal name and form imagined by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Mind</span>; they are, as we have said, in their reality self-conscious becomings of the Self, that is to say, the Self dwells within all of them even as within us, conscious of them, governing their motion, blissful in his habitation as in his embrace of all that he becomes. As the ether both contains and is as it were contained in the jar, so this Self both contains and inhabits all existences, not in a physical but in a spiritual sense, and is their reality. This indwelling State of the Self we have to realise; we have to see and ourselves to become in our consciousness the Self in all existences. We have, putting aside all vain resistance of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span>, to know that the Divine inhabits all these becomings and is their true Self and conscious Spirit, and not to know it only intellectually but to know by a self-experience that shall compel into its own diviner mould all the habits of the mental consciousness.\n\nThis Self that we are has finally to become to our self-consciousness entirely one with all existences in spite of its exceeding them. We have to see it not only as that which contains and inhabits all, but that which is all, not only as indwelling spirit, but also as the name and form, the movement and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the movement, the mind and life and body. It is by this final realisation that we shall resume entirely in the right poise and the vision of the Truth all that we drew back from in the first movement of recoil and withdrawal. The individual mind, life and body which we recoiled from as not our true being, we shall recover as a true becoming of the Self, but no longer in a purely individual narrowness. We shall take up the mind not as a separate mentality imprisoned in a petty motion, but<span class='page-number' id='s-372' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.372]</span> as a large movement of the universal mind, the life not as an egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of vitality and sensation and desire, but as a free movement of the universal life, the body not as a physical prison of the soul but as a subordinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> and detachable robe, realising that also as a movement of universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span>, a cell of the cosmic Body. We shall come to feel all the consciousness of the physical world as one with our physical consciousness, feel all the energies of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic life</span> around as our own energies, feel all the heart-beats of the great cosmic impulse and seeking in our heart-beats set to the rhythm of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, feel all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the universal mind flowing into our mentality and our thought-action flowing out upon it as a wave into that wide sea.

We have seen this already in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of realising the Self as at once one and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span>; for we have to realise each thing and being as That; we have to realise the unity of all as That, both in the unity of sum and in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> of essence; and we have to realise That as the Transcendent who is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> all this unity and this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> which we see everywhere as the two opposite, yet companion poles of all existence. For every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> being is the Self, the Divine in spite of the outward limitations of the mental and physical form through which it presents itself at the actual moment, in the actual field of space, in the actual succession of circumstances that make up the web of inner state and outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and event through which we know the individual. So, equally, every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collectivity</span> small or great is each the Self, the Divine similarly expressing itself in the conditions of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>. We cannot really know any individual or any collectivity if we know it only as it appears inwardly to itself or outwardly to us, but only if we know it as the Divine, the One, our own Self employing its various essential modes and its occasional circumstances of self-manifestation. Until we have transformed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> so that it shall live entirely in this knowledge reconciling all differences in the One, we do not live in the real Truth, because we do not live in the real Unity. The accomplished sense of Unity is not that in which all are regarded as parts of one whole, waves of one sea, but that in which each as well as the All is regarded wholly as the Divine, wholly as our Self in a supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>.\n\nAnd yet, so complex is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>, there is a sense in which the view of all as parts of the whole, waves of the sea or even as in a sense separate entities becomes a<span class='page-number' id='s-375' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.375]</span> necessary part of the integral Truth and the integral Knowledge. For if the Self is always one in all, yet we see that for the purposes at least of the cyclic manifestation it expresses itself in perpetual soul-forms which preside over the movements of our personality through the worlds and the aeons. This persistent soul-existence is the real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Individuality</span> which stands behind the constant mutations of the thing we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> our personality. It is not a limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> but a thing in itself infinite; it is in truth the Infinite itself consenting from one plane of its being to reflect itself in a perpetual soul-experience. This is the truth which underlies the Sankhya theory of many Purushas, many essential, infinite, free and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> souls reflecting the movements of a single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>. It stands also, in a different way, behind the very different philosophy of qualified Monism which arose as a protest against the metaphysical excesses of Buddhistic Nihilism and illusionist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Adwaita</span>. The old semi-Buddhistic, semi-Sankhya theory which saw only the Quiescent and nothing else in the world except a constant combination of the five <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> and the three modes of inconscient Energy lighting up their false <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of the Quiescent in which it is reflected, is not the whole truth of the Brahman. We are not a mere mass of changing mind-stuff, life-stuff, body-stuff taking different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> to birth, so that at no time is there any real self or conscious reason of existence behind all the flux or none except that Quiescent who cares for none of these things. There is a real and stable power of our being behind the constant mutation of our mental, vital and physical personality, and this we have to know and preserve in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that the Infinite may manifest Himself through it according to His will in whatever range and for whatever purpose of His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> cosmic activity.\n\nAnd if we regard existence from the standpoint of the possible eternal and infinite relations of this One from whom all things proceed, these Many of whom the One is the essence and the origin and this Energy, Power, or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> through which the relations of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One and the Many</span> are maintained, we shall see a certain justification even for the dualist philosophies and<span class='page-number' id='s-376' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.376]</span> religions which seem to deny most energetically the unity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> and to make an unbridgeable differentiation between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> and His creatures. If in their grosser forms these religions aim only at the ignorant joys of the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span>, yet there is a far higher and profounder sense in which we may appreciate the cry of the devotee poet when in a homely and vigorous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphor</span> he claimed the right of the soul to enjoy for ever the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of its embrace of the Supreme. \"I do not want to become sugar,\" he wrote, \"I want to eat sugar.\" However strongly we may found ourselves on the essential identity of the one Self in all, we need not regard that cry as the mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of a certain kind of spiritual sensuousness or the rejection by an attached and ignorant soul of the pure and high austerity of the supreme Truth. On the contrary, it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> in its positive part at a deep and mysterious truth of Being which no human language can utter, of which human reason can give no adequate account, to which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> has the key and which no pride of the soul of knowledge insisting on its own pure austerity can abolish. But that belongs properly to the summit of the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Devotion</span> and there we shall have again to return to it.\n\nThe sadhaka of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> will take an integral view of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> and seek its integral realisation. The Divine has many essential modes of His eternal self-manifestation, possesses and finds Himself on many planes and through many poles of His being; to each mode its purpose, to each plane or pole its fulfilment both in the apex and the supreme scope of the eternal Unity. It is necessarily through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual Self</span> that we must arrive at the One, for that is the basis of all our experience. By Knowledge we arrive at identity with the One; for there is, in spite of the Dualist, an essential identity by which we can plunge into our Source and free ourselves from all bondage to individuality and even from all bondage to universality. Nor is the experience of that identity a gain for knowledge only or for the pure state of abstract being. The height of all our action also, we have seen, is the immersion of ourselves in the Lord through unity with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> or Conscious-Power by the way of works; the height of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> is the rapturous immersion of ourselves in unity<span class='page-number' id='s-377' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.377]</span> of ecstatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> with the object of our love and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span>. But again for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine works</span> in the world the individual Self converts itself into a centre of consciousness through which the divine Will, one with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Love</span> and Light, pours itself out in the multiplicity of the universe. We arrive in the same way at our unity with all our fellow-beings through the identity of this self with the Supreme and with the self in all others. At the same time in the action of Nature we preserve by it as soul-form of the One a differentiation which enables us to preserve relations of difference in Oneness with other beings and with the Supreme Himself. The relations will necessarily be very different in essence and spirit from those which we had when we lived entirely in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span> and Oneness was a mere name or a struggling aspiration of imperfect love, sympathy or yearning. Unity will be the law, difference will be simply for the various <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of that unity. Neither descending again into that plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> which clings to the separation of the ego-sense nor attached to an exclusive seeking for pure identity which cannot have to do with any play of difference, we shall embrace and reconcile the two poles of being where they meet in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> of the Highest.\n\nThe Self, even the individual self, is different from our personality as it is different from our mental ego-sense. Our personality is never the same; it is a constant mutation and various combination. It is not a basic consciousness, but a development of forms of consciousness,—not a power of being, but a various play of partial powers of being,—not the enjoyer of the self-delight of our existence, but a seeking after various notes and tones of experience which shall more or less render that delight in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mutability</span> of relations. This also is Purusha and Brahman, but it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mutable Purusha</span>, the phenomenon of the Eternal, not its stable reality. The Gita makes a distinction between three Purushas who constitute the whole state and action of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Being</span>, the Mutable, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Immutable</span> and the Highest which is beyond and embraces the other two. That Highest is the Lord in whom we have to live, the supreme Self in us and in all. The Immutable is the silent, actionless, equal, unchanging self which<span class='page-number' id='s-378' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.378]</span> we reach when we draw back from activity to passivity, from the play of consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and the seeking of delight to the pure and constant basis of consciousness and force and delight through which the Highest, free, secure and unattached, possesses and enjoys the play. The Mutable is the substance and immediate motive of that changing flux of personality through which the relations of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic life</span> are made possible. The mental being fixed in the Mutable moves in its flux and has not possession of an eternal peace and power and self-delight; the soul fixed in the Immutable holds all these in itself but cannot act in the world; but the soul that can live in the Highest enjoys the eternal peace and power and delight and wideness of being, is not bound in its self-knowledge and self-power by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and personality or by forms of its force and habits of its consciousness and yet uses them all with a large <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and power for the self-expression of the Divine in the world. Here again the change is not any alteration of the essential <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of the Self</span>, but consists in our emergence into the freedom of the Highest and the right use of the divine law of our being.\n\nConnected with this triple mode of the Self is that distinction which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian philosophy</span> has drawn between the Qualitied and the Qualitiless Brahman and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> has made between the Personal and the Impersonal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>. The Upanishad indicates clearly enough the relative nature of this opposition, when it speaks of the Supreme as the \"Qualitied who is without qualities\".[^3] We have again two essential modes, two fundamental aspects, two poles of eternal being, both of them exceeded in the transcendent divine Reality. They correspond practically to the Silent and the Active Brahman. For the whole action of the universe may be regarded from a certain point of view as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> and shaping out in various ways of the numberless and infinite qualities of the Brahman. His being assumes by conscious Will all kinds of properties, shapings of the stuff of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span>, habits as it were of cosmic character and power of dynamic self-consciousness, *guṇas*, into which all the<span class='page-number' id='s-379' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.379]</span> cosmic action can be resolved. But by none of these nor by all of them nor by their utmost infinite potentiality is He bound; He is above all His qualities and on a certain plane of being rests free from them. The Nirguna or Unqualitied is not incapable of qualities, rather it is this very Nirguna or No-Quality who manifests Himself as Saguna, as Ananta-guna, infinite quality, since He contains all in His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of boundlessly varied self-revelation. He is free from them in the sense of exceeding them; and indeed if He were not free from them they could not be infinite; God would be subject to His qualities, bound by His nature, Prakriti would be supreme and Purusha its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> and plaything. The Eternal is bound neither by quality nor absence of quality, neither by Personality nor by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Impersonality</span>; He is Himself, beyond all our positive and all our negative definitions.\n\n[^3]: *nirguṇo guṇī.*\n\nBut if we cannot define the Eternal, we can unify ourselves with it. It has been said that we can become the Impersonal, but not the personal God, but this is only true in the sense that no one can become individually the Lord of all the universes; we can free ourselves into the existence of the active Brahman as well as that of the Silence; we can live in both, go back to our being in both, but each in its proper way, by becoming one with the Nirguna in our essence and one with the Saguna in the liberty of our active being, in our nature.[^4] The Supreme pours Himself out of an eternal peace, poise and silence into an eternal activity, free and infinite, freely fixing for itself its self-determinations, using infinite quality to shape out of it varied combination of quality. We have to go back to that peace, poise and silence and act out of it with the divine freedom from the bondage of qualities but still using qualities even the most opposite largely and flexibly for the divine work in the world. Only, while the Lord acts out of the centre of all things, we have to act by transmission of His will and power and self-knowledge through the individual centre, the soul-form of Him which we are. The Lord is subject to nothing; the individual soul-form is subject to its own highest<span class='page-number' id='s-380' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.380]</span> Self and the greater and more absolute is that subjection, the greater becomes its sense of absolute force and freedom.\n\n[^4]: *sādharmya-mukti.*\n\nThe distinction between the Personal and the Impersonal is substantially the same as the Indian distinction, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> words carry within them a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> which is foreign to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian thought</span>. The personal God of the European religions is a Person in the human sense of the word, limited by His qualities though otherwise possessed of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>omnipotence</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>omniscience</span>; it answers to the Indian special conceptions of Shiva or Vishnu or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahma</span> or of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Mother</span> of all, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Durga</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kali</span>. Each religion really erects a different personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Deity</span> according to its own heart and thought to adore and serve. The fierce and inexorable God of Calvin is a different being from the sweet and loving God of St. Francis, as the gracious Vishnu is different from the terrible though always loving and beneficent Kali who has pity even in her slaying and saves by her destructions. Shiva, the God of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> renunciation who destroys all things seems to be a different being from Vishnu and Brahma, who act by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span>, love, preservation of the creature or for life and creation. It is obvious that such conceptions can be only in a very partial and relative sense true descriptions of the infinite and omnipresent Creator and Ruler of the universe. Nor does Indian religious thought affirm them as adequate descriptions. The Personal God is not limited by His qualities, He is Ananta-guna, capable of infinite qualities and beyond them and lord of them to use them as He will, and He manifests Himself in various <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> and forms of His infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> to satisfy the desire and need of the individual soul according to its own nature and personality. It is for this reason that the normal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European mind</span> finds it so difficult to understand <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian religion</span> as distinct from Vedantic or Sankhya philosophy, because it cannot easily conceive of a personal God with infinite qualities, a personal God who is not a Person, but the sole real Person and the source of all personality. Yet that is the only valid and complete truth of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Personality</span>.\n\nThe place of the divine Personality in our synthesis will best be considered when we come to speak of the Yoga of devotion;<span class='page-number' id='s-381' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.381]</span> it is enough here to indicate that it has its place and keeps it in the integral Yoga even when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> has been attained. There are practically three grades of the approach to the personal Deity; the first in which He is conceived with a particular form or particular qualities as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span> of the Godhead which our nature and personality prefers;[^5] a second in which He is the one real Person, the All-Personality, the Ananta-guna; a third in which we get back to the ultimate source of all idea and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of personality in that which the Upanishad indicates by the single word He without fixing any attributes. It is there that our realisations of the personal and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal Divine</span> meet and become one in the utter Godhead. For the impersonal Divine is not ultimately an abstraction or a mere principle or a mere state or power and degree of being any more than we ourselves are really such abstractions. The intellect first approaches it through such conceptions, but realisation ends by exceeding them. Through the realisation of higher and higher principles of being and states of conscious existence we arrive not at the annullation of all in a sort of positive zero or even an inexpressible state of existence, but at the transcendent Existence itself which is also the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Existent</span> who transcends all definition by personality and yet is always that which is the essence of personality.\n\n[^5]: *iṣṭa-devatā.*\n\nWhen in That we live and have our being, we can possess it in both its modes, the Impersonal in a supreme state of being and consciousness, in an infinite impersonality of self-possessing power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, the Personal by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span> acting through the individual soul-form and by the relation between that and its transcendent and universal Self. We may keep even our relation with the personal Deity in His forms and names; if, for instance, our work is predominantly a work of Love it is as the Lord of Love that we can seek to serve and express Him, but we shall have at the same time an integral realisation of Him in all His names and forms and qualities and not mistake the front of Him which is prominent in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> to the world for all the infinite Godhead.<span class='page-number' id='s-382' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.382]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-modes-of-the-self","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Realisation of Sachchidananda","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-realisation-of-sachchidananda","prvt":"The Realisation of the Cosmic Self","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-realisation-of-the-cosmic-self","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-realisation-of-sachchidananda"],"t":"The Realisation of Sachchidananda","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>modes of the Self</span> which we have dealt with in our last Chapter may seem at first to be of a highly metaphysical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, to be intellectual conceptions more fit for philosophical analysis than for practical realisation.

And since it is always the highest he can know or be capable of that must be the aim of the thinking man, it is the highest truth which the soul must seek out by thought and by life accomplish.\n\nHere lies the whole importance of the part of the Yoga of Knowledge which we are now considering, the knowledge[^1] of those essential principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Being</span>, those essential modes of self-existence on which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> has based its self-manifestation. If the truth of our being is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> unity in which alone there is perfect wideness, light, knowledge, power, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, and if all our subjection to darkness, ignorance, weakness, sorrow, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> comes of our viewing existence as a clash of infinitely multiple separate existences, then obviously it is the<span class='page-number' id='s-383' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.383]</span> most practical and concrete and utilitarian as well as the most lofty and philosophical wisdom to find a means by which we can get away from the error and learn to live in the truth. So also, if that One is in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> from bondage to this play of qualities which constitute our psychology and if from subjection to that play are born the struggle and discord in which we live, floundering eternally between the two poles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>, virtue and sin, satisfaction and failure, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, pleasure and pain, then to get <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the qualities and take our foundation in the settled peace of that which is always beyond them is the only practical wisdom.

And it is the ancient highest experience of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> that only by arriving there, only by making oneself impersonal, one, still, self-gathered, superior to the mental and vital existence in that which is eternally superior to it, can a settled, because self-existent peace and internal freedom be acquired. Therefore this is the first, in a sense the characteristic and essential object of the Yoga of Knowledge. But, as we have insisted, this, if first, is not all; if the essential, it is not the complete object. Knowledge is not complete if it merely shows us how to get away from relations to that which is beyond relations, from personality to impersonality, from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> to featureless unity. It must give us also that key, that secret of the whole play of relations, the whole variation of multiplicity, the whole clash and interaction of personalities for which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> existence is seeking. And knowledge is still incomplete if it gives<span class='page-number' id='s-384' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.384]</span> us only an idea and cannot verify it in experience; we seek the key, the secret in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that we may govern the phenomenon by the reality it represents, heal its discords by the hidden principle of concord and unification behind them and arrive from the converging and diverging effort of the world to the harmony of its fulfilment. Not merely peace, but fulfilment is what the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the world is seeking and what a perfect and effective self-knowledge must give to it; peace can only be the eternal support, the infinite condition, the natural atmosphere of self-fulfilment.\n\nMoreover, the knowledge that finds the true secret of multiplicity, personality, quality, play of relations, must show us some real oneness in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of being and intimate unity in power of being between the impersonal and the source of personality, the qualitiless and that which expresses itself in qualities, the unity of existence and its many-featured multiplicity. The knowledge that leaves a yawning gulf between the two, can be no ultimate knowledge, however logical it may seem to the analytical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> or however satisfactory to a self-dividing experience. True knowledge must arrive at a oneness which embraces even though it exceeds the totality of things, not at a oneness which is incapable of it and rejects it. For there can be no such original unbridgeable chasm of duality either in the All-existence itself or between any transcendent Oneness and the All-existent. And as in knowledge, so in experience and self-fulfilment. The experience which finds at the summit of things such an original unbridgeable chasm between two contrary principles and can at most succeed in overleaping it so that it has to live in one or the other, but cannot embrace and unify, is not the ultimate experience. Whether we seek to know by thought or by the vision of knowledge which surpasses thought or by that perfect self-experience in our own being which is the crown and fulfilment of realisation by knowledge, we must be able to think out, see, experience and live the all-satisfying unity. This is what we find in the conception, vision and experience of the One whose oneness does not cease or disappear from view by self-expression in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span>, who is free from bondage to qualities but is yet infinite quality, who contains and combines all relations, yet is ever<span class='page-number' id='s-385' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.385]</span> absolute, who is no one person and yet all persons because He is all being and the one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious Being</span>. For the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> centre we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> ourselves, to enter by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> into this Divine and reproduce its nature in itself is the high and marvellous, yet perfectly rational and most supremely pragmatic and utilitarian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> before us. It is the fulfilment of our self-existence and at the same time the fulfilment of our cosmic existence, of the individual in himself and of the individual in his relation to the cosmic Many. Between these two terms there is no irreconcilable opposition: rather, our own self and the self of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span> having been discovered to be one, there must be between them an intimate unity.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> all these opposite terms are merely general conditions for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of conscious being in that Transcendent who is always one not only behind, but within all conditions however apparently opposite. And the original unifying spirit-stuff of them all and the one substantial mode of them all is that which has been described for the convenience of our thought as the trinity of Sachchidananda. Existence, Consciousness, Bliss, these are everywhere the three inseparable divine terms. None of them is really separate, though our mind and our mental experience can make not only the distinction, but the separation. Mind can say and think \"I was, but unconscious\"—for no being can say \"I am, but unconscious\"—and it can think and feel \"I am, but miserable and without any pleasure in existence.\" In reality this is impossible. The existence we really are, the eternal \"I am\", of which it can never be true to say \"It was\", is nowhere and at no time unconscious. What we call unconsciousness is simply other-consciousness; it is the going in of this surface wave of our mental awareness of outer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> into our subliminal self-awareness and into our awareness too of other planes of existence. We are really no more unconscious when we are asleep or stunned or drugged or \"dead\" or in any other state, than when we are plunged in inner thought oblivious of our physical selves and our surroundings. For anyone who has advanced even a little way in Yoga, this is a most elementary proposition and one which offers no difficulty whatever to the thought because it is<span class='page-number' id='s-386' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.386]</span> proved at every point by experience. It is more difficult to realise that existence and undelight of existence cannot go together. What we call misery, grief, pain, absence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> is again merely a surface wave of the delight of existence which takes on to our mental experience these apparently opposite tints because of a certain trick of false reception in our divided being—which is not our existence at all but only a fragmentary formulation or discoloured spray of conscious-force tossed up by the infinite sea of our self-existence. In order to realise this we have to get away from our absorption in these surface <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span>, these petty tricks of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>,—and when we do get behind and away from them it is surprising how superficial they are, what ridiculously weak and little-penetrating pin-pricks they prove to be,—and we have to realise true existence, and true consciousness, and true experience of existence and consciousness, Sat, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.\n\nChit, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Consciousness</span>, is not our mental self-awareness; that we shall find to be only a form, a lower and limited mode or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. As we progress and awaken to the soul in us and things, we shall realise that there is a consciousness also in the plant, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metal</span>, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>atom</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>electricity</span>, in everything that belongs to physical nature; we shall find even that it is not really in all respects a lower or more limited mode than the mental, on the contrary it is in many \"inanimate\" <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> more intense, rapid, poignant, though less evolved towards the surface. But this also, this consciousness of vital and physical Nature is, compared with Chit, a lower and therefore a limited form, mode and movement. These lower modes of consciousness are the conscious-stuff of inferior planes in one indivisible existence. In ourselves also there is in our subconscious being an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> which is precisely that of the \"inanimate\" physical Nature whence has been constituted the basis of our physical being, another which is that of plant-life, and another which is that of the lower animal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> around us. All these are so much dominated and conditioned by the thinking and reasoning conscious-being in us that we have no real awareness of these lower planes; we are unable to<span class='page-number' id='s-387' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.387]</span> perceive in their own terms what these parts of us are doing, and receive it very imperfectly in the terms and values of the thinking and reasoning mind. Still we know well enough that there is an animal in us as well as that which is characteristically human,—something which is a creature of conscious instinct and impulse, not reflective or rational, as well as that which turns back in thought and will on its experience, meets it from above with the light and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of a higher plane and to some degree controls, uses and modifies it. But the animal in man is only the head of our subhuman being; below it there is much that is also sub-animal and merely vital, much that acts by an instinct and impulse of which the constituting consciousness is withdrawn behind the surface. Below this sub-animal being, there is at a further depth the subvital. When we advance in that ultra-normal self-knowledge and experience which Yoga brings with it, we become aware that the body too has a consciousness of its own; it has habits, impulses, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, an inert yet effective will which differs from that of the rest of our being and can resist it and condition its effectiveness. Much of the struggle in our being is due to this composite existence and the interaction of these varied and heterogeneous planes on each other. For man here is the result of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> and contains in himself the whole of that evolution up from the merely physical and subvital conscious being to the mental creature which at the top he is.\n\nBut this evolution is really a manifestation and just as we have in us these subnormal selves and subhuman planes, so are there in us above our mental being supernormal and superhuman planes. There Chit as the universal conscious-stuff of existence takes other poises, moves out in other modes, on other principles and by other faculties of action. There is above the mind, as the old Vedic sages discovered, a Truth-plane, a plane of self-luminous, self-effective Idea, which can be turned in light and force upon our mind, reason, sentiments, impulses, sensations and use and control them in the sense of the real Truth of things just as we turn our mental reason and will upon our sense-experience and animal nature to use and control them in the sense of our rational and moral perceptions. There<span class='page-number' id='s-388' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.388]</span> there is no seeking, but rather natural possession; no conflict or separation between will and reason, instinct and impulse, desire and experience, idea and reality, but all are in harmony, concomitant, mutually effective, unified in their origin, in their development and in their effectuation. But beyond this plane and attainable through it are others in which the very Chit itself becomes revealed, Chit the elemental origin and primal completeness of all this varied consciousness which is here used for various formation and experience. There will and knowledge and sensation and all the rest of our faculties, powers, modes of experience are not merely harmonious, concomitant, unified, but are one being of consciousness and power of consciousness. It is this Chit which modifies itself so as to become on the Truth-plane the supermind, on the mental plane the mental reason, will, emotion, sensation, on the lower planes the vital or physical instincts, impulses, habits of an obscure force not in superficially conscious possession of itself. All is Chit because all is Sat; all is various movement of the original Consciousness because all is various movement of the original Being.\n\nWhen we find, see or know Chit, we find also that its essence is Ananda or delight of self-existence. To possess self is to possess self-bliss; not to possess self is to be in more or less obscure search of the delight of existence. Chit eternally possesses its self-bliss; and since Chit is the universal conscious-stuff of being, conscious universal being is also in possession of conscious self-bliss, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the universal delight of existence. The Divine whether it manifests itself in All-Quality or in No-Quality, in Personality or Impersonality, in the One absorbing the Many or in the One manifesting its essential multiplicity, is always in possession of self-bliss and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all-bliss</span> because it is always Sachchidananda. For us also to know and possess our true Self in the essential and the universal is to discover the essential and the universal delight of existence, self-bliss and all-bliss. For the universal is only the pouring out of the essential existence, consciousness and delight; and wherever and in whatever form that manifests as existence, there the essential consciousness must be and therefore there must be an essential delight.<span class='page-number' id='s-389' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.389]</span>\n\nThe individual soul does not possess this true nature of itself or realise this true nature of its experience, because it separates itself both from the essential and the universal and identifies itself with the separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>accidents</span>, with the unessential form and mode and with the separate aspect and vehicle. Thus it takes its mind, body, life-stream for its essential self. It tries to assert these for their own sake against the universal, against that of which the universal is the manifestation. It is right in trying to assert and fulfil itself in the universal for the sake of something greater and beyond, but wrong in attempting to do so against the universal and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to a fragmentary aspect of the universal. This fragmentary aspect or rather collection of fragmentary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> it combines around an artificial centre of mental experience, the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, and calls that itself and it serves this ego and lives for its sake instead of living for the sake of that something greater and beyond of which all aspects, even the widest and most general are partial manifestations. This is the living in the false and not the true self; this is living for the sake of and in obedience to the ego and not for the sake of and in obedience to the Divine. The question how this fall has come about and for what purpose it has been done, belongs to the domain of Sankhya rather than of Yoga. We have to seize on the practical fact that to such self-division is due the self-limitation by which we have become unable to possess the true nature of being and experience and are therefore in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> subject to ignorance, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> and suffering. Non-possession of unity is the root cause; to recover unity is the sovereign means, unity with the universal and with that which the universal is here to express. We have to realise the true self of ourselves and of all; and to realise the true self is to realise Sachchidananda.<span class='page-number' id='s-390' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.390]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-realisation-of-sachchidananda","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Difficulties of the Mental Being","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-difficulties-of-the-mental-being","prvt":"The Modes of the Self","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-modes-of-the-self","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-difficulties-of-the-mental-being"],"t":"The Difficulties of the Mental Being","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We have come to this stage in our development of the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span> that we began by affirming the realisation of our pure self, pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> above the terms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, as the first object of this Yoga, but we now affirm that this is not sufficient and that we must also realise the Self or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> in its essential modes and primarily in its triune reality as Sachchidananda.

The other is that of the same existence, consciousness, delight sovereign, free, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of things, acting out of an inalienable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, pouring itself out in infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and quality out of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> self-concentration, the one supreme Person holding in himself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> this play of personality in a vast equal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span>, possessing the infinite phenomenon of the universe without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> but without any inseparable aloofness, with a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> mastery and an innumerable radiation of his eternal luminous self-delight—as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> which he holds, but by which he is not held, which he governs freely and by which therefore he is not bound.

It is the Transcendent possessing them both in His being and employing them both as modes for His manifestation. This then is the object of realisation for the sadhaka of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-391' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.391]</span>\n\nWe see at once that from this point of view the realisation of the pure quiescent self which we gain by withdrawing from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>, is for us only the acquisition of the necessary basis for this greater realisation. Therefore that process is not sufficient for our Yoga; something else is needed more embracingly positive. As we drew back from all that constitutes our apparent self and the phenomenon of the universe in which it dwells to the self-existent, self-conscious Brahman, so we must now repossess our mind, life and body with the all-embracing self-existence, self-consciousness and self-delight of the Brahman. We must not only have the possession of a pure self-existence independent of the world-play, but possess all existence as our own; not only know ourselves as an infinite unegoistic consciousness <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> all change in Time and Space, but become one with all the outpouring of consciousness and its creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> in Time and Space; not only be capable of a fathomless peace and quiescence, but also of a free and an infinite delight in universal things. For that and not only pure calm is Sachchidananda, is the Brahman.\n\nIf it were easily possible to elevate ourselves to the supramental plane and, dwelling securely there, realise world and being, consciousness and action, outgoing and incoming of conscious experience by the power and in the manner of the divine supramental faculties, this realisation would offer no essential <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span>. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is a mental and not yet a supramental being. It is by the mind therefore that he has to aim at knowledge and realise his being, with whatever <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> he can get from the supramental planes. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of our actually realised being and therefore of our Yoga imposes on us certain limitations and primary difficulties which can only be overcome by divine help or an arduous practice, and in reality only by the combination of both these aids. These difficulties in the way of the integral knowledge, the integral realisation, the integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> we have to state succinctly before we can proceed farther.\n\nRealised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> and realised spiritual being are really two different planes in the arrangement of our existence, the one superior and divine, the other inferior and human. To<span class='page-number' id='s-392' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.392]</span> the former belong infinite being, infinite consciousness and will, infinite bliss and the infinite comprehensive and self-effective knowledge of supermind, four divine principles; to the latter belong mental being, vital being, physical being, three human principles. In their apparent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> the two are opposed; each is the reverse of the other. The divine is infinite and immortal being; the human is life limited in time and scope and form, life that is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> attempting to become life that is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. The divine is infinite consciousness transcending and embracing all that it manifests within it; the human is consciousness rescued from a sleep of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span>, subjected to the means it uses, limited by body and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> and attempting to find its relation to other consciousnesses, bodies, egos positively by various means of uniting contact and sympathy, negatively by various means of hostile contact and antipathy. The divine is inalienable self-bliss and inviolable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all-bliss</span>; the human is sensation of mind and body seeking for delight, but finding only pleasure, indifference and pain. The divine is supramental knowledge comprehending all and supramental will effecting all; the human is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> reaching out to knowledge by the comprehension of things in parts and parcels which it has to join clumsily together, and it is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> attempting to acquire force and will through a gradual extension of power corresponding to its gradual extension of knowledge; and this extension it can only bring about by a partial and parcelled exercise of will corresponding to the partial and parcelled method of its knowledge. The divine founds itself upon unity and is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the transcendences and totalities of things; the human founds itself on separated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> and is the subject even when the master of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> and fragmentations and their difficult solderings and unifyings. Between the two there are for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> a veil and a lid which prevent the human not only from attaining but even from knowing the divine.\n\nWhen, therefore, the mental being seeks to know the divine, to realise it, to become it, it has first to lift this lid, to put by this veil. But when it succeeds in that difficult endeavour, it sees the divine as something superior to it, distant, high, conceptually,<span class='page-number' id='s-393' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.393]</span> vitally, even physically above it, to which it looks up from its own humble station and to which it has, if at all that be possible, to rise, or if it be not possible, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> that down to itself, to be subject to it and to adore. It sees the divine as a superior plane of being, and then it regards it as a supreme state of existence, a heaven or a Sat or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span> according to the nature of its own conception or realisation. Or it sees it as a supreme Being other than itself or at least other than its own present self, and then it calls it God under one name or another, and views it as personal or impersonal, qualitied or without qualities, silent and indifferent Power or active Lord and Helper, again according to its own conception or realisation, its vision or understanding of some side or some aspect of that Being. Or it sees it as a supreme Reality of which its own imperfect being is a reflection or from which it has become detached, and then it calls it Self or Brahman and qualifies it variously, always according to its own conception or realisation,—Existence, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Non-Existence</span>, Tao, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nihil</span>, Force, Unknowable.\n\nIf then we seek mentally to realise Sachchidananda, there is likely to be this first difficulty that we shall see it as something above, beyond, around even in a sense, but with a gulf between that being and our being, an unbridged or even an unbridgeable chasm. There is this infinite existence; but it is quite other than the mental being who becomes aware of it, and we cannot either raise ourselves to it and become it or bring it down to ourselves so that our own experience of our being and world-being shall be that of its blissful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span>. There is this great, boundless, unconditioned consciousness and force; but our consciousness and force stands apart from it, even if within it, limited, petty, discouraged, disgusted with itself and the world, but unable to participate in that higher thing which it has seen. There is this immeasurable and unstained bliss; but our own being remains the sport of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower Nature</span> of pleasure and pain and dull neutral sensation incapable of its divine delight. There is this perfect Knowledge and Will; but our own remains always the mental deformed knowledge and limping will incapable of sharing in or even being in tune with that nature of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span>. Or else so long<span class='page-number' id='s-394' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.394]</span> as we live purely in an ecstatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span> of that vision, we are delivered from ourselves; but the moment we again turn our consciousness upon our own being, we fall away from it and it disappears or becomes remote and intangible. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> leaves us; the Vision vanishes; we are back again in the pettiness of our mortal existence.\n\nSomehow this chasm has to be bridged. And here there are two possibilities for the mental being. One possibility is for it to rise by a great, prolonged, concentrated, all-forgetting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> out of itself into the Supreme. But in this effort the mind has to leave its own consciousness, to disappear into another and temporarily or permanently lose itself, if not quite abolish. It has to go into the trance of Samadhi. For this reason the Raja and other systems of Yoga give a supreme importance to the state of Samadhi or Yogic trance in which the mind withdraws not only from its ordinary interests and preoccupations, but first from all consciousness of outward act and sense and being and then from all consciousness of inward mental activities. In this its inward-gathered state the mental being may have different kinds of realisation of the Supreme in itself or in various aspects or on various levels, but the ideal is to get rid of mind altogether and, going beyond mental realisation, to enter into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> trance in which all sign of mind or lower existence ceases. But this is a state of consciousness to which few can attain and from which not all can return.\n\nIt is obvious, since mind-consciousness is the sole waking state possessed by mental being, that it cannot ordinarily quite enter into another without leaving behind completely both all our waking existence and all our inward mind. This is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of the Yogic trance. But one cannot continually remain in this trance; or, even if one could persist in it for an indefinitely long period, it is always likely to be broken in upon by any strong or persistent call on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bodily life</span>. And when one returns to the mental consciousness, one is back again in the lower being. Therefore it has been said that complete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> from the human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, complete ascension from the life of the mental being is impossible until the body and the bodily life are<span class='page-number' id='s-395' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.395]</span> finally cast off. The ideal upheld before the Yogin who follows this method is to renounce all desire and every least velleity of the human life, of the mental existence, to detach himself utterly from the world and, entering more and more frequently and more and more deeply into the most concentrated state of Samadhi, finally to leave the body while in that utter in-gathering of the being so that it may depart into the supreme Existence. It is also by reason of this apparent incompatibility of mind and Spirit that so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> religions and systems are led to condemn the world and look forward only to a heaven beyond or else a void Nirvana or supreme featureless self-existence in the Supreme.\n\nBut what under these circumstances is the human mind which seeks the divine to do with its waking moments? For if these are subject to all the disabilities of mortal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>, if they are open to the attacks of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span>, passion, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>greed</span>, desire, it is irrational to suppose that by the mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of the mental being in the Yogic trance at the moment of putting off the body, the soul can pass away without return into the supreme existence. For the man's normal consciousness is still subject to what the Buddhists call the chain or the stream of Karma; it is still creating energies which must continue and have their effect in a continued life of the mental being which is creating them. Or, to take another point of view, consciousness being the determining <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> and not the bodily existence which is only a result, the man still belongs normally to the status of human, or at least mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and this cannot be abrogated by the fact of passing out of the physical body; to get rid of mortal body is not to get rid of mortal mind. Nor is it sufficient to have a dominant disgust of the world or an anti-vital indifference or aversion to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> existence; for this too belongs to the lower mental status and activity. The highest teaching is that even the desire for liberation with all its mental concomitants must be surpassed before the soul can be entirely free. Therefore not only must the mind be able to rise in abnormal states out of itself into a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span>, but its waking mentality also must be entirely spiritualised.\n\nThis brings into the field the second possibility open to the<span class='page-number' id='s-396' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.396]</span> mental being; for if its first possibility is to rise out of itself into a divine supramental plane of being, the other is to call down the divine into itself so that its mentality shall be changed into an image of the divine, shall be divinised or spiritualised. This may be done and primarily must be done by the mind's power of reflecting that which it knows, relates to its own consciousness, contemplates. For the mind is really a reflector and a medium and none of its activities originate in themselves, none exist *per se*. Ordinarily, the mind reflects the status of mortal nature and the activities of the Force which works under the conditions of the material universe. But if it becomes clear, passive, pure by the renunciation of these activities and of the characteristic ideas and outlook of mental nature, then as in a clear mirror or like the sky in clear water which is without ripple and unruffled by winds, the divine is reflected. The mind still does not entirely possess the divine or become divine, but is possessed by it or by a luminous reflection of it so long as it remains in this pure passivity. If it becomes active, it falls back into the disturbance of the mortal nature and reflects that and no longer the divine. For this reason an absolute quietism and a cessation first of all outer action and then of all inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is the ideal ordinarily proposed; here too, for the follower of the path of knowledge, there must be a sort of waking Samadhi. Whatever action is unavoidable, must be a purely superficial working of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> of perception and motor action in which the quiescent mind takes eventually no part and from which it seeks no result or profit.\n\nBut this is insufficient for the integral Yoga. There must be a positive transformation and not merely a negative quiescence of the waking mentality. The transformation is possible because, although the divine planes are above the mental consciousness and to enter actually into them we have ordinarily to lose the mental in Samadhi, yet there are in the mental being divine planes superior to our normal mentality which reproduce the conditions of the divine plane proper, although modified by the conditions, dominant here, of mentality. All that belongs to the experience of the divine plane can there be seized, but in the<span class='page-number' id='s-397' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.397]</span> mental way and in a mental form. To these planes of divine mentality it is possible for the developed human being to arise in the waking state; or it is possible for him to derive from them a stream of influences and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> which shall eventually open to them and transform into their nature his whole waking existence. These higher mental states are the immediate sources, the large actual instruments, the inner stations[^1] of his perfection.\n\n[^1]: Called in the Veda variously seats, houses, placings or statuses, footings, earths, dwelling-places, *sadas, gṛha* or *kṣaya, dhāma, padam, bhūmi, kṣiti*.\n\nBut in arriving to these planes or deriving from them the limitations of our mentality pursue us. In the first place the mind is an inveterate divider of the indivisible and its whole nature is to dwell on one thing at a time to the exclusion of others or to stress it to the subordination of others. Thus in approaching Sachchidananda it will dwell on its aspect of the pure existence, Sat, and consciousness and bliss are compelled then to lose themselves or remain quiescent in the experience of pure, infinite being which leads to the realisation of the quietistic Monist. Or it will dwell on the aspect of consciousness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit</span>, and existence and bliss become then dependent on the experience of an infinite transcendent Power and Conscious-Force, which leads to the realisation of the Tantric worshipper of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Energy</span>. Or it will dwell on the aspect of delight, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, and existence and consciousness then seem to disappear into a bliss without basis of self-possessing awareness or constituent being, which leads to the realisation of the Buddhistic seeker of Nirvana. Or it will dwell on some aspect of Sachchidananda which comes to the mind from the supramental Knowledge, Will or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span>, and then the infinite impersonal aspect of Sachchidananda is almost or quite lost in the experience of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Deity</span> which leads to the realisations of the various religions and to the possession of some supernal world or divine status of the human soul in relation to God. And for those whose object is to depart anywhither from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> existence, this is enough, since they are able by the mind's immergence into or seizure upon any one of these principles or aspects to effect through status in the divine planes of their<span class='page-number' id='s-398' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.398]</span> mentality or the possession by them of their waking state this desired transit.\n\nBut the sadhaka of the integral Yoga has to harmonise all so that they may become a plenary and equal unity of the full realisation of Sachchidananda. Here the last difficulty of mind meets him, its inability to hold at once the unity and the multiplicity. It is not altogether difficult to arrive at and dwell in a pure infinite or even, at the same time, a perfect global experience of the Existence which is Consciousness which is Delight. The mind may even extend its experience of this Unity to the multiplicity so as to perceive it immanent in the universe and in each object, force, movement in the universe or at the same time to be aware of this Existence-Consciousness-Bliss containing the universe and enveloping all its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> and originating all its movements. It is difficult indeed for it to unite and harmonise rightly all these experiences; but still it can possess Sachchidananda at once in himself and immanent in all and the continent of all. But with this to unite the final experience of all this as Sachchidananda and possess objects, movements, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> as no other than He, is the great difficulty for mind. Separately any of these things may be done; the mind may go from one to the other, rejecting one as it arrives at another and calling this the lower or that the higher existence. But to unify without losing, to integralise without rejecting is its supreme difficulty.<span class='page-number' id='s-399' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.399]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-difficulties-of-the-mental-being","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Passive and the Active Brahman","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-passive-and-the-active-brahman","prvt":"The Realisation of Sachchidananda","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-realisation-of-sachchidananda","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-passive-and-the-active-brahman"],"t":"The Passive and the Active Brahman","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The difficulty which the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> in arriving at an integral realisation of true being and world-being may be met by following <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> or other of two different lines of his self-development.

This seems to have been the method of the most ancient sages of which we get some glimpse in the Rig Veda and some of the Upanishads.[^1] He may, on the other hand, aim straight at the realisation of pure self-existence on the highest plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> and from that secure basis realise spiritually under the conditions of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> the process by which the self-existent becomes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> existences, but without that descent into the self-divided egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> which is a circumstance of evolution in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>. Thus identified with Sachchidananda in the universal self-existence as the spiritualised mental being, he may then ascend <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> to the supramental plane of the pure spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. It is the latter method the stages of which we may now attempt to trace for the seeker by the path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>.\n\n[^1]: Notably, the Taittiriya Upanishad.\n\nWhen the sadhaka has followed the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of withdrawal from the various identifications of the self with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, he has arrived at realisation by knowledge of a pure, still, self-aware existence, one, undivided, peaceful,<span class='page-number' id='s-400' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.400]</span> inactive, undisturbed by the action of the world. The only relation that this Self seems to have with the world is that of a disinterested Witness not at all involved in or affected or even touched by any of its activities. If this state of consciousness is pushed farther one becomes aware of a self even more remote from world-existence; all that is in the world is in a sense in that Self and yet at the same time extraneous to its consciousness, non-existent in its existence, existing only in a sort of unreal mind,—a dream therefore, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>. This aloof and transcendent Real Existence may be realised as an utter Self of one's own being; or the very idea of a self and of one's own being may be swallowed up in it, so that it is only for the mind an unknowable That, unknowable to the mental consciousness and without any possible kind of actual connection or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> with world-existence. It can even be realised by the mental being as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nihil</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Non-Existence</span> or Void, but a Void of all that is in the world, a Non-existence of all that is in the world and yet the only Reality. To proceed farther towards that Transcendence by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of one's own being upon it is to lose mental existence and world-existence altogether and cast oneself into the Unknowable.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> of knowledge demands instead a divine return upon world-existence and its first step must be to realise the Self as the All, *sarvaṁ <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brahma</span>*. First, concentrating on the Self-existent, we have to realise all of which the mind and senses are aware as a figure of things existing in this pure Self that we now are to our own consciousness. This vision of the pure self translates itself to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind-sense</span> and the mind-perception as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> Reality in which all exists merely as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span>, not precisely unreal, not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hallucination</span> or a dream, but still only a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of the consciousness, perceptual and subtly sensible rather than substantial. In this poise of the consciousness all seems to be, if not a dream, yet very much like a representation or puppet-show taking place in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, motionless, peaceful, indifferent Self. Our own phenomenal existence is part of this conceptual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, a mechanical form of mind and body among other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, ourselves a name of being<span class='page-number' id='s-401' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.401]</span> among other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span>, automatically mobile in this Self with its all-encompassing, still self-awareness. The active consciousness of the world is not present in this state to our realisation, because thought has been stilled in us and therefore our own consciousness is perfectly still and inactive,—whatever we do, seems to be purely mechanical, not attended with any conscious origination by our active will and knowledge. Or if thought occurs, that also happens mechanically like the rest, like the movement of our body, moved by the unseen springs of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> as in the plant and element and not by any active will of our self-existence. For this Self is the immobile and does not originate or take part in the action which it allows. This Self is the All in the sense only of being the infinite One who is immutably and contains all names and forms.\n\nThe basis of this status of consciousness is the mind's exclusive realisation of pure self-existence in which consciousness is at rest, inactive, widely concentrated in pure self-awareness of being, not active and originative of any kind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>. Its aspect of knowledge is at rest in the awareness of undifferentiated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>; its aspect of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and will is at rest in the awareness of unmodifiable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutability</span>. And yet it is aware of names and forms, it is aware of movement; but this movement does not seem to proceed from the Self, but to go on by some inherent power of its own and only to be reflected in the Self. In other words, the mental being has put away from himself by exclusive concentration the dynamic aspect of consciousness, has taken refuge in the static and built a wall of non-communication between the two; between the passive and the active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> a gulf has been created and they stand on either side of it, the one visible to the other but with no contact, no touch of sympathy, no sense of unity between them. Therefore to the passive Self all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> seems to be passive in its nature, all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> seems to be non-conscious in itself and mechanical (*jaḍa*) in its movement. The realisation of this status is the basis of the ancient Sankhya philosophy which taught that the Purusha or Conscious-Soul is a passive, inactive, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> entity, Prakriti or the Nature-Soul including even<span class='page-number' id='s-402' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.402]</span> the mind and the understanding active, mutable, mechanical, but reflected in the Purusha which identifies itself with what is reflected in it and lends to it its own light of consciousness. When the Purusha learns not to identify himself, then Prakriti begins to fall away from its impulse of movement and returns towards equilibrium and rest. The Vedantic view of the same status led to the philosophy of the inactive Self or Brahman as the one reality and of all the rest as name and form imposed on it by a false activity of mental illusion which has to be removed by right knowledge of the immutable Self and refusal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imposition</span>.[^2] The two views really differ only in their language and their viewpoint; substantially, they are the same intellectual generalisation from the same spiritual experience.\n\n[^2]: *adhyāropa.*\n\nIf we rest here, there are only two possible attitudes towards the world. Either we must remain as mere inactive witnesses of the world-play or act in it mechanically without any participation of the conscious self and by mere play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> of sense and motor-action.[^3] In the former <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> what we do is to approach as completely as possible to the inactivity of the passive and silent Brahman. We have stilled our mind and silenced the activity of the thought and the disturbances of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, we have arrived at an entire inner peace and indifference; we attempt now to still the mechanical action of the life and body, to reduce it to the most meagre minimum possible so that it may eventually cease entirely and for ever. This, the final aim of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> Yoga which refuses life, is evidently not our aim. By the alternative choice we can have an activity perfect enough in outward appearance along with an entire inner passivity, peace, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental silence</span>, indifference and cessation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, absence of choice in the will.\n\n[^3]: *kevalair indriyair.*\n\n  <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span>.\n\nTo the ordinary mind this does not seem possible. As, emotionally, it cannot conceive of activity without desire and emotional preference, so intellectually it cannot conceive of activity without thought-conception, conscious motive and energising of the will. But, as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, we see that a large part of our<span class='page-number' id='s-403' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.403]</span> own action as well as the whole activity of inanimate and merely animate life is done by a mechanical impulse and movement in which these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> are not, openly at least, at work. It may be said that this is only possible of the purely physical and vital activity and not of those movements which ordinarily depend upon the functioning of the conceptual and volitional mind, such as speech, writing and all the intelligent action of human life. But this again is not true, as we find when we are able to go behind the habitual and normal process of our mental nature. It has been found by recent psychological experiment that all these operations can be effected without any conscious origination in the thought and will of the apparent actor; his organs of sense and action, including the speech, become passive instruments for a thought and will other than his.\n\nCertainly, behind all intelligent action there must be an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligent will</span>, but it need not be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> or the will of the conscious mind in the actor. In the psychological phenomena of which I have spoken, it is obviously in some of them the will and intelligence of other human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> that uses the organs, in others it is doubtful whether it is an influence or actuation by other beings or the emergence of a subconscious, subliminal mind or a mixed combination of both these agencies. But in this Yogic status of action by the mere organs, *kevalair indriyair*, it is the universal intelligence and will of Nature itself working from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> superconscious and subconscious as it acts in the mechanically purposeful energies of plant-life or of the inanimate material form, but here with a living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> who is the conscious witness of the action and instrumentation. It is a remarkable fact that the speech, writing and intelligent actions of such a state may convey a perfect force of thought, luminous, faultless, logical, inspired, perfectly adapting means to ends, far beyond what the man himself could have done in his old normal poise of mind and will and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, yet all the time he himself perceives but does not conceive the thought that comes to him, observes in its works but does not appropriate or use the will that acts through him, witnesses but does not claim as his own the powers which play upon the world through him as through<span class='page-number' id='s-404' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.404]</span> a passive channel. But this phenomenon is not really abnormal or contrary to the general law of things. For do we not see a perfect working of the secret universal Will and Intelligence in the apparently brute (*jaḍa*) action of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span>? And it is precisely this universal Will and Intelligence which thus acts through the calm, indifferent and inwardly silent Yogin who offers no obstacle of limited and ignorant personal will and intelligence to its operations. He dwells in the silent Self; he allows the active Brahman to work through his natural instruments, accepting impartially, without participation, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> of its universal force and knowledge.\n\nThis status of an inner passivity and an outer action independent of each other is a state of entire spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>. The Yogin, as the Gita says, even in acting does no actions, for it is not he, but universal Nature directed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of Nature which is at work. He is not bound by his works, nor do they leave any after effects or consequences in his mind, nor cling to or leave any mark on his soul;[^4] they vanish and are dissolved[^5] by their very execution and leave the immutable self unaffected and the soul unmodified. Therefore this would seem to be the poise the uplifted soul ought to take, if it has still to preserve any relations with human action in the world-existence, an unalterable silence, tranquillity, passivity within, an action without regulated by the universal Will and Wisdom which works, as the Gita says, without being involved in, bound by or ignorantly attached to its works. And certainly this poise of a perfect activity founded upon a perfect inner passivity is that which the Yogin has to possess, as we have seen in the Yoga of Works. But here in this status of self-knowledge at which we have arrived, there is an evident absence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span>; for there is still a gulf, an unrealised unity or a cleft of consciousness between the passive and the active Brahman. We have still to possess consciously the active Brahman without losing the possession of the silent Self. We have to preserve the inner silence, tranquillity,<span class='page-number' id='s-405' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.405]</span> passivity as a foundation; but in place of an aloof indifference to the works of the active Brahman we have to arrive at an equal and impartial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in them; in place of a refusal to participate lest our freedom and peace be lost we have to arrive at a conscious possession of the active Brahman whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of existence does not abrogate His peace, nor His lordship of all workings impair His calm freedom in the midst of His works.\n\n[^4]: *na karma lipyate nare.*\n\n  <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Isha</span> Upanishad.\n\n[^5]: *pravilīyante karmāṇi.*\n\n  Gita.\n\nThe difficulty is created by the exclusive concentration of the mental being on its plane of pure existence in which consciousness is at rest in passivity and delight of existence at rest in peace of existence. It has to embrace also its plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> of existence in which consciousness is active as power and will and delight is active as joy of existence. Here the difficulty is that mind is likely to precipitate itself into the consciousness of Force instead of possessing it. The extreme mental state of precipitation into Nature is that of the ordinary man who takes his bodily and vital activity and the mind-movements dependent on them for his whole real existence and regards all passivity of the soul as a departure from existence and an approach towards nullity. He lives in the superficies of the active Brahman and while to the silent soul exclusively concentrated in the passive self all activities are mere name and form, to him they are the only reality and it is the Self that is merely a name. In one the passive Brahman stands aloof from the active and does not share in its consciousness; in the other the active Brahman stands aloof from the passive and does not share in its consciousness nor wholly possess its own. Each is to the other in these exclusivenesses an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> of status or an inertia of mechanically active non-possession of self if not altogether an unreality. But the sadhaka who has once seen firmly the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of things and tasted thoroughly the peace of the silent Self, is not likely to be content with any state which involves loss of self-knowledge or a sacrifice of the peace of the soul. He will not precipitate himself back into the mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> movement of mind and life and body with all its ignorance and straining and disturbance. Whatever new status he may acquire, will only satisfy him if it is founded upon and includes that which he has already<span class='page-number' id='s-406' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.406]</span> found to be indispensable to real self-knowledge, self-delight and self-possession.\n\nStill there is the likelihood of a partial, superficial and temporary relapse into the old mental movement when he attempts again to ally himself to the activity of the world. To prevent this relapse or to cure it when it arrives, he has to hold fast to the truth of Sachchidananda and extend his realisation of the infinite One into the movement of the infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span>. He has to concentrate on and realise the one Brahman in all things as conscious force of being as well as pure awareness of conscious being. The Self as the All, not only in the unique essence of things, but in the manifold form of things, not only as containing all in a transcendent consciousness, but as becoming all by a constituting consciousness, this is the next step towards his true possession of existence. In proportion as this realisation is accomplished, the status of consciousness as well as the mental view proper to it will change. Instead of an immutable Self containing name and form, containing without sharing in them the mutations of Nature, there will be the consciousness of the Self immutable in essence, unalterable in its fundamental poise but constituting and becoming in its experience all these existences which the mind distinguishes as name and form. All formations of mind and body will be not merely figures reflected in the Purusha, but real forms of which Brahman, Self, conscious Being is the substance and, as it were, the material of their formation. The name attaching to the form will be not a mere conception of the mind answering to no real existence bearing the name, but there will be behind it a true power of conscious being, a true self-experience of the Brahman answering to something that it contained potential but unmanifest in its silence. And yet in all its mutations it will be realised as one, free and above them. The realisation of a sole Reality suffering the imposition of names and forms will give place to that of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> Being throwing itself out into infinite becoming. All existences will be to the consciousness of the Yogin soul-forms and not merely idea-forms of the Self, of himself, one with him, contained in his universal existence.

The Self will be realised as the all in its double aspect of immutable status and mutable activity and it is this that will be seen as the comprehensive truth of our existence.<span class='page-number' id='s-408' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.408]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-passive-and-the-active-brahman","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Cosmic Consciousness","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-cosmic-consciousness","prvt":"The Difficulties of the Mental Being","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-difficulties-of-the-mental-being","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-cosmic-consciousness"],"t":"The Cosmic Consciousness","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"To realise and unite oneself with the active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> is to exchange, perfectly or imperfectly according as the union is partial or complete, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>.

Looking back from this Individual to that of which it is the representative and conscious figure, he can get back to the transcendent consciousness of pure Self, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> Existence or absolute Non-being, three poises of the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> Reality.

We can arrive at that, become that whether by breaking the walls of the ego laterally, as it were, and identifying oneself with all existences in the One, or else from above by realising the pure Self or absolute Existence in its outgoing, immanent, all-embracing, all-constituting self-knowledge and self-creative power.\n\nThe immanent, silent Self in all is the foundation of this cosmic consciousness for the experience of the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>. It<span class='page-number' id='s-409' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.409]</span> is the Witness pure and omnipresent who as the silent Conscious Soul of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span> regards all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of the universe; it is Sachchidananda for whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> universal Nature displays the eternal procession of her works.

Because of that all this exists, but that does not exist because of all this; it is too great to be limited by the movement in Time and Space which it inhabits and supports. This foundation enables us to possess in the security of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> existence the whole universe within our own being. We are no longer limited and shut in by what we inhabit, but like the Divine contain in ourselves all that for the purpose of the movement of Nature we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to inhabit. We are not mind or life or body, but the informing and sustaining Soul, silent, peaceful, eternal, which possesses them; and since we find this Soul everywhere sustaining and informing and possessing all lives and minds and bodies, we cease to regard it as a separate and individual being in our own. In it all this moves and acts; within all this it is stable and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span>. Having this, we possess our eternal self-existence at rest in its eternal consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>.\n\nNext we have to realise this silent Self as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of universal Nature; we have to see that it is this same Self-existent who is displayed in the creative force of His eternal consciousness. All this action is only His power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and self-delight going abroad in His infinite being to do the works of His eternal wisdom and will.

We shall realise it next as itself going abroad in its Power and Knowledge,—for the Power and Knowledge are itself,—not only the source of their works, but the creator and<span class='page-number' id='s-410' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.410]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> of their works, one in all existences; for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> souls of the universal manifestation are only faces of the one Divine, the many minds, lives, bodies are only His masks and disguises. We perceive each being to be the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Narayana</span> presenting to us many faces; we lose ourselves in that universality and perceive our own mind, life and body as only one presentation of the Self, while all whom we formerly conceived of as others, are now to our consciousness our self in other minds, lives and bodies. All force and idea and event and figure of things in the universe are only manifest degrees of this Self, values of the Divine in His eternal self-figuration. Thus viewing things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> we may see them first as if they were parts and parcels of His divided being;[^1] but the realisation and the knowledge are not complete unless we go <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> this idea of quality and space and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> by which there comes the experience of less and more, large and small, part and whole, and see the whole Infinite everywhere; we must see the universe and each thing in the universe as in its existence and secret consciousness and power and delight the indivisible Divine in its entirety, however much the figure it makes to our minds may appear only as a partial manifestation. When we possess thus the Divine as at once the silent and surpassing Witness and the active Lord and all-constituting Being without making any division between these aspects, we possess the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Divine</span>, embrace all of the universal Self and Reality, are awake to the cosmic consciousness.\n\n[^1]: The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> speaks of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span> as a portion of the Lord.\n\nWhat will be the relation of our individual existence to this cosmic consciousness to which we have attained? For since we have still a mind and body and human life, our individual existence persists even though our separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual consciousness</span> has been transcended. It is quite possible to realise the cosmic consciousness without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> that; we can see it, that is to say, with the soul, feel it and dwell in it; we can even be united with it without becoming wholly one with it; in a word, we may preserve the individual consciousness of the Jivatman within the cosmic consciousness of the universal Self. We may preserve a<span class='page-number' id='s-411' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.411]</span> yet greater distinctness between the two and enjoy the relations between them; we may remain, in a way, entirely the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span> while participating in the bliss and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> of the universal Self. Or we may possess them both as a greater and lesser self, one we feel pouring itself out in the universal play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> and force, the other in the action of the same universal Being through our individual soul-centre or soul-form for the purposes of an individual play of mind, life and body. But the summit of this cosmic realisation by knowledge is always the power to dissolve the personality in universal being, to merge the individual in the cosmic consciousness, to liberate even the soul-form into the unity and universality of the Spirit. This is the *laya*, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span>, or *mokṣa*, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, at which the Yoga of Knowledge <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>. This may extend itself, as in the traditional Yoga, to the dissolution of mind, life and body itself into the silent Self or absolute Existence; but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the liberation is the merging of the individual in the Infinite. When the Yogin no longer feels himself to be a consciousness situated in the body or limited by the mind, but has lost the sense of division in the boundlessness of an infinite consciousness, that which he set out to do is accomplished. Afterwards the retaining or non-retaining of the human life is a circumstance of no essential importance, for it is always the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> One who acts through its many <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of the mind and life and body and each soul is only one of the stations from which it chooses to watch and receive and actuate its own play.\n\nThat into which we merge ourselves in the cosmic consciousness is Sachchidananda. It is one eternal Existence that we then are, one eternal Consciousness which sees its own works in us and others, one eternal Will or Force of that Consciousness which displays itself in infinite workings, one eternal Delight which has the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of itself and all its workings. It is itself stable, immutable, timeless, spaceless, supreme and it is still itself in the infinity of its workings, not changed by their variations, not broken up by their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span>, not increased or diminished by their ebbings and flowings in the seas of Time and Space, not confused by their apparent contrarieties or limited by their divinely-willed<span class='page-number' id='s-412' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.412]</span> limitations. Sachchidananda is the unity of the many-sidedness of manifested things, Sachchidananda is the eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of all their variations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oppositions</span>, Sachchidananda is the infinite perfection which justifies their limitations and is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imperfections</span>.\n\nSo much for the essential relation; but we have to see also the practical results of this internal transformation. It is evident that by dwelling in this cosmic consciousness our whole experience and valuation of everything in the universe will be radically changed. As individual egos we dwell in the Ignorance and judge everything by a broken, partial and personal standard of knowledge; we experience everything according to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of a limited consciousness and force and are therefore unable to give a divine response or set the true value upon any part of cosmic experience. We experience <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>, weakness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>, pain, struggle and its contradictory <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> and we accept these things and their opposites as opposites in an eternal duality and cannot reconcile them in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternity</span> of an absolute good and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span>. We live by fragments of experience and judge by our fragmentary values each thing and the whole. When we try to arrive at absolute values we only promote some partial view of things to do <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> for a totality in the divine workings; we then make believe that our fractions are integers and try to thrust our one-sided view-points into the catholicity of the all-vision of the Divine.\n\nBut by entering into the cosmic consciousness we begin to participate in that all-vision and see everything in the values of the Infinite and the One. Limitation itself, ignorance itself change their meaning for us. Ignorance changes into a particularising action of divine knowledge; strength and weakness and incapacity change into a free putting forth and holding back various measures of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Force</span>; joy and grief, pleasure and pain change into a mastering and a suffering of divine delight; struggle, losing its discords, becomes a balancing of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> and values in the divine harmony. We do not then suffer by the limitations of our mind, life and body; for we no longer live in these, even when we record and accept them, but in the infinity of the Spirit, and<span class='page-number' id='s-413' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.413]</span> these we view in their right value and place and purpose in the manifestation, as degrees of the supreme being, conscious-force and delight of Sachchidananda veiling and manifesting Himself in the cosmos. We cease also to judge other men and things by their outward appearances and are delivered from hostile and contradictory ideas and emotions; for it is the soul that we see, the Divine that we seek and find in every thing and creature, and the rest has only a secondary value to us in a scheme of relations which exist now for us only as self-expressions of the Divine and not as having any absolute value in themselves. So too no event can disturb us, since the distinction of happy and unhappy, beneficent and maleficent happenings loses its force, and all is seen in its divine value and its divine purpose. Thus we arrive at a perfect liberation and an infinite equality. It is this consummation of which the Upanishad speaks when it says \"He in whom the self has become all existences, how shall he have delusion, whence shall he have grief who knows entirely[^2] and sees in all things <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>.\"\n\n[^2]: *Vijānataḥ.* Vijnana is the knowledge of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One and the Many</span>, by which the Many are seen in the terms of the One, in the infinite unifying Truth, Right, Vast of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span>.\n\nBut this can be only when there is perfection in the cosmic consciousness, and that is difficult for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> when it arrives at the idea or the realisation of the Spirit, the Divine, tends to break existence into two opposite halves, the lower and the higher existence. It sees on one side the Infinite, the Formless, the One, the Peace and Bliss, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Calm</span> and Silence, the Absolute, the Vast and Pure; on the other it sees the finite, the world of forms, the jarring multiplicity, the strife and suffering and imperfect, unreal good, the tormented activity and futile success, the relative, the limited and vain and vile. To those who make this division and this opposition, complete liberation is only attainable in the peace of the One, in the featurelessness of the Infinite, in the non-becoming of the Absolute which is to them the only real being; to be free all values must be destroyed, all limitations not only transcended but abolished.<span class='page-number' id='s-414' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.414]</span> They have the liberation of the divine rest, but not the liberty of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span>; they enjoy the peace of the Transcendent, but not the cosmic bliss of the Transcendent. Their liberty depends upon abstention from the cosmic movement, it cannot dominate and possess cosmic existence itself. But it is also possible for them to realise and participate in the immanent as well as the transcendent peace. Still the division is not cured. The liberty they enjoy is that of the silent unacting Witness, not the liberty of the divine Master-consciousness which possesses all things, delights in all, casts itself into all forms of existence without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of fall or loss or bondage or stain. All the rights of the Spirit are not yet possessed; there is still a denial, a limitation, a holding back from the entire oneness of all existence. The workings of Mind, Life, Body are viewed from the calm and peace of the spiritual planes of the mental being and are filled with that calm and peace; they are not possessed by and subjected to the law of the all-mastering Spirit.\n\nAll this is when the mental being takes its station in its own spiritual planes, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental planes</span> of Sat, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, and casts down their light and delight upon the lower existence. But there is possible the attempt at a kind of cosmic consciousness by dwelling on the lower planes themselves after breaking their limitations laterally, as we have said, and then calling down into them the light and largeness of the higher existence. Not only Spirit is one, but Mind, Life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> are one. There is one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Mind</span>, one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic Life</span>, one cosmic Body. All the attempt of man to arrive at universal sympathy, universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and the understanding and knowledge of the inner soul of other existences is an attempt to beat thin, breach and eventually break down by the power of the enlarging mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> the walls of the ego and arrive nearer to a cosmic oneness. And if we can by the mind and heart get at the touch of the Spirit, receive the powerful inrush of the Divine into this lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> and change our nature into a reflection of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span> by love, by universal joy, by oneness of mind with all Nature and all beings, we can break down the walls. Even our bodies are not really separate entities and therefore our very physical consciousness is capable<span class='page-number' id='s-415' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.415]</span> of oneness with the physical consciousness of others and of the cosmos. The Yogin is able to feel his body one with all bodies, to be aware of and even to participate in their affections; he can feel constantly the unity of all Matter and be aware of his physical being as only a movement in its movement.[^3] Still more is it possible for him to feel constantly and normally the whole sea of the infinite life as his true vital existence and his own life as only a wave of that boundless surge. And more easily yet is it possible for him to unite himself in mind and heart with all existences, be aware of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, struggles, joys, sorrows, thoughts, impulses, in a sense as if they were his own, at least as occurring in his larger self hardly less intimately or quite as intimately as the movements of his own heart and mind. This too is a realisation of cosmic consciousness.\n\n[^3]: *jagatyāṁ <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>jagat</span>.*\n\n  <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Isha</span> Upanishad.\n\nIt may even seem as if it were the greatest oneness, since it accepts all that we can be sensible of in the mind-created world as our own. Sometimes one sees it spoken of as the highest achievement. Certainly, it is a great realisation and the path to a greater. It is that which the Gita speaks of as the accepting of all existences as if oneself whether in grief or in joy; it is the way of sympathetic oneness and infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>compassion</span> which helps the Buddhist to arrive at his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. Still there are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> and degrees. In the first stage the soul is still subject to the reactions of the duality, still subject therefore to the lower Prakriti; it is depressed or hurt by the cosmic suffering, elated by the cosmic joy. We suffer the joys of others, suffer their griefs; and this oneness can be carried even into the body, as in the story of the Indian saint who, seeing a bullock tortured in the field by its cruel owner, cried out with the creature's pain and the weal of the lash was found reproduced on his own flesh. But there must be a oneness with Sachchidananda in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> as well as with the subjection of the lower being to the reactions of Prakriti. This is achieved when the soul is free and superior to the cosmic reactions which are then felt only in the life, mind and body and as an inferior movement; the soul understands, accepts the<span class='page-number' id='s-416' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.416]</span> experience, sympathises, but is not overpowered or affected, so that at last even the mind and body learn also to accept without being overpowered or even affected except on their surface. And the consummation of this movement is when the two spheres of existence are no longer divided and the mind, life and body obeying utterly the higher law grow into the spirit's freedom; free from the lower or ignorant response to the cosmic touches, their struggle and their subjection to the duality ceases. This does not mean insensibility to the subjection and struggles and sufferings of others, but it does mean a spiritual supremacy and freedom which enables one to understand perfectly, put the right values on things and heal from above instead of struggling from below. It does not inhibit the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine compassion</span> and helpfulness, but it does inhibit the human and animal sorrow and suffering.\n\nThe link between the spiritual and the lower planes of the being is that which is called in the old Vedantic phraseology the *vijñāna* and which we may describe in our modern turn of language as the Truth-plane or the ideal mind or supermind. There the One and the Many meet and our being is freely open to the revealing light of the divine Truth and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> and Knowledge. If we can break down the veil of the intellectual, emotional, sensational mind which our ordinary existence has built between us and the Divine, we can then take up through the Truth-mind all our mental, vital and physical experience and offer it up to the spiritual—this was the secret or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> sense of the old Vedic \"sacrifice\"—to be converted into the terms of the infinite truth of Sachchidananda, and we can receive the powers and illuminations of the infinite Existence in forms of a divine knowledge, will and delight to be imposed on our mentality, vitality, physical existence till the lower members are transformed into the perfect vessel of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher nature</span>. This was the double Vedic movement of the descent and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> in the human creature and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> of the human powers that struggle towards the divine knowledge, power and delight and climb into the godheads, the result of which was the possession of the One, the infinite, the beatific existence, the union with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Immortality</span>. By possession of this ideal plane we<span class='page-number' id='s-417' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.417]</span> break down entirely the opposition of the lower and the higher existence, the false gulf created by the Ignorance between the finite and the Infinite, God and Nature, the One and the Many, open the gates of the Divine, fulfil the individual in the complete harmony of the cosmic consciousness and realise in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic being</span> the epiphany of the transcendent Sachchidananda. And these results, which obtained on the supramental plane itself or beyond, would be the highest perfection of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span>, we can attain to partially, in a very modified way, in a sort of mental figure by awakening into activity on the corresponding plane of the mental nature. We can get a luminous shadow of that perfect harmony and light. But this belongs to another part of our subject; it is the knowledge on which we must found our Yoga of self-perfection.<span class='page-number' id='s-418' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.418]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-cosmic-consciousness","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Oneness","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/oneness","prvt":"The Passive and the Active Brahman","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-passive-and-the-active-brahman","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["oneness"],"t":"Oneness","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When, then, by the withdrawal of the centre of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> from identification with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> has discovered one's true self, discovered the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> of that self with the pure, silent, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span>, discovered in the immutable, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Akshara</span> Brahman, that by which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> escapes from his own personality into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span>, the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of the Path of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span> has been completed.

When on the other hand, having attained to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and the silence and the peace, we resume possession by the cosmic consciousness of the active as well as the silent Brahman and can securely live in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> freedom as well as rest in it, we have completed the second movement of the Path by which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span> of self-knowledge becomes the station of the liberated soul.\n\nThe soul thus possesses itself in the unity of Sachchidananda upon all the manifest planes of its own being. This is the characteristic of the integral knowledge that it unifies all in Sachchidananda because not only is Being one in itself, but it is one everywhere, in all its poises and in every aspect, in its utmost appearance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> as in its utmost appearance of oneness. The traditional knowledge while it admits this truth in<span class='page-number' id='s-419' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.419]</span> theory, yet reasons practically as if the oneness were not equal everywhere or could not be equally realised in all. It finds it in the unmanifest Absolute, but not so much in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span>, finds it purer in the Impersonal than in the Personal, complete in the Nirguna, not so complete in the Saguna, satisfyingly present in the silent and inactive Brahman, not so satisfyingly present in the active. Therefore it places all these other terms of the Absolute below their opposites in the scale of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> and urges their final rejection as if it were indispensable to the utter realisation. The integral knowledge makes no such <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>; it arrives at a different kind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absoluteness</span> in its vision of the unity.

It finds the same absolute oneness in the Purusha and the Prakriti; in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Presence</span> and the works of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> and Knowledge; in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> manifestness of the one Purusha and the constant manifestation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> Purushas; in the inalienable unity of Sachchidananda keeping constantly real to itself its own manifold oneness and in the apparent divisions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> in which oneness is constantly, if secretly real and constantly seeks to be realised. All unity is to it an intense, pure and infinite realisation, all difference an abundant, rich and boundless realisation of the same divine and eternal Being.\n\nThe complete realisation of unity is therefore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the integral knowledge and of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>. To know Sachchidananda one in Himself and one in all His manifestation is the basis of knowledge; to make that vision of oneness real to the consciousness in its status and in its action and to become that by merging the sense of separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> in the sense of unity with the Being and with all beings is its effectuation in Yoga of knowledge; to live, think, feel, will and act in that sense of unity is its effectuation in the individual being and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual life</span>. This realisation of oneness and this practice of oneness in difference is the whole of the Yoga.\n\nSachchidananda is one in Himself in whatever status or<span class='page-number' id='s-420' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.420]</span> whatever plane of existence. We have therefore to make that the basis of all effectuation whether of consciousness or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> or being, whether of knowledge or will or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>. We have, as we have seen, to live in the consciousness of the Absolute transcendent and of the Absolute manifested in all relations, impersonal and manifest as all personalities, beyond all qualities and rich in infinite quality, a silence out of which the eternal Word creates, a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and peace possessing itself in infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. We have to find Him knowing all, sanctioning all, governing all, containing, upholding and informing all as the Purusha and at the same time executing all knowledge, will and formation as Prakriti. We have to see Him as one Existence, Being gathered in itself and Being displayed in all existences; as one Consciousness concentrated in the unity of its existence, extended in universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> and many-centred in innumerable beings; one Force static in its repose of self-gathered consciousness and dynamic in its activity of extended consciousness; one Delight blissfully aware of its featureless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> and blissfully aware of all feature and force and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> as itself; one creative knowledge and governing Will, supramental, originative and determinative of all minds, lives and bodies; one Mind containing all mental beings and constituting all their mental activities; one Life active in all living beings and generative of their vital activities; one substance constituting all forms and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> as the visible and sensible mould in which mind and life manifest and act just as one pure existence is that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> in which all Conscious-Force and Delight exist unified and find themselves variously. For these are the seven principles of the manifest being of Sachchidananda.\n\nThe integral Yoga of knowledge has to recognise the double nature of this manifestation,—for there is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher nature</span> of Sachchidananda in which He is found and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> of mind, life and body in which He is veiled,—and to reconcile and unite the two in the oneness of the illumined realisation. We have not to leave them separate so that we live a sort of double life, spiritual within or above, mental and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> in our active and earthly living; we have to re-view and remould the lower living in the light, force and joy of the higher reality. We have to<span class='page-number' id='s-421' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.421]</span> realise <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> as a sense-created mould of Spirit, a vehicle for all manifestation of the light, force and joy of Sachchidananda in the highest conditions of terrestrial being and activity. We have to see Life as a channel for the infinite Force divine and break the barrier of a sense-created and mind-created farness and division from it so that that divine Power may take possession of and direct and change all our life-activities until our vitality transfigured ceases in the end to be the limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> which now supports mind and body and becomes a figure of the all-blissful conscious-force of Sachchidananda. We have similarly to change our sensational and emotional <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> into a play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Love</span></span> and universal Delight; and we have to surcharge the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> which seeks to know and will in us with the light of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge-Will</span> until it is transformed into a figure of that higher and sublime activity.\n\nThis transformation cannot be complete or really executed without the awakening of the truth-mind which corresponds in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> to the Supermind and is capable of receiving mentally its illuminations. By the opposition of Spirit and Mind without the free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of this intermediate power the two natures, higher and lower, stand divided, and though there may be communication and influence or the catching up of the lower into the higher in a sort of luminous or ecstatic trance, there cannot be a full and perfect transfiguration of the lower nature. We may feel imperfectly by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional mind</span>, we may have a sense by the sense-mind or a conception and perception by the intelligent mind of the Spirit present in Matter and all its forms, the divine Delight present in all emotion and sensation, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Force</span> behind all life-activities; but the lower will still keep its own nature and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> and divide in its action and modify in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> the influence from above. Even when that influence assumes its highest, widest, intensest power, it will be irregular and disorderly in activity and perfectly realised only in calm and stillness; we shall be subject to reactions and periods of obscuration when it is withdrawn from us; we shall be apt to forget it in the stress of ordinary life and its outward touches and the siege of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span> and to be fully possessed of it only<span class='page-number' id='s-422' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.422]</span> when alone with ourselves and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> or else only in moments or periods of a heightened exaltation and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>. For our mentality, a restricted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> moving in a limited field and seizing things by fragments and parcels, is necessarily shifting, restless and mutable; it can find steadiness only by limiting its field of action and fixity only by cessation and repose.\n\nOur direct truth-perceptions on the other hand come from that Supermind,—a Will that knows and a Knowledge that effects,—which creates universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> out of infinity. Its awakening into action brings down, says the Veda, the unrestricted downpour of the rain of heaven,—the full flowing of the seven rivers from a superior sea of light and power and joy. It reveals Sachchidananda. It reveals the Truth behind the scattered and ill-combined suggestions of our mentality and makes each to fall into its place in the unity of the Truth behind; thus it can transform the half-light of our minds into a certain totality of light. It reveals the Will behind all the devious and imperfectly regulated strivings of our mental will and emotional wishes and vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and makes each to fall into its place in the unity of the luminous Will behind; thus it can transform the half-obscure struggle of our life and mind into a certain totality of ordered force. It reveals the delight for which each of our sensations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> is groping and from which they fall back in movements of partially grasped satisfaction or of dissatisfaction, pain, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> or indifference, and makes each take its place in the unity of the universal delight behind; thus it can transform the conflict of our dualised emotions and sensations into a certain totality of serene, yet profound and powerful love and delight. Moreover, revealing the universal action, it shows the truth of being out of which each of its movements arises and to which each progresses, the force of effectuation which each carries with it and the delight of being for which and from which each is born, and it relates all to the universal being, consciousness, force and delight of Sachchidananda. Thus it harmonises for us all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oppositions</span>, divisions, contrarieties of existence and shows us in them the One and the Infinite. Uplifted into this supramental light, pain and pleasure and indifference begin to be converted into joy of<span class='page-number' id='s-423' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.423]</span> the one self-existent Delight; strength and weakness, success and failure turn into powers of the one self-effective Force and Will; truth and error, knowledge and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> change into light of the one infinite self-awareness and universal knowledge; increase of being and diminution of being, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and the overcoming of limitation are transfigured into waves of the one self-realising conscious existence. All our life as well as all our essential being is transformed into the possession of Sachchidananda.\n\nBy way of this integral knowledge we arrive at the unity of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> set before themselves by the three paths of knowledge, works and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span>. Knowledge aims at the realisation of true self-existence; works are directed to the realisation of the divine Conscious-Will which secretly governs all works; devotion yearns for the realisation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss</span> which enjoys as the Lover all beings and all existences,—Sat, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit-Tapas</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. Each therefore aims at possessing Sachchidananda through one or other aspect of his triune <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>. By Knowledge we arrive always at our true, eternal, immutable being, the self-existent which every \"I\" in the universe obscurely represents, and we abrogate difference in the great realisation, So Aham, I am He, while we arrive also at our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> with all other beings.\n\nBut at the same time the integral knowledge gives us the awareness of that infinite existence as the conscious-force which creates and governs the worlds and manifests itself in their works; it reveals the Self-existent in his universal conscious-will as the Lord, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>. It enables us to unite our will with His, to realise His will in the energies of all existences and to perceive the fulfilment of these energies of others as part of our own universal self-fulfilment. Thus it removes the reality of strife and division and opposition and leaves only their appearances. By that knowledge therefore we arrive at the possibility of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine action</span>, a working which is personal to our nature, but impersonal to our being, since it proceeds from That which is beyond our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> and acts only by its universal sanction. We proceed in our works with equality, without bondage to works and their results, in unison with the Highest, in unison with<span class='page-number' id='s-424' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.424]</span> the universal, free from separate responsibility for our acts and therefore unaffected by their reactions. This which we have seen to be the fulfilment of the path of Works becomes thus an annexe and result of the path of Knowledge.\n\nThe integral knowledge again reveals to us the Self-existent as the All-blissful who, as Sachchidananda manifesting the world, manifesting all beings, accepts their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span>, even as He accepts their works of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> and their seekings of knowledge, leans down to them and drawing them to Himself takes all into the joy of His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine being</span>. Knowing Him as our divine Self, we become one with Him, as the lover and beloved become one, in the ecstasy of that embrace. Knowing Him too in all beings, perceiving the glory and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> and joy of the Beloved everywhere, we transform our souls into a passion of universal delight and a wideness and joy of universal love. All this which, as we shall find, is the summit of the path of Devotion, becomes also an annexe and result of the path of Knowledge.\n\nThus by the integral knowledge we unify all things in the One. We take up all the chords of the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>music</span>, strains sweet or discordant, luminous in their suggestion or obscure, powerful or faint, heard or suppressed, and find them all changed and reconciled in the indivisible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of Sachchidananda. The Knowledge brings also the Power and the Joy. \"How shall he be deluded, whence shall he have sorrow who sees everywhere the Oneness?\"<span class='page-number' id='s-425' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.425]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/oneness","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Soul and Nature","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-nature","prvt":"The Cosmic Consciousness","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-cosmic-consciousness","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-soul-and-nature"],"t":"The Soul and Nature","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"This is the result of the integral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> taken in its mass; its work is to gather up the different strands of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> into the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>.

To see things as parts, as incomplete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> is a lower analytic knowledge. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span> is everywhere; it has to be seen and found everywhere. Every finite is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> and has to be known and sensed in its intrinsic infiniteness as well as in its surface finite appearance. But so to know the world, so to perceive and experience it, it is not enough to have an intellectual idea or imagination that so it is; a certain divine vision, divine sense, divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> is needed, an experience of union of ourselves with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of our consciousness. In that experience not only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beyond</span> but all here, not only the totality, the All in its mass, but each thing in the All becomes to us our self, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, the Absolute and Infinite, Sachchidananda. This is the secret of complete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> in God's world, complete satisfaction of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and will, complete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> of the consciousness. It is the supreme experience at which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> and poetry and all the various efforts of subjective and objective knowledge and all desire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to possess and enjoy objects are trying more or less obscurely to arrive; their attempt to seize the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> and properties and qualities of things is only a first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which cannot give the deepest satisfaction unless by seizing them perfectly and absolutely they get the sense of the infinite reality of which these are the outer symbols. To the rational mind and the ordinary sense-experience this may well seem only a poetic fancy or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hallucination</span>; but the absolute satisfaction<span class='page-number' id='s-426' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.426]</span> and sense of illumination which it gives and alone can give is really a proof of its greater validity; we get by that a ray from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span> and the diviner sense into which our subjective being is intended eventually, if we will only allow it, to be transfigured.\n\nWe have seen that this applies to the highest principles of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine Being</span>. Ordinarily, the discriminating mind tells us that only what is beyond all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> is absolute, only the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formless</span> Spirit is infinite, only the timeless, spaceless, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span>, immobile Self in its repose is absolutely real; and if we follow and are governed in our endeavour by this conception, that is the subjective experience at which we shall arrive, all else seeming to us false or only relatively true. But if we start from the larger conception, a completer truth and a wider experience open to us. We perceive that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutability</span> of the timeless, spaceless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> is an absolute and an infinite, but that also the conscious-force and the active delight of the divine Being in its all-blissful possession of the outpouring of its powers, qualities, self-creations is an absolute and an infinite,—and indeed the same absolute and infinite, so much the same that we can enjoy simultaneously, equally the divine timeless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and peace and the divine time-possessing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, freely, infinitely, without bondage or the lapse into unrest and suffering. So too we can have the same experience of all the principles of this activity which in the Immutable are self-contained and in a sense drawn in and concealed, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> are expressed and realise their infinite quality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>.\n\nThe first of these principles in importance is the duality—which resolves itself into a unity—of Purusha and Prakriti of which we have had occasion to speak in the Yoga of Works, but which is of equal importance for the Yoga of Knowledge. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> was made most clearly by the old Indian philosophies; but it bases itself upon the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of practical duality in unity upon which the world-manifestation is founded. It is given different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> according to our view of the universe. The Vedantins spoke of the Self and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>, meaning according to their predilections by the Self the Immutable and by Maya<span class='page-number' id='s-427' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.427]</span> the power the Self has of imposing on itself the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span></span>, or by the Self the Divine Being and by Maya the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of conscious-being and the conscious-force by which the Divine embodies himself in soul-forms and forms of things. Others spoke of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> and Shakti, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> and His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, His cosmic power. The analytic philosophy of the Sankhyas affirmed their eternal duality without any possibility of oneness, accepting only relations of union and separation by which the cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of Prakriti begins, proceeds or ceases for the Purusha; for the Purusha is an inactive conscious existence,—it is the Soul the same in itself and immutable forever,—Prakriti the active force of Nature which by its motion creates and maintains and by its sinking into rest dissolves the phenomenon of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>. Leaving aside these philosophical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span>, we come to the original psychological experience from which all really take their start, that there are two elements in the existence of living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, of human beings at least if not of all cosmos,—a dual being, Nature and the soul.\n\nThis duality is self-evident. Without any philosophy at all, by the mere force of experience it is what we can all perceive, although we may not take the trouble to define. Even the most thoroughgoing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span> which denies the soul or resolves it into a more or less illusory result of natural phenomena acting upon some ill-explained phenomenon of the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> consciousness or the mind, but which is really no more than a sort of complexity of nervous spasms, cannot get rid of the practical fact of this duality. It does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> at all how it came about; the fact is not only there, it determines our whole existence, it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> fact which is really important to us as human beings with a will and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> and a subjective existence which makes all our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> and our suffering. The whole problem of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> resolves itself into this one question,—\"What are we to do with this soul and nature set face to face with each other,—we who have as one side of our existence this Nature, this personal and cosmic activity, which tries to impress itself upon the soul, to possess, control, determine it, and as the other side this soul which feels that in some mysterious way it has<span class='page-number' id='s-428' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.428]</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, a control over itself, a responsibility for what it is and does, and tries therefore to turn upon Nature, its own and the world's, and to control, possess, enjoy, or even, it may be, reject and escape from her?\" In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to answer that question we have to know,—to know what the soul can do, to know what it can do with itself, to know too what it can do with Nature and the world. The whole of human philosophy, religion, science is really nothing but an attempt to get at the right data upon which it will be possible to answer the question and solve, as satisfactorily as our knowledge will allow, the problem of our existence.\n\nThe hope of a complete escape from our present strife with and subjection to our lower and troubled nature and existence arises when we perceive what religion and philosophy affirm, but modern thought has tried to deny, that there are two poises of our soul-existence, a lower, troubled and subjected, a higher, supreme, untroubled and sovereign, one vibrant in Mind, the other tranquil in Spirit. The hope not only of an escape, but of a completely satisfying and victorious solution comes when we perceive what some religions and philosophies affirm, but others seem to deny, that there is also in the dual unity of soul and nature a lower, an ordinary human status and a higher, a divine; for it is in the divine alone that the conditions of the duality stand reversed; there the soul becomes that which now it only struggles and aspires to be, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of its nature, free and by union with the Divine possessor also of the world-nature. According to our idea of these possibilities will be the solution we shall attempt to realise.\n\nInvolved in mind, possessed by the ordinary phenomenon of mental thought, sensation, emotion, reception of the vital and physical impacts of the world and mechanical reaction to them, the soul is subject to Nature. Even its will and intelligence are determined by its mental nature, determined even more largely by the mental nature of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> which acts upon, subtly as well as overtly, and overcomes the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. Thus its attempt to regulate, to control, to determine its own experience and action is pursued by an element of illusion, since when it thinks it is acting, it is really Nature that is acting and<span class='page-number' id='s-429' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.429]</span> determining all it thinks, wills and does. If there were not this constant knowledge in it that it is, that it exists in itself, is not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> or life but something other which at least receives and accepts the cosmic experience if it does not determine it, it would be compelled in the end to suppose that Nature is all and the soul an illusion. This is the conclusion modern Materialism affirms and to that nihilistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddhism</span> arrived; the Sankhyas, perceiving the dilemma, solved it by saying that the soul in fact only mirrors Nature's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>determinations</span> and itself determines nothing, is not the lord, but can by refusing to mirror them fall back into eternal immobility and peace. There are too the other solutions which arrive at the same practical conclusion, but from the other end, the spiritual; for they affirm either that Nature is an illusion or that both the soul and Nature are impermanent and they point us to a state beyond in which their duality has no existence; either they cease by the extinction of both in something permanent and ineffable or their discordances end by the exclusion of the active principle altogether. Though they do not satisfy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>'s larger hope and deep-seated impulse and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, these are valid solutions so far as they go; for they arrive at an Absolute in itself or at the separate absolute of the soul, even if they reject the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> rapturous infinities of the Absolute which the true possession of Nature by the soul in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span> offers to the eternal seeker in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>.\n\nUplifted into the Spirit the soul is no longer subject to Nature; it is above this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental activity</span>. It may be above it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span> and aloofness, *udāsīna*, seated above and indifferent, or attracted by and lost in the absorbing peace or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of its undifferentiated, its concentrated spiritual experience of itself; we must then transcend by a complete renunciation of Nature and cosmic existence, not conquer by a divine and sovereign possession. But the Spirit, the Divine is not only above Nature; it is master of Nature and cosmos; the soul rising into its spiritual poise must at least be capable of the same mastery by its unity with the Divine. It must be capable of controlling its own nature not only in calm or by forcing it to repose, but with a sovereign control of its play and activity.<span class='page-number' id='s-430' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.430]</span>\n\nTo arrive by an intense spirituality at the absolute of the soul is our possibility on one side of our dual existence; to enjoy the absolute of Nature and of everything in Nature is our possibility on the other side of this eternal duality. To unify these highest aspirations in a divine possession of God and ourselves and the world, should be our happy completeness. In the lower poise this is not possible because the soul acts through the mind and the mind can only act individually and fragmentarily in a contented <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> or a struggling subjection to that universal Nature through which the divine knowledge and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Will</span> are worked out in the cosmos. But the Spirit is in possession of knowledge and will, of which it is the source and cause and not a subject; therefore in proportion as the soul assumes its divine or spiritual being, it assumes also control of the movements of its nature. It becomes, in the ancient language, Swarat, free and a self-ruler over the kingdom of its own life and being. But also it increases in control over its environment, its world.\n\nThis it can only do entirely by universalising itself; for it is the divine and universal will that it must express in its action upon the world. It must first extend its consciousness and see the universe in itself instead of being like the mind limited by the physical, vital, sensational, emotional, intellectual outlook of the little divided personality. It must accept the world-truths, the world-energies, the world-tendencies, the world-purposes as its own instead of clinging to its own intellectual ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and endeavours, preferences, objects, intentions, impulses; these, so far as they remain, must be harmonised with the universal. It must then submit its knowledge and will at their very source to the divine Knowledge and the divine Will and so arrive through submission at immergence, losing its personal light in the divine Light and its personal initiative in the divine initiative. To be first in tune with the Infinite, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with the Divine, and then to be unified with the Infinite, taken into the Divine is its condition of perfect strength and mastery, and this is precisely the very nature of the spiritual life and the spiritual existence.\n\nThe distinction made in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span> between the Purusha and the Prakriti gives us the clue to the various attitudes which the<span class='page-number' id='s-431' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.431]</span> soul can adopt towards Nature in its movement towards perfect freedom and rule. The Purusha is, says the Gita, witness, upholder, source of the sanction, knower, lord, enjoyer; Prakriti executes, it is the active principle and must have an operation corresponding to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the Purusha. The soul may assume, if it wishes, the poise of the pure witness, *sākṣī*; it may look on at the action of Nature as a thing from which it stands apart; it watches, but does not itself participate. We have seen the importance of this quietistic capacity; it is the basis of the movement of withdrawal by which we can say of everything,—body, life, mental action, thought, sensation, emotion,—\"This is Prakriti working in the life, mind and body, it is not myself, it is not even mine,\" and thus come to the soul's separation from these things and to their quiescence. This may, therefore, be an attitude of renunciation or at least of non-participation, tamasic, with a resigned and inert <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span> of the natural action so long as it lasts, rajasic, with a disgust, aversion and recoil from it, sattwic, with a luminous intelligence of the soul's separateness and the peace and joy of aloofness and repose; but also it may be attended by an equal and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> delight as of a spectator at a show, joyous but unattached and ready to rise up at any moment and as joyfully depart. The attitude of the Witness at its highest is the absolute of unattachment and freedom from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> by the phenomena of the cosmic existence.\n\nAs the pure Witness, the soul refuses the function of upholder or sustainer of Nature. The upholder, *bhartā*, is another, God or Force or Maya, but not the soul, which only admits the reflection of the natural action upon its watching consciousness, but not any responsibility for maintaining or continuing it. It does not say \"All this is in me and maintained by me, an activity of my being,\" but at the most \"This is imposed on me, but really external to myself.\" Unless there is a clear and real duality in existence, this cannot be the whole truth of the matter; the soul is the upholder also, it supports in its being the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> which unrolls the spectacle of the cosmos and which conducts its energies. When the Purusha accepts this upholding, it may do it still passively and without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span>, feeling that<span class='page-number' id='s-432' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.432]</span> it contributes the energy, but not that it controls and determines it. The control is another, God or Force or the very nature of Maya; the soul only upholds indifferently so long as it must, so long perhaps as the force of its past sanction and interest in the energy continues and refuses to be exhausted. But if the attitude of the upholder is fully accepted, an important step forward has been taken towards identification with the active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> and his joy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic being</span>. For the Purusha has become the active giver of the sanction.\n\nIn the attitude of the Witness there is also a kind of sanction, but it is passive, inert and has no kind of absoluteness about it; but if he consents entirely to uphold, the sanction has become active, even though the soul may do no more than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to reflect, support and thereby maintain in action all the energies of Prakriti. It may refuse to determine, to select, believing that it is God or Force itself or some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge-Will</span> that selects and determines, and the soul only a witness and upholder and thereby giver of the sanction, *anumantā*, but not the possessor and the director of the knowledge and the will, *jñātā īśvaraḥ*. Then there is a general sanction in the form of an active upholding of whatever is determined by God or universal Will, but there is not an active determination. But if the soul habitually selects and rejects in what is offered to it, it determines; the relatively passive has become an entirely active sanction and is on the way to be an active control.\n\nThis it becomes when the soul accepts its complete function as the knower, lord and enjoyer of Nature. As the knower the soul possesses the knowledge of the force that acts and determines, it sees the values of being which are realising themselves in cosmos, it is in the secret of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span>. For the force that acts is itself determined by the knowledge which is its origin and the source and standardiser of its valuations and effectuations of values. Therefore in proportion as the soul becomes again the knower, it gets the capacity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> also the controller of the action whether by spiritual force alone or by that force figuring itself in mental and physical activities. There may be in our soul life a perfect spiritual knowledge and understanding<span class='page-number' id='s-433' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.433]</span> not only of all our internal activities but of all the unrolling of things, events, human, animal, natural activities around us, the world-vision of the Rishi. This may not be attended by an active putting forth of power upon the world, though that is seldom entirely absent; for the Rishi is not uninterested in the world or in his fellow-creatures, but one with them by sympathy or by accepting all creatures as his own self in many minds and bodies. The old forest-dwelling anchorites even are described continually as busily engaged in doing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> to all creatures. This can only be done in the spiritual realisation, not by an effort, for effort is a diminution of freedom, but by a spiritual influence or by a spiritual mastery over the minds of men and the workings of Nature, which reflects the divine effective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immanence</span> and the divine effective mastery.\n\nNor can it do this without becoming the active enjoyer, *bhoktā*. In the lower being the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> is of a twofold kind, positive and negative, which in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>electricity</span> of sensation translates itself into joy and suffering; but in the higher it is an actively equal enjoyment of the divine delight in self-manifestation. That enjoyment again may be limited to a silent spiritual delight or an integral divine joy possessing all things around us and all activities of all parts of our being.\n\nThere is no loss of freedom, no descent into an ignorant attachment. The man free in his soul is aware that the Divine is the lord of the action of Nature, that Maya is His Knowledge Will determining and effecting all, that Force is the Will side of this double <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> in which knowledge is always present and effectual. He is aware of himself also, even individually, as a centre of the divine existence,—a portion of the Lord, the Gita expresses it,—controlling so far the action of Nature which he views, upholds, sanctions, enjoys, knows and by the determinative power of knowledge controls. And when he universalises himself, his knowledge still reflects only the divine knowledge, his will effectuates only the divine will, he enjoys only the divine delight and not an ignorant personal satisfaction. Thus the Purusha preserves its freedom in its possession, renunciation of limited personality even in its representative enjoyment and<span class='page-number' id='s-434' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.434]</span> delight of cosmic being. It has taken up fully in the higher poise the true relations of the soul and Nature.\n\nPurusha and Prakriti in their union and duality arise from the being of Sachchidananda. Self-conscious existence is the essential nature of the Being; that is Sat or Purusha. The Power of self-aware existence, whether drawn into itself or acting in the works of its consciousness and force, its knowledge and its will, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chit</span> and Tapas, Chit and its Shakti,—that is Prakriti. Delight of being, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, is the eternal truth of the union of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> whether absorbed in itself or else deployed in the inseparable duality of its two aspects. It unrolls the worlds as Prakriti and views them as Purusha; acts in them and upholds the action; executes works and gives the sanction without which the force of Nature cannot act; executes and controls the knowledge and the will and knows and controls the determinations of the knowledge-force and will-force; ministers to the enjoyment and enjoys;—all is the Soul possessor, observer, knower, lord of Nature and Nature expressing the being, executing the will, satisfying the self-knowledge, ministering to the delight of being of the soul. There we have, founded on the very nature of being, the supreme and the universal relation of Prakriti with Purusha. The relation in its imperfect, perverted or reverse terms is the world as we see it; but the perfect relation brings the absolute joy of the soul in itself and, based upon that, the absolute joy of the soul in Nature which is the divine fulfilment of world-existence.<span class='page-number' id='s-435' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.435]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-nature","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Soul and Its Liberation","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-its-liberation","prvt":"Oneness","prvu":"/cwsa/23/oneness","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-soul-and-its-liberation"],"t":"The Soul and Its Liberation","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We have now to pause and consider to what this acceptance of the relations of Purusha and Prakriti commits us; for it means that the Yoga which we are pursuing has for end none of the ordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>.

Therefore to get back to this eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of oneness is our essential act of self-knowledge; to live in it must be the effective principle of our inner possession of our being and of our right and ideal relations with the world. That is why we have had to insist first and foremost on oneness as the aim and in a way the whole aim of our Yoga of knowledge.\n\nBut this unity works itself out everywhere and on every plane by an executive or practical truth of duality. The Eternal is the one infinite conscious Existence, Purusha, and not something inconscient and mechanical; it exists eternally in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> founded in an equilibrium of unity; but it exists also in the no less eternal delight of its force of conscious being at play with various creative self-experience in the universe. Just as we ourselves are or can become aware of being always something timeless, nameless, perpetual which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> our self and which constitutes the unity of all that we are, and yet simultaneously we have the various experience of what we do, think, will, create, become, such too is the self-awareness of this Purusha in the world. Only we, being at present limited and ego-bound mental individuals, have usually this experience in the ignorance and do not live in the self, but only look back at it or draw back to it from time to time, while the Eternal has it in His infinite self-knowledge, is eternally this self and looks from the fullness of self-being at all this self-experience. He does not like us, bound prisoners of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, conceive of His being as either a sort of indefinite result and sum or else a high contradiction of self-experience. The old philosophical quarrel between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Being and Becoming</span> is not possible to the eternal self-knowledge.\n\nAn active force of conscious-being which realises itself in its powers of self-experience, its powers of knowledge, will, self-delight, self-formulation with all their marvellous variations, inversions, conservations and conversions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, even<span class='page-number' id='s-437' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.437]</span> perversions, is what we call Prakriti or Nature, in ourselves as in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>. But behind this force of variation is the eternal equilibrium of the same force in an equal unity which supports impartially, governs even as it has originated the variations and directs them to whatever aim of its self-delight the Being, the Purusha, has conceived in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and determined by its will or power of consciousness. That is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span> into unity with which we have to get back by our Yoga of self-knowledge. We have to become the Purusha, Sachchidananda, delighting in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span></span> possession of its Prakriti and no longer mental beings subject to our egoistic nature. For that is the real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, the supreme and integral self of the individual, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> is only a lower and partial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of ourselves through which a certain limited and preparatory experience becomes possible and is for a time indulged. But this indulgence of the lower being is not our whole possibility; it is not the sole or crowning experience for which we exist as human beings even in this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'><span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> world</span>.\n\nThis individual being of ours is that by which ignorance is possible to self-conscious mind, but it is also that by which liberation into the spiritual being is possible and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. It is not the Eternal in His transcendence or in His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic being</span> who arrives at this immortality; it is the individual who rises into self-knowledge, in him it is possessed and by him it is made effective. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, spiritual, mental or material, is the play of the soul with the possibilities of its nature; for without this play there can be no self-expression and no relative self-experience. Even, then, in our realisation of all as our larger self and in our oneness with God and other beings, this play can and must persist, unless we desire to cease from all self-expression and all but a tranced and absorbed self-experience. But then it is in the individual being that this trance or this liberated play is realised; the trance is this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>'s immersion in the sole experience of unity, the liberated play is the taking up of his mind into the spiritual being for the free realisation and delight of oneness. For the nature of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span> is to possess always its unity, but to possess it also in<span class='page-number' id='s-438' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.438]</span> an infinite experience, from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> standpoints, on many planes, through many conscious powers or selves of itself, individualities—in our limited intellectual language—of the one conscious being. Each one of us is one of these individualities. To stand away from God in limited ego, limited mind is to stand away from ourselves, to be unpossessed of our true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, to be the apparent and not the real individual; it is our power of ignorance. To be taken up into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Being</span> and be aware of our spiritual, infinite and universal consciousness as that in which we now live, is to possess our supreme and integral self, our true individuality; it is our power of self-knowledge.\n\nBy knowing the eternal unity of these three powers of the eternal manifestation, God, Nature and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual self</span>, and their intimate necessity to each other, we come to understand existence itself and all that in the appearances of the world now puzzles our ignorance. Our self-knowledge abolishes none of these things, it abolishes only our ignorance and those circumstances proper to the ignorance which made us bound and subject to the egoistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>determinations</span> of our nature. When we get back to our true being, the ego falls away from us; its place is taken by our supreme and integral self, the true individuality. As this supreme self it makes itself one with all beings and sees all world and Nature in its own infinity. What we mean by this is simply that our sense of separate existence disappears into a consciousness of illimitable, undivided, infinite being in which we no longer feel bound to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>name and form</span> and the particular mental and physical determinations of our present birth and becoming and are no longer separate from anything or anyone in the universe. This was what the ancient thinkers called the Non-birth or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> of birth or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span>. At the same time we continue to live and act through our individual birth and becoming, but with a different knowledge and quite another kind of experience; the world also continues, but we see it in our own being and not as something external to it and other than ourselves. To be able to live permanently in this new consciousness of our real, our integral being is to attain liberation and enjoy immortality.<span class='page-number' id='s-439' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.439]</span>\n\nHere there comes in the complication of the idea that immortality is only possible after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> in other worlds, upon <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span> of existence or that liberation must destroy all possibility of mental or bodily living and annihilate the individual existence for ever in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> infinity. These ideas derive their strength from a certain justification in experience and a sort of necessity or upward attraction felt by the soul when it shakes off the compelling ties of mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>. It is felt that these ties are inseparable from all earthly living or from all mental existence. Death is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>king</span> of the material world, for life seems to exist here only by submission to death, by a constant dying; immortality has to be conquered here with difficulty and seems to be in its nature a rejection of all death and therefore of all birth into the material world. The field of immortality must be in some immaterial plane, in some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> where either the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> does not exist or else is different and only a form of the soul or a secondary circumstance. On the other hand, it is felt by those who would go beyond immortality even, that all planes and heavens are circumstances of the finite existence and the infinite self is void of all these things. They are dominated by a necessity to disappear into the impersonal and infinite and an inability to equate in any way the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of impersonal being with the soul's delight in its becoming. Philosophies have been invented which justify to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> this need of immersion and disappearance; but what is really important and decisive is the call of the Beyond, the need of the soul, its delight—in this case—in a sort of impersonal existence or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>non-existence</span>. For what decides is the determining delight of the Purusha, the relation which it wills to establish with its Prakriti, the experience at which it arrives as the result of the line it has followed in the development of its individual self-experience among all the various possibilities of its nature. Our intellectual justifications are only the account of that experience which we give to the reason and the devices by which we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the mind to assent to the direction in which the soul is moving.\n\nThe cause of our world-existence is not, as our present experience induces us to believe, the ego; for the ego is only a<span class='page-number' id='s-440' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.440]</span> result and a circumstance of our mode of world-existence. It is a relation which the many-souled Purusha has set up between individualised minds and bodies, a relation of self-defence and mutual exclusion and aggression in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to have among all the dependences of things in the world upon each other a possibility of independent mental and physical experience. But there can be no absolute independence upon these planes; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span> which rejects all mental and physical becoming is therefore the only possible culmination of this exclusive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>: so only can an absolutely independent self-experience be achieved. The soul then seems to exist absolutely, independently in itself; it is free in the sense of the Indian word, *svādhīna*, dependent only on itself, not dependent upon God and other beings. Therefore in this experience God, personal self and other beings are all denied, cast away as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> of the ignorance. It is the ego recognising its own insufficiency and abolishing both itself and its contraries that its own essential instinct of independent self-experience may be accomplished; for it finds that its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to achieve it by relations with God and others is afflicted throughout with a sentence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, vanity and nullity. It ceases to admit them because by admitting them it becomes dependent on them; it ceases to admit its own persistence, because the persistence of ego means the admission of that which it tries to exclude as not-self, of the cosmos and other beings. The self-annihilation of the Buddhist is in its nature absolute exclusion of all that the mental being perceives; the self-immersion of the Adwaitin in his absolute being is the self-same aim differently conceived: both are a supreme self-assertion of the soul of its exclusive independence of Prakriti.\n\nThe experience which we first arrive at by the sort of short-cut to liberation which we have described as the movement of withdrawal, assists this tendency. For it is a breaking of the ego and a rejection of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> we now possess; for that is subject to matter and the physical senses and conceives of things only as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, external phenomena and as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> which we attach to those forms. We are not aware directly of the subjective life of other beings except by analogy from our<span class='page-number' id='s-441' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.441]</span> own and by inference or derivative perception based upon their external signs of speech, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, etc., which our minds translate into the terms of our own subjectivity. When we break out from ego and physical mind into the infinity of the spirit, we still see the world and others as the mind has accustomed us to see them, as names and forms; only in our new experience of the direct and superior reality of spirit, they lose that direct objective reality and that indirect subjective reality of their own which they had to the mind. They seem to be quite the opposite of the truer reality we now experience; our mentality, stilled and indifferent, no longer strives to know and make real to itself those intermediate terms which exist in them as in us and the knowledge of which has for its utility to bridge over the gulf between the spiritual self and the objective phenomena of the world. We are satisfied with the blissful infinite impersonality of a pure spiritual existence; nothing else and nobody else any longer matters to us. What the physical senses show to us and what the mind perceives and conceives about them and so imperfectly and transiently delights in, seems now unreal and worthless; we are not and do not care to be in possession of the intermediate truths of being through which these things are enjoyed by the One and possess for Him that value of His being and delight which makes, as we might say, cosmic existence a thing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> to Him and worth manifesting. We can no longer share in God's delight in the world; on the contrary it looks to us as if the Eternal had degraded itself by admitting into the purity of its being the gross nature of Matter or had falsified the truth of its being by imagining vain names and unreal forms. Or else if we perceive at all that delight, it is with a far-off <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>detachment</span> which prevents us from participating in it with any sense of intimate possession, or it is with an attraction to the superior delight of an absorbed and exclusive self-experience which does not allow us to stay any longer in these lower terms than we are compelled to stay by the continuance of our physical life and body.\n\nBut if either in the course of our Yoga or as the result of a free return of our realised Self upon the world and a free repossession of its Prakriti by the Purusha in us, we become<span class='page-number' id='s-442' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.442]</span> conscious not only of the bodies and outward self-expression of others, but intimately of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span>, their minds, their souls and that in them of which their own surface minds are not aware, then we see the real Being in them also and we see them as selves of our Self and not as mere names and forms. They become to us realities of the Eternal. Our minds are no longer subject to the delusion of trivial unworthiness or the illusion of unreality. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material life</span> loses indeed for us its old absorbing value, but finds the greater value which it has for the divine Purusha; regarded no longer as the sole term of our becoming, but as merely having a subordinate value in relation to the higher terms of mind and spirit, it increases by that diminution instead of losing in value. We see that our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material being</span>, life, nature are only one poise of the Purusha in relation to its Prakriti and that their true purpose and importance can only be appreciated when they are seen not as a thing in itself, but as dependent on higher poises by which they are supported; from those superior relations they derive their meaning and, therefore, by conscious union with them they can fulfil all their valid tendencies and aims. Life then becomes justified to us and no longer stultified by the possession of liberated self-knowledge.\n\nThis larger integral knowledge and freedom liberates in the end and fulfils our whole existence. When we possess it, we see why our existence moves between these three terms of God, ourselves and the world; we no longer see them or any of them in opposition to each other, inconsistent, incompatible, nor do we on the other hand regard them as terms of our ignorance which all disappear at last into a pure impersonal unity. We perceive their necessity as terms rather of our self-fulfilment which preserve their value after liberation or rather find then only their real value. We have no longer the experience of our existence as exclusive of the other existences which make up by our relations with them our experience of the world; in this new consciousness they are all contained in ourselves and we in them. They and we are no longer so many mutually exclusive egos each seeking its own independent fulfilment or self-transcendence and ultimately aiming at nothing else; they are all the Eternal and the self in<span class='page-number' id='s-443' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.443]</span> each secretly embraces all in itself and seeks in various ways to make that higher truth of its unity apparent and effective in its terrestrial being. Not mutual exclusiveness, but mutual inclusiveness is the divine truth of our individuality, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> the higher law and not an independent self-fulfilment.\n\nThe Purusha who is our real being is always independent and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of Prakriti and at this independence we are rightly seeking to arrive; that is the utility of the egoistic movement and its self-transcendence, but its right fulfilment is not in making absolute the ego's principle of independent existence, but in arriving at this other highest poise of the Purusha with regard to its Prakriti. There there is transcendence of Nature, but also possession of Nature, perfect fulfilment of our individuality, but also perfect fulfilment of our relations with the world and with others. Therefore an individual salvation in heavens beyond careless of the earth is not our highest objective; the liberation and self-fulfilment of others is as much our own concern,—we might almost say, our divine self-interest,—as our own liberation. Otherwise our unity with others would have no effective meaning. To conquer the lures of egoistic existence in this world is our first victory over ourselves; to conquer the lure of individual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> in heavens beyond is our second victory; to conquer the highest lure of escape from life and a self-absorbed bliss in the impersonal infinity is the last and greatest victory. Then are we rid of all individual exclusiveness and possessed of our entire spiritual freedom.\n\nThe state of the liberated soul is that of the Purusha who is for ever free. Its consciousness is a transcendence and an all-comprehending unity. Its self-knowledge does not get rid of all the terms of self-knowledge, but unifies and harmonises all things in God and in the divine nature. The intense religious ecstasy which knows only God and ourselves and shuts out all else, is only to it an intimate experience which prepares it for sharing in the embrace of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Love</span> and Delight around all creatures. A heavenly bliss which unites God and ourselves and the blest, but enables us to look with a remote indifference on the unblest and their sufferings is not possible to the perfect<span class='page-number' id='s-444' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.444]</span> soul; for these also are its selves; free individually from suffering and ignorance, it must naturally turn to draw them also towards its freedom. On the other hand any absorption in the relations between self and others and the world to the exclusion of God and the Beyond is still more impossible, and therefore it cannot be limited by the earth or even by the highest and most altruistic relations of man with man. Its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> or its culmination is not to efface and utterly deny itself for the sake of others, but to fulfil itself in God-possession, freedom and divine bliss that in and by its fulfilment others too may be fulfilled. For it is in God alone, by the possession of the Divine only that all the discords of life can be resolved, and therefore the raising of men towards the Divine is in the end the one effective way of helping <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>. All the other activities and realisations of our self-experience have their use and power, but in the end these crowded sidetracks or these lonely paths must circle round to converge into the wideness of the integral way by which the liberated soul transcends all, embraces all and becomes the promise and the power of the fulfilment of all in their manifested being of the Divine.<span class='page-number' id='s-445' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.445]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-its-liberation","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Planes of Our Existence","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-planes-of-our-existence","prvt":"The Soul and Nature","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-nature","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-planes-of-our-existence"],"t":"The Planes of Our Existence","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"If the Purusha in us has thus to become by union with its highest self, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> Purusha, the knower, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span>, free enjoyer of its Prakriti, it cannot be done, evidently, by dwelling on the present plane of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>; for that is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> plane in which the reign of Prakriti is complete; there the divine Purusha is entirely hidden in the blinding surge of her activities, in the gross pomp of her workings, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> soul emerging from her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>involution</span> of spirit in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, subject in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> its activities to its entangling in the material and vital instruments is unable to experience the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>.

They indeed rather hamper it, because to live on them brings new attractive psychical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span>, psychical enjoyments, psychical powers, a new world of phenomenal knowledge the pursuit of which creates stumbling-blocks in the way of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> object, immergence in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span>, and brings a succession of innumerable way-side snares on the road which leads to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>. But since we accept world-existence, and for us all world-existence is Brahman and full of the presence of God, these things can have no terrors for us; whatever dangers of distraction there may be, we have to face and overcome them. If the world and our own existence are so complex, we must know and embrace their complexities in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that our self-knowledge and our knowledge of the dealings of Purusha with its Prakriti may be complete. If there are many planes, we have to possess them all for the Divine, even as we seek to possess spiritually and transform our ordinary poise of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>.\n\nThe ancient knowledge in all countries was full of the search after the hidden truths of our being and it created that large field of practice and inquiry which goes in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> by the name of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occultism</span>,—we do not use any corresponding word in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span>, because these things do not seem to us so remote, mysterious and abnormal as to the occidental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>; they are nearer to us and the veil between our normal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material life</span> and this larger life is much thinner. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>,[^1] Egypt, Chaldea, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span>, Greece, the Celtic countries they have formed part of various Yogic systems and disciplines which had once a great hold everywhere, but to the modern mind have seemed mere superstition and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span>, although the facts and experiences on which they are founded are quite as real in their own field and as much governed by intelligible laws of their own as the facts and experiences of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span>. It is not our intention here to plunge into this<span class='page-number' id='s-447' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.447]</span> vast and difficult field of psychical knowledge.[^2] But it becomes necessary now to deal with certain broad facts and principles which form its framework, for without them our Yoga of knowledge cannot be complete. We find that in the various systems the facts dealt with are always the same, but there are considerable differences of theoretic and practical arrangement, as is natural and inevitable in dealing with a subject so large and difficult. Certain things are here omitted, there made all-important, here understressed, there over-emphasised; certain fields of experience which are in one system held to be merely subordinate provinces, are in others treated as separate kingdoms. But I shall follow here consistently the Vedic and Vedantic arrangement of which we find the great lines in the Upanishads, first because it seems to me at once the simplest and most philosophical and more especially because it was from the beginning envisaged from the point of view of the utility of these various planes to the supreme object of our liberation. It takes as its basis the three principles of our ordinary being, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and matter</span>, the triune spiritual principle of Sachchidananda and the link principle of *vijñāna*, supermind, the free or spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>, and thus arranges all the large possible poises of our being in a tier of seven planes,—sometimes regarded as five only, because, only the lower five are wholly accessible to us,—through which the developing being can rise to its perfection.\n\n[^1]: For example, the Tantric in India.\n\n[^2]: We hope to deal with it hereafter; but our first concern in the *Arya* must be with spiritual and philosophical truths; it is only when these have been grasped that the approach to the psychical becomes safe and clear.\n\nBut first we must understand what we mean by planes of consciousness, planes of existence. We mean a general settled poise or world of relations between Purusha and Prakriti, between the Soul and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>. For anything that we can <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> world is and can be nothing else than the working out of a general relation which a universal existence has created or established between itself, or let us say its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> or potentiality and the powers of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span>. That existence in its relations with and its experience of the becoming is what we call soul or Purusha,<span class='page-number' id='s-448' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.448]</span> individual soul in the individual, universal soul in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>; the principle and the powers of the becoming are what we call Nature or Prakriti. But since Being, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span></span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of being are always the three constituent terms of existence, the nature of a world is really determined by the way in which Prakriti is set to deal with these three primary things and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> which it is allowed to give to them. For existence itself is and must always be the stuff of its own becoming; it must be shaped into the substance with which Force has to deal. Force again must be the power which works out that substance and works with it to whatever ends; Force is that which we ordinarily call Nature. Again the end, the object with which the worlds are created must be worked out by the consciousness inherent in all existence and all force and all their workings, and the object must be the possession of itself and of its delight of existence in the world. To that all the circumstances and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of any world-existence must reduce themselves; it is existence developing its terms of being, its power of being, its conscious delight of being; if these are involved, their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>; if they are veiled, their self-revelation.\n\nHere the soul lives in a material universe; of that alone it is immediately conscious; the realisation of its potentialities in that is the problem with which it is concerned. But matter means the involution of the conscious delight of existence in self-oblivious force and in a self-dividing, infinitesimally disaggregated form of substance. Therefore the whole principle and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of a material world must be the evolution of what is involved and the development of what is undeveloped. Here everything is shut up from the first in the violently working inconscient sleep of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material force</span>; therefore the whole aim of any material becoming must be the waking of consciousness out of the inconscient; the whole consummation of a material becoming must be the removal of the veil of matter and the luminous revelation of the entirely self-conscient Being to its own imprisoned soul in the becoming. Since <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Man</span> is such an imprisoned soul, this luminous liberation and coming to self-knowledge must be his highest object and the condition of his perfection.<span class='page-number' id='s-449' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.449]</span>\n\nBut the limitations of a material universe seem to be hostile to the proper accomplishment of this object which is yet so inevitably the highest aim of a mental being born into a physical body. First existence has formed itself here, fundamentally, as Matter; it has been objectivised, made sensible and concrete to its own self-experiencing conscious-force in the form of self-dividing material substance, and by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aggregation</span> of this matter there has been built up for man a physical body separate, divided from others and subject to the fixed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of process or, as we call them, the laws of inconscient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span>. His force of being too is nature or Force working in matter, which has waked slowly out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inconscience</span> to life and is always limited by form, always dependent on the body, always separated by it from the rest of Life and from other living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, always hampered in its development, persistence, self-perfectioning by the laws of the Inconscience and the limitations of bodily living. Equally, his consciousness is a mentality emerging in a body and in a sharply individualised life; it is therefore limited in its workings and capacities and dependent on bodily <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> of no great competence and on a very restricted vital force; it is separated from the rest of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> mind and shut out from the thoughts of other mental beings whose inner workings are a sealed book to man's physical mind except in so far as he can read them by the analogy of his own mentality and by their insufficient bodily signs and self-expressions. His consciousness is always falling back towards the inconscience in which a large part of it is always involved, his life towards <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, his physical being towards dis-aggregation. His delight of being depends on the relations of this imperfect consciousness with its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> based upon physical sensations and the sense-mind, in other words on a limited mind trying to lay hold on a world external and foreign to it by means of a limited body, limited vital force, limited organs. Therefore its power for possession is limited, its force for delight is limited, and every touch of the world which exceeds its force, which that force cannot bear, cannot seize on, cannot assimilate and possess must turn to something else than delight, to pain, discomfort or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span>. Or else it must<span class='page-number' id='s-450' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.450]</span> be met by non-reception, insensibility, or, if received, put away by indifference. Moreover such delight of being as it possesses, is not possessed naturally and eternally like the self-delight of Sachchidananda, but by experience and acquisition in Time, and can therefore only be maintained and prolonged by repetition of experience and is in its nature precarious and transient.\n\nAll this means that the natural relations of Purusha to Prakriti in the material universe are the complete absorption of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious being</span> in the force of its workings, therefore the complete self-oblivion and self-ignorance of the Purusha, the complete domination of Prakriti and subjection of the soul to Nature. The soul does not know itself, it only knows, if anything, the workings of Prakriti. The emergence of the individual self-conscious soul in Man does not of itself abrogate these primary relations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and subjection. For this soul is living on a material plane of existence, a poise of Prakriti in which matter is still the chief determinant of its relations to Nature, and its consciousness being limited by Matter cannot be an entirely self-possessing consciousness. Even the universal soul, if limited by the material formula, could not be in entire possession of itself; much less can the individual soul to which the rest of existence becomes by bodily, vital and mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and separation something external to it on which it is yet dependent for its life and its delight and its knowledge. These limitations of his power, knowledge, life, delight of existence are the whole cause of man's dissatisfaction with himself and the universe. And if the material universe were all and the material plane the only plane of his being, then man the individual Purusha could never arrive at perfection and self-fulfilment or indeed to any other life than that of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span>. There must be either worlds in which he is liberated from these incomplete and unsatisfactory relations of Purusha with Prakriti, or planes of his own being by ascending to which he can transcend them, or at the very least planes, worlds and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher beings</span> from which he can receive or be helped to knowledge, powers, joys, a growth of his being otherwise impossible. All these things, the ancient knowledge asserts, exist,—other worlds, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span>, the possibility of<span class='page-number' id='s-451' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.451]</span> communication, of ascension, of growth by contact with and influence from that which is above him in the present scale of his realised being.\n\nAs there is a poise of the relations of Purusha with Prakriti in which Matter is the first determinant, a world of material existence, so there is another just above it in which Matter is not supreme, but rather <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-force</span> takes its place as the first determinant. In this world forms do not determine the conditions of the life, but it is life which determines the form, and therefore forms are there much more free, fluid, largely and to our conceptions strangely variable than in the material world. This life-force is not inconscient material force, not even, except in its lowest movements, an elemental subconscient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, but a conscious force of being which makes for formation, but much more essentially for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span>, possession, satisfaction of its own dynamic impulse. Desire and the satisfaction of impulse are therefore the first law of this world of sheer vital existence, this poise of relations between the soul and its nature in which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> plays with so much greater a freedom and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> than in our physical living; it may be called the desire-world, for that is its principal characteristic. Moreover, it is not fixed in one hardly variable formula as physical life seems to be, but is capable of many variations of its poise, admits many sub-planes ranging from those which touch material existence and, as it were, melt into that, to those which touch at the height of the life-power the planes of pure mental and psychic existence and melt into them. For in Nature in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> scale of being there are no wide gulfs, no abrupt chasms to be overleaped, but a melting of one thing into another, a subtle continuity; out of that her power of distinctive experience creates the orderings, the definite ranges, the distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> by which the soul variously knows and possesses its possibilities of world-existence. Again, enjoyment of one kind or another being the whole object of desire, that must be the trend of the desire-world; but since wherever the soul is not free,—and it cannot be free when subject to desire,—there must be the negative as well as the positive of all its experience, this world contains not only the possibility of large or intense<span class='page-number' id='s-452' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.452]</span> or continuous enjoyments almost inconceivable to the limited physical mind, but also the possibility of equally enormous sufferings. It is here therefore that there are situated the lowest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> and all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hells</span> with the tradition and imagination of which the human mind has lured and terrified itself since the earliest ages. All human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> indeed correspond to some reality or real possibility, though they may in themselves be a quite inaccurate representation or couched in too physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> and therefore inapt to express the truth of supraphysical realities.\n\nNature being a complex unity and not a collection of unrelated phenomena, there can be no unbridgeable gulf between the material existence and this vital or desire world. On the contrary, they may be said in a sense to exist in each other and are at least interdependent to a certain extent. In fact, the material world is really a sort of projection from the vital, a thing which it has thrown out and separated from itself in order to embody and fulfil some of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> under conditions other than its own, which are yet the logical result of its own most material longings. Life on earth may be said to be the result of the pressure of this life-world on the material, inconscient existence of the physical universe. Our own manifest vital being is also only a surface result of a larger and profounder vital being which has its proper seat on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-plane</span> and through which we are connected with the life-world. Moreover, the life-world is constantly acting upon us and behind everything in material existence there stand appropriate powers of the life-world; even the most crude and elemental have behind them elemental life-powers, elemental beings by which or by whom they are supported. The influences of the life-world are always pouring out on the material existence and producing there their powers and results which return again upon the life-world to modify it. From that the life-part of us, the desire-part is being always touched and influenced; there too are beneficent and malefic powers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> desire and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> desire which concern themselves with us even when we are ignorant of and unconcerned with them. Nor are these powers merely tendencies, inconscient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, nor, except on the verges<span class='page-number' id='s-453' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.453]</span> of Matter, subconscient, but conscious powers, beings, living influences. As we awaken to the higher planes of our existence, we become aware of them as friends or enemies, powers which seek to possess or which we can <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>, overcome, pass <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> and leave behind. It is this possible relation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> with the powers of the life-world which occupied to so large an extent European occultism, especially in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Middle Ages</span>, as well as certain forms of Eastern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> and spiritualism. The \"superstitions\" of the past—much superstition there was, that is to say, much ignorant and distorted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>, false explanations and obscure and clumsy dealing with the laws of the beyond,—had yet behind them truths which a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> Science, delivered from its sole preoccupation with the material world, may rediscover. For the supra-material is as much a reality as the existence of mental beings in the material universe.\n\nBut why then are we not normally aware of so much that is behind us and always pressing upon us? For the same reason that we are not aware of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> of our neighbour, although it exists as much as our own and is constantly exercising an occult influence upon us,—for a great part of our thoughts and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> come into us from outside, from our fellow-men, both from individuals and from the collective mind of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>; and for the same reason that we are not aware of the greater part of our own being which is subconscient or subliminal to our waking mind and is always influencing and in an occult manner determining our surface existence. It is because we use, normally, only our corporeal senses and live almost wholly in the body and the physical vitality and the physical mind, and it is not directly through these that the life-world enters into relations with us. That is done through other sheaths of our being,—so they are termed in the Upanishads,—other bodies, as they are called in a later terminology, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental sheath</span> or subtle body in which our true mental being lives and the life sheath or vital body which is more closely connected with the physical or food-sheath and forms with it the gross body of our complex existence. These possess powers, senses, capacities which are always secretly acting in us, are connected with and impinge upon our physical<span class='page-number' id='s-454' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.454]</span> organs and the plexuses of our physical life and mentality. By self-development we can become aware of them, possess our life in them, get through them into conscious relation with the life-world and other worlds and use them also for a more subtle experience and more intimate knowledge of the truths, facts and happenings of even the material world itself. We can by this self-development live more or less fully on planes of our existence other than the material which is now all in all to us.\n\nWhat has been said of the life-world applies with the necessary differences to still higher planes of the cosmic existence. For beyond that is a mental plane, a world of mental existence in which neither life, nor matter, but mind is the first determinant. Mind there is not determined by material conditions or by the life-force, but itself determines and uses them for its own satisfaction. There mind, that is to say, the psychical and the intellectual being, is free in a certain sense, free at least to satisfy and fulfil itself in a way hardly conceivable to our body-bound and life-bound mentality; for the Purusha there is the pure mental being and his relations with Prakriti are determined by that purer mentality, Nature there is mental rather than vital and physical. Both the life-world and indirectly the material are a projection from that, the result of certain tendencies of the mental Being which have sought a field, conditions, an arrangement of harmonies proper to themselves; and the phenomena of mind in this world may be said to be a result of the pressure of that plane first on the life-world and then on life in the material existence. By its modification in the life-world it creates in us the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-mind</span>; in its own right it awakes in us the purer powers of our psychical and intellectual existence. But our surface mentality is only a secondary result of a larger subliminal mentality whose proper seat is the mental plane. This world of mental existence also is constantly acting upon us and our world, has its powers and its beings, is related to us through our mental body. There we find the psychical and mental heavens to which the Purusha can ascend when it drops this physical body and can there sojourn till the impulse to terrestrial existence again draws it downward. Here too are many planes, the lowest<span class='page-number' id='s-455' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.455]</span> converging upon and melting into the worlds below, the highest at the heights of the mind-power into the worlds of a more spiritual existence.\n\nThese highest worlds are therefore supramental; they belong to the principle of supermind, the free, spiritual or divine intelligence[^3] or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span> and to the triple spiritual principle of Sachchidananda. From them the lower worlds derive by a sort of fall of the Purusha into certain specific or narrow conditions of the play of the soul with its nature. But these also are divided from us by no unbridgeable gulf; they affect us through what are called the knowledge-sheath and the bliss-sheath, through the causal or spiritual body, and less directly through the mental body, nor are their secret powers absent from the workings of the vital and material existence. Our conscious spiritual being and our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> awaken in us as a result of the pressure of these highest worlds on the mental being in life and body. But this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>causal body</span> is, as we may say, little developed in the majority of men and to live in it or to ascend to the supramental planes, as distinguished from corresponding sub-planes in the mental being, or still more to dwell consciously upon them is the most difficult thing of all for the human being. It can be done in the trance of Samadhi, but otherwise only by a new evolution of the capacities of the individual Purusha of which few are even willing to conceive. Yet is that the condition of the perfect self-consciousness by which alone the Purusha can possess the full conscious control of Prakriti; for there not even the mind determines, but the Spirit freely uses the lower differentiating principles as minor terms of its existence governed by the higher and reaching by them their own perfect capacity. That alone would be the perfect evolution of the involved and development of the undeveloped for which the Purusha has sought in the material universe, as if in a wager with itself, the conditions of the greatest difficulty.<span class='page-number' id='s-456' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.456]</span>\n\n[^3]: Called the *vijñāna* or *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>buddhi</span>*, a word which may lead to some misunderstanding as it is also applied to the mental intelligence which is only a lower derivation from the divine gnosis.","url":"/cwsa/23/the-planes-of-our-existence","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Lower Triple Purusha","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-lower-triple-purusha","prvt":"The Soul and Its Liberation","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-soul-and-its-liberation","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-lower-triple-purusha"],"t":"The Lower Triple Purusha","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Such is the constituent principle of the various worlds of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and the various planes of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>; they are as if a ladder plunging down into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Matter</span> and perhaps below it, rising up into the heights of the Spirit, even perhaps to the point at which existence escapes out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic being</span> into ranges of a supra-cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Absolute</span>,—so at least it is averred in the world-system of the Buddhists.

Our own being is a sort of accident or at least a very small and minor circumstance in the universal life of Matter or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> continuity of the workings of material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Force</span>.

Science gives us the objective truth of existence and the superficial knowledge of our physical and vital being; but we feel that there are truths beyond which possibly through the cultivation of our subjective being and the enlargement of its powers may come to lie more and more open to us. When the knowledge of this world is ours, we are irresistibly impelled to seek for the knowledge of other states of existence beyond, and that is the reason why an age of strong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span> and scepticism is always followed by an age of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occultism</span>, of mystical creeds, of new religions and profounder seekings after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span>. The knowledge of our superficial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> and the laws of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bodily life</span> is not enough; it brings us always to all that mysterious and hidden depth of subjective existence below and behind of which our surface consciousness is only a fringe or an outer court. We come to see that what is present to our physical senses is only the material shell of cosmic existence and what is obvious in our superficial mentality is only the margin of immense continents which lie behind unexplored. To explore them must be the work of another knowledge than that of physical science or of a superficial psychology.\n\nReligion is the first attempt of man to get beyond himself and beyond the obvious and material facts of his existence. Its first essential work is to confirm and make real to him his subjective sense of an Infinite on which his material and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> depends and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of his soul to come into its presence and live in contact with it. Its function is to assure<span class='page-number' id='s-458' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.458]</span> him too of that possibility of which he has always dreamed, but of which his ordinary life gives him no assurance, the possibility of transcending himself and growing out of bodily life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mortality</span> into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of immortal life and spiritual existence. It also confirms in him the sense that there are worlds or planes of existence other than that in which his lot is now cast, worlds in which this mortality and this subjection to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> and suffering are not the natural state, but rather <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of immortality is the eternal condition. Incidentally, it gives him a rule of mortal life by which he shall prepare himself for immortality. He is a soul and not a body and his earthly life is a means by which he determines the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> conditions of his spiritual being. So much is common to all religions; beyond this we get from them no assured certainty. Their voices vary; some tell us that one life on earth is all we have in which to determine our future existence, deny the past immortality of the soul and assert only its future immortality, threaten it even with the incredible dogma of a future of eternal suffering for those who miss the right path, while others more large and rational affirm successive existences by which the soul grows into the knowledge of the Infinite with a complete assurance for all of ultimate arrival and perfection. Some present the Infinite to us as a Being other than ourselves with whom we can have personal relations, others as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonal</span> existence into which our separate being has to merge; some therefore give us as our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> worlds beyond in which we dwell in the presence of the Divine, others a cessation of world-existence by immergence in the Infinite. Most invite us to bear or to abandon earthly life as a trial or a temporary affliction or a vanity and fix our hopes beyond; in some we find a vague hint of a future triumph of the Spirit, the Divine in the body, upon this earth, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective life</span> of man, and so justify not only the separate hope and aspiration of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> but the united and sympathetic hope and aspiration of the race. Religion in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> is not knowledge, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and aspiration; it is justified indeed both by an imprecise intuitive knowledge of large spiritual truths and by the subjective experience of souls that have risen beyond the ordinary life, but in itself it only gives us the hope and faith by which we may be<span class='page-number' id='s-459' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.459]</span> induced to aspire to the intimate possession of the hidden tracts and larger realities of the Spirit. That we turn always the few distinct truths and the symbols or the particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of a religion into hard and fast dogmas, is a sign that as yet we are only infants in the spiritual knowledge and are yet far from the science of the Infinite.\n\nYet behind every great religion, behind, that is to say, its exoteric side of faith, hope, symbols, scattered truths and limiting dogmas, there is an esoteric side of inner spiritual training and illumination by which the hidden truths may be known, worked out, possessed. Behind every exoteric religion there is an esoteric Yoga, an intuitive knowledge to which its faith is the first step, inexpressible realities of which its symbols are the figured <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, a deeper sense for its scattered truths, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysteries</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span> of existence of which even its dogmas and superstitions are crude hints and indications. What Science does for our knowledge of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span>, replacing first appearances and uses by the hidden truths and as yet <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occult powers</span> of its great natural forces and in our own minds beliefs and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> by verified experience and a profounder understanding, Yoga does for the higher planes and worlds and possibilities of our being which are aimed at by the religions. Therefore all this mass of graded experience existing behind closed doors to which the consciousness of man may find, if it wills, the key, falls within the province of a comprehensive Yoga of knowledge, which need not be confined to the seeking after the Absolute alone or the knowledge of the Divine in itself or of the Divine only in its isolated relations with the individual human soul. It is true that the consciousness of the Absolute is the highest reach of the Yoga of knowledge and that the possession of the Divine is its first, greatest and most ardent object and that to neglect it for an inferior knowledge is to afflict our Yoga with inferiority or even frivolity and to miss or fall away from its characteristic object; but, the Divine in itself being known, the Yoga of knowledge may well embrace also the knowledge of the Divine in its relations with ourselves and the world on the different planes of our existence. To rise to the pure Self being<span class='page-number' id='s-460' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.460]</span> steadfastly held to as the summit of our subjective self-uplifting, we may from that height possess our lower selves even to the physical and the workings of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> which belong to them.\n\nWe may seek this knowledge on two sides separately, the side of Purusha, the side of Prakriti; and we may combine the two for the perfect possession of the various relations of Purusha and Prakriti in the light of the Divine. There is, says the Upanishad, a fivefold soul in man and the world, the microcosm and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>macrocosm</span>. The physical soul, self or being,—Purusha, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>,—is that of which we are all at first conscious, a self which seems to have hardly any existence apart from the body and no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> vital or even mental independent of it. This physical soul is present everywhere in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material Nature</span>; it pervades the body, actuates obscurely its movements and is the whole basis of its experiences; it informs all things even that are not mentally conscious. But in man this physical being has become vitalised and mentalised; it has received something of the law and capacities of the vital and mental being and nature. But its possession of them is derivative, superimposed, as it were, on its original nature and exercised under subjection to the law and action of the physical existence and its instruments. It is this dominance of our mental and vital parts by the body and the physical nature which seems at first sight to justify the theory of the materialists that mind and life are only circumstances and results of physical force and all their operations explicable by the activities of that force in the animal body. In fact entire subjection of the mind and the life to the body is the characteristic of an undeveloped <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>, as it is in an even greater degree of the infra-human animal. According to the theory of reincarnation those who do not get beyond this stage in the earthly life, cannot rise after death to the mental or higher vital worlds, but have to return from the confines of a series of physical planes to increase their development in the next earthly existence. For the undeveloped physical soul is entirely dominated by material nature and its impressions and has to work them out to a better advantage before it can rise in the scale of being.\n\nA more developed humanity allows us to make a better and<span class='page-number' id='s-461' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.461]</span> freer use of all the capacities and experiences that we derive from the vital and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental planes</span> of being, to lean more for support upon these hidden planes, be less absorbed by the physical and to govern and modify the original nature of the physical being by greater vital forces and powers from the desire-world and greater and subtler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental forces</span> and powers from the psychical and intellectual planes. By this development we are able to rise to higher altitudes of the intermediary existence between death and rebirth and to make a better and more rapid use of rebirth itself for a yet higher mental and spiritual development. But even so, in the physical being which still determines the greater part of our waking self, we act without definite consciousness of the worlds or planes which are the sources of our action. We are aware indeed of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-plane</span> and mind-plane of the physical being, but not of the life-plane and mind-plane proper or of the superior and larger vital and mental being which we are behind the veil of our ordinary consciousness. It is only at a high stage of development that we become aware of them and even then, ordinarily, only at the back of the action of our mentalised physical nature; we do not actually live on those planes, for if we did we could very soon arrive at the conscious control of the body by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> and of both by the sovereign mind; we should then be able to determine our physical and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental life</span> to a very large extent by our will and knowledge as masters of our being and with a direct action of the mind on the life and body. By Yoga this power of transcending the physical self and taking possession of the higher selves may to a greater or less degree be acquired through a heightened and widened self-consciousness and self-mastery.\n\nThis may be done, on the side of Purusha, by drawing back from the physical self and its preoccupation with physical nature and through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> of thought and will raising oneself into the vital and then into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental self</span>. By doing so we can become the vital being and draw up the physical self into that new consciousness so that we are only aware of the body, its nature and its actions as secondary circumstances of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-soul</span> which we now are, used by it for its relations with the<span class='page-number' id='s-462' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.462]</span> material world. A certain remoteness from physical being and then a superiority to it; a vivid sense of the body being a mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> or shell and easily detachable; an extraordinary effectivity of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> on our physical being and life-environment; a great sense of power and ease in manipulating and directing the vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of which we now become vividly conscious, for its action is felt by us concretely, subtly physical in relation to the body, sensible in a sort of subtle density as an energy used by the mind; an awareness of the life-plane in us above the physical and knowledge and contact with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> of the desire-world; a coming into action of new powers,—what are usually called occult powers or siddhis; a close sense of and sympathy with the Life-soul in the world and a knowledge or sensation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, desires, vital impulses of others; these are some of the signs of this new consciousness gained by Yoga.\n\nBut all this belongs to the inferior grades of spiritual experience and indeed is hardly more spiritual than the physical existence. We have in the same way to go yet higher and raise ourselves into the mental self. By doing so we can become the mental self and draw up the physical and vital being into it, so that life and body and their operations become to us minor circumstances of our being used by the Mind-soul which we now are for the execution of its lower purposes that belong to the material existence. Here too we acquire at first a certain remoteness from the life and the body and our real life seems to be on quite another plane than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material man</span>'s, in contact with a subtler existence, a greater light of knowledge than the terrestrial, a far rarer and yet more sovereign energy; we are in touch in fact with the mental plane, aware of the mental worlds, can be in communication with its beings and powers. From that plane we behold the desire-world and the material existence as if below us, things that we can cast away from us if we will and in fact easily reject when we relinquish the body, so as to dwell in the mental or psychical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span>. But we can also, instead of being thus remote and detached, become rather superior to the life and body and the vital and material planes and act upon them with mastery from our new height of being. Another sort<span class='page-number' id='s-463' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.463]</span> of dynamis than physical or vital energy, something that we may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> pure mind-power and soul-force, which the developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> uses indeed but derivatively and imperfectly, but which we can now use freely and with knowledge, becomes the ordinary process of our action, while desire-force and physical action fall into a secondary place and are only used with this new energy behind them and as its occasional channels. We are in touch and sympathy also with the Mind in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmos</span>, conscious of it, aware of the intentions, directions, thought-forces, struggle of subtle powers behind all happenings, which the ordinary man is ignorant of or can only obscurely infer from the physical happening, but which we can now see and feel directly before there is any physical sign or even vital intimation of their working. We acquire too the knowledge and sense of the mind-action of other beings whether on the physical plane or on those above it; and the higher capacities of the mental being,—occult powers or siddhis, but of a much rarer or subtler kind than those proper to the vital plane,—naturally awake in our consciousness.\n\nAll these however are circumstances of the lower triple world of our being, the *trailokya* of the ancient sages. Living on these we are, whatever the enlargement of our powers and our consciousness, still living within the limits of the cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> and subject, though with a much subtler, easier and modified subjection, to the reign of Prakriti over Purusha. To achieve real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and mastery we have to ascend to a yet higher level of the many-plateaued mountain of our being.<span class='page-number' id='s-464' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.464]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-lower-triple-purusha","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"The Ladder of Self-Transcendence","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/the-ladder-of-self-transcendence","prvt":"The Planes of Our Existence","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-planes-of-our-existence","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-ladder-of-self-transcendence"],"t":"The Ladder of Self-Transcendence","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The transcendence of this lower triple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> and this lower triple world, to which ordinarily our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and its powers and results are limited,—a transcendence described by the Vedic seers as an exceeding or breaking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the two firmaments of heaven and earth,—opens out a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hierarchy</span> of infinitudes to which the normal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> even in its highest and widest flights is still a stranger.

We can indeed become aware of the true Self or Spirit in ourselves by turning our sense and vision inward; we can discover too the same Self or Spirit in the external world and its phenomena by plunging them there also inward through the veil of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span><span class='page-number' id='s-465' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.465]</span> and forms to that which dwells in these or else stands behind them.

But we can only to a very limited extent share in its active or dynamic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of knowledge, power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>.

To understand the possibility of transcending it at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, we must restate in a practical formula the relations of the worlds which constitute the two hemispheres.\n\nAll is determined by the Spirit, for all from subtlest existence to grossest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> is manifestation of the Spirit.

Poised in the principle of Matter, it becomes the physical self of a physical universe in the reign of a physical Nature. Spirit is then absorbed in its experience of Matter; it is dominated by the ignorance and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> of the tamasic Power proper to physical existence. In the individual it becomes a materialised soul, *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>annamaya puruṣa</span>*, whose life and mind have developed out of the ignorance and inertia of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> principle and are subject to their fundamental limitations. For life in Matter works in dependence on the body; mind in Matter works in dependence on the body and on the vital or nervous being; spirit itself in Matter is limited and divided in its self-relation and its powers by the limitations and divisions of this matter-governed and life-driven mind. This materialised soul lives bound to the physical body and its narrow superficial external consciousness, and it takes normally the experiences of its physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>, its senses, its matter-bound life and mind, with at most some limited spiritual glimpses, as the whole truth of existence.<span class='page-number' id='s-466' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.466]</span>\n\nMan is a spirit, but a spirit that lives as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> in physical Nature; he is to his own self-consciousness a mind in a physical body. But at first he is this mental being materialised and he takes the materialised soul, *annamaya puruṣa*, for his real self He is obliged to accept, as the Upanishad expresses it, Matter for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> because his vision here sees Matter as that from which all is born, by which all lives and to which all return in their passing. His natural highest concept of Spirit is an Infinite, preferably an inconscient Infinite, inhabiting or pervading the material universe (which alone it really knows), and manifesting by the power of its presence all these forms around him. His natural highest conception of himself is a vaguely conceived soul or spirit, a soul manifested only by the physical life's experiences, bound up with physical phenomena and forced on its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> to return by an automatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> to the vast indeterminateness of the Infinite. But because he has the power of self-development, he can rise beyond these natural conceptions of the materialised soul; he can supplement them with a certain derivative experience drawn from supraphysical planes and worlds. He can concentrate in mind and develop the mental part of his being, usually at the expense of the fullness of his vital and physical life and in the end the mind predominates and can open to the Beyond. He can concentrate this self-liberating mind on the Spirit. Here too usually in the process he turns away more and more from his full mental and physical life; he limits or discourages their possibilities as much as his material foundation in nature will allow him. In the end his spiritual life predominates, destroys his earthward tendency and breaks its ties and limitations. Spiritualised, he places his real existence beyond in other worlds, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span> of the vital or mental plane; he begins to regard life on earth as a painful or troublesome incident or passage in which he can never arrive at any full <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of his inner ideal self, his spiritual essence. Moreover, his highest conception of the Self or Spirit is apt to be more or less quietistic; for, as we have seen, it is its static infinity alone that he can entirely experience, the still <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of Purusha unlimited by Prakriti, the Soul standing back from Nature. There may come<span class='page-number' id='s-467' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.467]</span> indeed some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> dynamic manifestation in him, but it cannot rise entirely above the heavy limitations of physical Nature. The peace of the silent and passive Self is more easily attainable and he can more easily and fully hold it; too difficult for him is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of an infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, the dynamis of an immeasurable Power.\n\nBut the Spirit can be poised in the principle of Life, not in Matter. The Spirit so founded becomes the vital self of a vital world, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-soul</span> of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Life-energy</span> in the reign of a consciously dynamic Nature. Absorbed in the experiences of the power and play of a conscious Life, it is dominated by the desire, activity and passion of the rajasic principle proper to vital existence. In the individual this spirit becomes a vital soul, *prāṇamaya puruṣa*, in whose nature the life-energies tyrannise over the mental and physical principles. The physical element in a vital world readily shapes its activities and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>formations</span> in response to desire and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span>, it serves and obeys the passion and power of life and their formations and does not thwart or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> them as it does here on earth where life is a precarious incident in inanimate Matter. The mental element too is moulded and limited by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span>, obeys it and helps only to enrich and fulfil the urge of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of its impulses. This vital soul lives in a vital body composed of a substance much subtler than physical matter; it is a substance surcharged with conscious energy, capable of much more powerful perceptions, capacities, sense-activities than any that the gross atomic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of earth-matter can offer. Man too has in himself behind his physical being, subliminal to it, unseen and unknown, but very close to it and forming with it the most naturally active part of his existence, this vital soul, this vital nature and this vital body; a whole vital plane connected with the life-world or desire-world is hidden in us, a secret consciousness in which life and desire find their untrammelled play and their easy self-expression and from there throw their influences and formations on our outer life.\n\nIn proportion as the power of this vital plane manifests itself in man and takes hold of his physical being, this son of<span class='page-number' id='s-468' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.468]</span> earth becomes a vehicle of the life energy, forceful in his desires, vehement in his passions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>, intensely dynamic in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, more and more the rajasic man. It is possible now for him to awaken in his consciousness to the vital plane and to become the vital soul, *prāṇamaya puruṣa*, put on the vital nature and live in the secret vital as well as the visible physical body. If he achieves this change with some fullness or one-pointedness—usually it is under great and salutary limitations or attended by saving complexities—and without rising beyond these things, without climbing to a supra-vital height from which they can be used, purified, uplifted, he becomes the lower type of Asura or Titan, a Rakshasa in nature, a soul of sheer power and life-energy, magnified or racked by a force of unlimited desire and passion, hunted and driven by an active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> and colossal rajasic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span>, but in possession of far greater and more various powers than those of the physical man in the ordinary more inert <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>earth-nature</span>. Even if he develops mind greatly on the vital plane and uses its dynamic energy for self-control as well as for self-satisfaction, it will still be with an Asuric energism (*tapasyā*) although of a higher type and directed to a more governed satisfaction of the rajasic ego.\n\nBut for the vital plane also it is possible, even as on the physical, to rise to a certain spiritual greatness in its own kind. It is open to the vital man to lift himself beyond the conceptions and energies natural to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desire-soul</span> and the desire-plane. He can develop a higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> and, within the conditions of the vital being, concentrate upon some realisation of the Spirit or Self behind or beyond its forms and powers. In this spiritual realisation there would be a less strong necessity of quietism; for there would be a greater possibility of an active effectuation of the bliss and power of the Eternal, mightier and more self-satisfied powers, a richer flowering of the dynamic Infinite. Nevertheless that effectuality could never come anywhere near to a true and integral perfection; for the conditions of the desire-world are like those of the physical improper to the development of the complete spiritual life. The vital being too must develop spirit to the detriment of his fullness, activity and force of life<span class='page-number' id='s-469' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.469]</span> in the lower hemisphere of our existence and turn in the end away from the vital formula, away from life either to the Silence or to an ineffable Power beyond him. If he does not withdraw from life, he must remain enchained by life, limited in his self-fulfilment by the downward pull of the desire-world and its dominant rajasic principle. On the vital plane also, in its own right alone, a perfect perfection is impossible; the soul that attains only so far would have to return to the physical life for a greater experience, a higher self-development, a more direct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> to the Spirit.\n\nAbove matter and life stands the principle of mind, nearer to the secret Origin of things. The Spirit poised in mind becomes the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental self</span> of a mental world and dwells there in the reign of its own pure and luminous mental Nature. There it acts in the intrinsic freedom of the cosmic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Intelligence</span> supported by the combined workings of a psycho-mental and a higher emotional mind-force, subtilised and enlightened by the clarity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> of the sattwic principle proper to the mental existence. In the individual the spirit so poised becomes a mental soul, *manomaya puruṣa*, in whose nature the clarity and luminous power of the mind acts in its own right independent of any limitation or oppression by the vital or corporeal instruments; it rather rules and determines entirely the forms of its body and the powers of its life. For mind in its own plane is not limited by life and obstructed by matter as it is here in the earth-process. This mental soul lives in a mental or subtle body which enjoys capacities of knowledge, perception, sympathy and interpenetration with other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> hardly imaginable by us and a free, delicate and extensive mentalised sense-faculty not limited by the grosser conditions of the life nature or the physical nature.\n\nMan too has in himself, subliminal, unknown and unseen, concealed behind his waking consciousness and visible organism this mental soul, mental nature, mental body and a mental plane, not materialised, in which the principle of Mind is at home and not as here at strife with a world which is alien to it, obstructive to its freedom and corruptive of its purity and clearness. All the higher faculties of man, his intellectual and psycho-mental<span class='page-number' id='s-470' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.470]</span> being and powers, his higher emotional life awaken and increase in proportion as this mental plane in him presses upon him. For the more it manifests, the more it influences the physical parts, the more it enriches and elevates the corresponding mental plane of the embodied nature. At a certain pitch of its increasing sovereignty it can make man truly man and not merely a reasoning animal; for it gives then its characteristic force to that mental being within us which our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> is in the inwardly governing but still too hampered essence of its psychological structure.\n\nIt is possible for man to awaken to this higher mental consciousness, to become this mental being,[^1] put on this mental nature and live not only in the vital and physical sheaths, but in this mental body. If there were a sufficient completeness in this transformation he would become capable of a life and a being at least half divine. For he would enjoy powers and a vision and perceptions beyond the scope of this ordinary life and body; he would govern all by the clarities of pure knowledge; he would be united to other beings by a sympathy of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and happiness; his emotions would be lifted to the perfection of the psycho-mental plane, his sensations rescued from grossness, his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> subtle, pure and flexible, delivered from the deviations of the impure pranic energy and the obstructions of matter. And he would develop too the reflection of a wisdom and bliss higher than any mental joy and knowledge; for he could receive more fully and without our incompetent mind's deforming and falsifying mixture the inspirations and intuitions that are the arrows of the supramental Light and form his perfected mental existence in the mould and power of that vaster splendour. He could then realise too the self or Spirit in a much larger and more luminous and<span class='page-number' id='s-471' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.471]</span> more intimate intensity than is now possible and with a greater play of its active power and bliss in the satisfied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of his existence.\n\n[^1]: I include here in mind, not only the highest range of mind ordinarily known to man, but yet higher ranges to which he has either no current faculty of admission or else only a partial and mixed reception of some faint portion of their powers,—the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illumined mind</span>, the intuition and finally the creative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Overmind</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span> which stands far above and is the source of our present existence. If mind is to be understood only as Reason or human intelligence, then the free mental being and its state would be something much more limited and very inferior to the description given here.\n\nAnd to our ordinary notions this may well seem to be a consummate perfection, something to which man might aspire in his highest flights of idealism. No doubt, it would be a sufficient perfection for the pure mental being in its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>; but it would still fall far below the greater possibilities of the spiritual nature. For here too our spiritual realisation would be subject to the limitations of the mind which is in the nature of a reflected, diluted and diffused or a narrowly intensive light, not the vast and comprehensive self-existent luminosity and joy of the Spirit. That vaster light, that profounder bliss are beyond the mental reaches. Mind indeed can never be a perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of the Spirit; a supreme self-expression is not possible in its movements because to separate, divide, limit is its very character. Even if mind could be free from all positive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> and error, even if it could be all intuitive and infallibly intuitive, it could still present and organise only half-truths or separate truths and these too not in their own body but in luminous representative figures put together to make an accumulated total or a massed structure. Therefore the self-perfecting mental being here must either depart into pure spirit by the shedding of its lower existence or return upon the physical life to develop in it a capacity not yet found in our mental and psychic nature. This is what the Upanishad expresses when it says that the heavens attained by the mind Purusha are those to which man is lifted by the rays of the sun, the diffused, separated, though intense beams of the supramental truth-consciousness, and from these it has to return to the earthly existence. But the illuminates who renouncing earth-life go beyond through the gateways of the sun, do not return hither. The mental being exceeding his sphere does not return because by that transition he enters a high range of existence peculiar to the superior hemisphere. He cannot bring down its greater spiritual nature into this lower triplicity; for here the mental being is the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the Self. Here the triple mental, vital and physical body provides almost the<span class='page-number' id='s-472' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.472]</span> whole range of our capacity and cannot suffice for that greater consciousness; the vessel has not been built to contain a greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>godhead</span> or to house the splendours of this supramental force and knowledge.\n\nThis limitation is true only so long as man remains closed within the boundaries of the mental Maya. If he rises into the knowledge-self beyond the highest mental stature, if he becomes the knowledge-soul, the Spirit poised in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span>, *vijñānamaya puruṣa*, and puts on the nature of its infinite truth and power, if he lives in the knowledge-sheath, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>causal body</span> as well as in these subtle mental, interlinking vital and grosser physical sheaths or bodies, then, but then only he will be able to draw down entirely into his terrestrial existence the fullness of the infinite spiritual consciousness; only then will he avail to raise his total being and even his whole manifested, embodied expressive nature into the spiritual kingdom. But this is difficult in the extreme; for the causal body opens itself readily to the consciousness and capacities of the spiritual planes and belongs in its nature to the higher hemisphere of existence, but it is either not developed at all in man or only as yet crudely developed and organised and veiled behind many intervening portals of the subliminal in us. It draws its stuff from the plane of the truth-knowledge and the plane of the infinite bliss and these pertain altogether to a still inaccessible higher hemisphere. Shedding upon this lower existence their truth and light and joy they are the source of all that we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> spirituality and all that we call perfection. But this infiltration comes from behind thick coverings through which they arrive so tempered and weakened that they are entirely obscured in the materiality of our physical perceptions, grossly distorted and perverted in our vital impulses, perverted too though a little less grossly in our ideative seekings, minimised even in the comparative purity and intensity of the highest intuitive ranges of our mental nature. The supramental principle is secretly lodged in all existence. It is there even in the grossest materiality, it preserves and governs the lower worlds by its hidden power and law; but that power veils itself and that law works unseen through the shackled limitations and limping<span class='page-number' id='s-473' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.473]</span> deformations of the lesser rule of our physical, vital, mental Nature. Yet its governing presence in the lowest forms assures us, because of the unity of all existence, that there is a possibility of their awakening, a possibility even of their perfect manifestation here in spite of every veil, in spite of all the mass of our apparent disabilities, in spite of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> or unwillingness of our mind and life and body. And what is possible, must one day be, for that is the law of the omnipotent Spirit.\n\nThe character of these higher states of the soul and their greater worlds of spiritual Nature is necessarily difficult to seize. Even the Upanishads and the Veda only shadow them out by figures, hints and symbols. Yet it is necessary to attempt some account of their principles and practical effect so far as they can be grasped by the mind that stands on the border of the two hemispheres. The passage beyond that border would be the culmination, the completeness of the Yoga of self-transcendence by self-knowledge. The soul that aspires to perfection, draws back and upward, says the Upanishad, from the physical into the vital and from the vital into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental Purusha</span>, from the mental into the knowledge-soul and from that self of knowledge into the bliss Purusha. This self of bliss is the conscious foundation of perfect Sachchidananda and to pass into it completes the soul's ascension. The mind therefore must try to give to itself some account of this decisive transformation of the embodied consciousness, this radiant transfiguration and self-exceeding of our ever aspiring nature. The description mind can arrive at, can never be adequate to the thing itself, but it may point at least to some indicative shadow of it or perhaps some half-luminous image.<span class='page-number' id='s-474' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.474]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-ladder-of-self-transcendence","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Vijnana or Gnosis","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/vijnana-or-gnosis","prvt":"The Lower Triple Purusha","prvu":"/cwsa/23/the-lower-triple-purusha","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["vijnana-or-gnosis"],"t":"Vijnana or Gnosis","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"In our perfect self-transcendence we pass out and up from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> or half-enlightenment of our mental conscious-being into a greater wisdom-self and truth-power above it, there to dwell in the unwalled light of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>.

But the transition from the mind-self to the knowledge-self is the great and the decisive transition in the Yoga. It is the shaking off of the last hold on us of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> ignorance and our firm foundation in the Truth of things, in a consciousness <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> and inviolable by obscurity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span>, suffering or error.\n\nThis is the first summit which enters into the divine perfection, *sādharmya, sādṛśya*; for all the rest only look up to it or catch some rays of its significance. The highest heights of mind or of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>overmind</span> come still within the belt of a mitigated ignorance; they can refract a divine Light but not pass it on in undiminished power to our lower members. For so long as we are within the triple stratum of mind, life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, our active nature continues to work in the force of the ignorance even when the soul in Mind<span class='page-number' id='s-475' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.475]</span> possesses something of the knowledge. And even if the soul were to reflect or to represent all the largeness of the knowledge in its mental consciousness, it would be unable to mobilise it rightly in force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. The truth in its action might greatly increase, but it would still be pursued by a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>, still condemned to a divisibility which would prevent it from working integrally in the power of the infinite. The power of a divinely <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illumined mind</span> may be immense compared with ordinary powers, but it will still be subject to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> and there can be no perfect correspondence between the force of the effective will and the light of the idea which inspires it. The infinite Presence may be there in status, but the dynamis of the operations of nature still belongs to the lower Prakriti, must follow its triple modes of working and cannot give any adequate form to the greatness within it. This is the tragedy of ineffectivity, of the hiatus between ideal and effective will, of our constant incapacity to work out in living form and action the truth we feel in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner consciousness</span> that pursues all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of mind and life towards the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> behind them. But the *vijñāna* or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span> is not only truth but truth power, it is the very working of the infinite and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>; it is the divine knowledge <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine will</span> in the force and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of a spontaneous and luminous and inevitable self-fulfilment. By the gnosis, then, we change our human into a divine nature.\n\nWhat then is this gnosis and how can we describe it? Two opposite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> have to be avoided, two misconceptions that disfigure opposite sides of the truth of gnosis. One error of intellect-bounded thinkers takes *vijñāna* as synonymous with the other Indian term *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>buddhi</span>* and *buddhi* as synonymous with the reason, the discerning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, the logical intelligence. The systems that accept this significance, pass at once from a plane of pure intellect to a plane of pure spirit. No intermediate power is recognised, no diviner action of knowledge than the pure reason is admitted; the limited human means for fixing truth is taken for the highest possible dynamics of consciousness, its topmost force and original <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. An opposite error, a misconception of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystics</span> identifies *vijñāna* with the consciousness of<span class='page-number' id='s-476' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.476]</span> the Infinite free from all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideation</span> or else ideation packed into one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of thought, lost to other dynamic action in the single and invariable idea of the One. This is the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caitanyaghana</span>* of the Upanishad and is one movement or rather one thread of the many-aspected movement of the gnosis. The gnosis, the Vijnana, is not only this concentrated consciousness of the infinite Essence; it is also and at the same time an infinite knowledge of the myriad play of the Infinite. It contains all ideation (not mental but supramental), but it is not limited by ideation, for it far exceeds all ideative movement. Nor is the gnostic ideation in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> an intellectual thinking; it is not what we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the reason, not a concentrated intelligence. For the reason is mental in its methods, mental in its acquisitions, mental in its basis, but the ideative method of the gnosis is self-luminous, supramental, its yield of thought-light spontaneous, not proceeding by acquisition, its thought-basis a rendering of conscious identities, not a translation of the impressions born of indirect contacts. There is a relation and even a sort of broken <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> between the two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of thought; for one proceeds covertly from the other, mind is born from that which is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> mind. But they act on different planes and reverse each other's process.\n\nEven the purest reason, the most luminous rational <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span> is not the gnosis. Reason or intellect is only the lower *buddhi*; it is dependent for its action on the percepts of the sense-mind and on the concepts of the mental intelligence. It is not like the gnosis, self-luminous, authentic, making the subject one with the object. There is, indeed, a higher form of the *buddhi* that can be called the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intuitive mind</span> or intuitive reason, and this by its intuitions, its inspirations, its swift revelatory vision, its luminous insight and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span> can do the work of the reason with a higher power, a swifter action, a greater and spontaneous certitude. It acts in a self-light of the truth which does not depend upon the torch-flares of the sense-mind and its limited uncertain percepts; it proceeds not by intelligent but by visional concepts: it is a kind of truth-vision, truth-hearing, truth-memory, direct truth-discernment. This true and authentic intuition must be distinguished from a power of the ordinary<span class='page-number' id='s-477' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.477]</span> mental reason which is too easily confused with it, the power of involved reasoning that reaches its conclusion by a bound and does not need the ordinary steps of the logical mind. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logical reason</span> proceeds pace after pace and tries the sureness of each step like a man who is walking over unsafe ground and has to test by the hesitating touch of his foot each span of soil that he perceives with his eye. But this other supralogical process of the reason is a motion of rapid insight or swift discernment; it proceeds by a stride or leap, like a man who springs from one sure spot to another point of sure footing,—or at least held by him to be sure. He sees the space he covers in one compact and flashing view, but he does not distinguish or measure either by eye or touch its successions, features and circumstances. This movement has something of the sense of power of the intuition, something of its velocity, some appearance of its light and certainty, and we always are apt to take it for the intuition. But our assumption is an error and, if we trust to it, may lead us into grievous blunders.\n\nIt is even thought by the intellectualists that the intuition itself is nothing more than this rapid process in which the whole action of the logical mind is swiftly done or perhaps half-consciously or subconsciously done, not deliberately worked out in its reasoned method. In its nature, however, this proceeding is quite different from the intuition and it is not necessarily a truth-movement. The power of its leap may end in a stumble, its swiftness may betray, its certainty is too often a confident error. The validity of its conclusions must always depend on a subsequent verification or support from the evidence of the sense-perceptions or a rational linking of intelligent conceptions must intervene to explain to it its own certitudes. This lower light may indeed receive very readily a mixture of actual intuition into it and then a pseudo-intuitive or half-intuitive mind is created, very misleading by its frequent luminous successes palliating a whirl of intensely self-assured false certitudes. The true intuition on the contrary carries in itself its own guarantee of truth; it is sure and infallible within its limits. And so long as it is pure intuition and does not admit into itself any mixture of sense-error or<span class='page-number' id='s-478' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.478]</span> intellectual ideation, it is never contradicted by experience: the intuition may be verified by the reason or the sense-perception afterwards, but its truth does not depend on that verification, it is assured by an automatic self-evidence. If the reason depending on its inferences contradicts the greater light, it will be found in the end on ampler knowledge that the intuitional conclusion was correct and that the more plausible rational and inferential conclusion was an error. For the true intuition proceeds from the self-existent truth of things and is secured by that self-existent truth and not by any indirect, derivatory or dependent method of arriving at knowledge.\n\nBut even the intuitive reason is not the gnosis; it is only an edge of light of the supermind finding its way by flashes of illumination into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> like lightnings in dim and cloudy places. Its inspirations, revelations, intuitions, self-luminous discernings are messages from a higher knowledge-plane that make their way opportunely into our lower level of consciousness. The very character of the intuitive mind sets a gulf of great difference between its action and the action of the self-contained gnosis. In the first place it acts by separate and limited illuminations and its truth is restricted to the often narrow reach or the one brief spot of knowledge lit up by that one lightning-flash with which its intervention begins and terminates. We see the action of the instinct in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span>,—an automatic intuition in that vital or sense-mind which is the highest and surest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> that the animal has to rely on, since it does not possess the human light of the reason, only a cruder and yet ill-formed intelligence. And we can observe at once that the marvellous truth of this instinct which seems so much surer than the reason, is limited in the bird, beast or insect to some particular and restricted utility it is admitted to serve. When the vital mind of the animal tries to act beyond that restricted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span>, it blunders in a much blinder way than the reason of man and has to learn with difficulty by a succession of sense-experiences. The higher mental intuition of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> is an inner visional, not a sense intuition; for it illumines the intelligence and not the sense-mind, it is self-conscious and luminous, not a half-subconscious blind light: it<span class='page-number' id='s-479' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.479]</span> is freely self-acting, not mechanically automatic. But still, even when it is not marred by the imitative pseudo-intuition, it is restricted in man like the instinct in the animal, restricted to a particular purpose of will or knowledge as is the instinct to a particular life utility or Nature purpose. And when the intelligence, as is its almost invariable habit, tries to make use of it, to apply it, to add to it, it builds round the intuitive nucleus in its own characteristic fashion a mass of mixed truth and error. More often than not, by foisting an element of sense-error and conceptual error into the very substance of the intuition or by coating it up in mental additions and deviations, it not merely deflects but deforms its truth and converts it into a falsehood. At the best therefore the intuition gives us only a limited, though an intense light; at the worst, through our misuse of it or false imitations of it, it may lead us into perplexities and confusions which the less ambitious intellectual reason avoids by remaining satisfied with its own safe and plodding method,—safe for the inferior purposes of the reason, though never a satisfying <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> to the inner truth of things.\n\nIt is possible to cultivate and extend the use of the intuitive mind in proportion as we rely less predominantly upon the reasoning intelligence. We may train our mentality not to seize, as it does now, upon every separate flash of intuitive illumination for its own inferior purposes, not to precipitate our thought at once into a crystallising intellectual action around it; we can train it to think in a stream of successive and connected intuitions, to pour light upon light in a brilliant and triumphant series. We shall succeed in this difficult change in proportion as we purify the interfering intelligence,—if we can reduce in it the element of material thought enslaved to the external appearances of things, the element of vital thought enslaved to the wishes, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, impulses of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span>, the element of intellectual thought enslaved to our preferred, already settled or congenial ideas, conceptions, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>, fixed operations of intelligence, if, having reduced to a minimum those <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>, we can replace them by an intuitive vision and sense of things, an intuitive insight into appearances, an intuitive will, an intuitive ideation. This is hard<span class='page-number' id='s-480' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.480]</span> enough for our consciousness naturally bound by the triple tie of mentality, vitality, corporeality to its own imperfection and ignorance, the upper, middle and lower cord in the Vedic parable of the soul's bondage, cords of the mixed truth and falsehood of appearances by which Shunahshepa was bound to the post of sacrifice.\n\nBut even if this difficult thing were perfectly accomplished, still the intuition would not be the gnosis; it would only be its thin prolongation into mind or its sharp edge of first entrance. The difference, not easy to define except by symbols, may be expressed if we take the Vedic image in which the Sun represents the gnosis and the sky, mid-air and earth the mentality, vitality, physicality of man and of the universe. Living on the earth, climbing into the mid-air or even winging in the sky, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span>, the *manomaya* Purusha, would still live in the rays of the sun and not in its bodily light. And in those rays he would see things not as they are, but as reflected in his organ of vision, deformed by its faults or limited in their truth by its restrictions. But the *vijñānamaya* Purusha lives in the Sun itself, in the very body and blaze of the true light;[^1] he knows this light to be his own self-luminous being and he sees besides all that dwells in the rays of the sun, sees the whole truth of the lower triplicity and each thing that is in it. He sees it not by reflection in a mental organ of vision, but with the Sun of gnosis itself as his eye,—for the Sun, says the Veda, is the eye of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span>. The mental being, even in the intuitive mind, can perceive the truth only by a brilliant reflection or limited communication and subject to the restrictions and the inferior <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of the mental vision; but the supramental being sees it by the gnosis itself, from the very centre and outwelling fount of the truth, in its very form and by its own spontaneous and self-illumining process. For the Vijnana is a direct and divine as opposed to an indirect and human knowledge.\n\n[^1]: So the Sun is called in the Veda, *ṛtaṁ jyotiḥ*.\n\nThe nature of the gnosis can only be indicated to the intellect by contrasting it with the nature of the intellect, and even then<span class='page-number' id='s-481' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.481]</span> the phrases we must use cannot illuminate unless aided by some amount of actual experience. For what language forged by the reason can express the suprarational? Fundamentally, this is the difference between these two powers that the mental reason proceeds with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> from ignorance to truth, but the gnosis has in itself the direct contact, the immediate vision, the easy and constant possession of the truth and has no need of seeking or any kind of procedure. The reason starts with appearances and labours, never or seldom losing at least a partial dependence on appearances, to arrive at the truth behind them; it shows the truth in the light of the appearances. The gnosis starts from the truth and shows the appearances in the light of the truth; it is itself the body of the truth and its spirit. The reason proceeds by inference, it concludes; but the gnosis proceeds by identity or vision,—it is, sees and knows. As directly as the physical vision sees and grasps the appearance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, so and far more directly the gnosis sees and grasps the truth of things. But where the physical sense gets into relation with objects by a veiled contact, the gnosis gets into identity with things by an unveiled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>. Thus it is able to know all things as a man knows his own existence, simply, convincingly, directly. To the reason only what the senses give is direct knowledge, *pratyakṣa*, the rest of truth is arrived at indirectly; to the gnosis all its truth is direct knowledge, *pratyakṣa*. Therefore the truth gained by the intellect is an acquisition over which there hangs always a certain shadow of doubt, an incompleteness, a surrounding penumbra of night and ignorance or half-knowledge, a possibility of alteration or annullation by farther knowledge. The truth of the gnosis is free from doubt, self-evident, self-existent, irrefragable, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span>.\n\nThe reason has as its first instrument <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> general, analytical and synthetic; it aids itself by comparison, contrast and analogy,—proceeds from experience to indirect knowledge by logical processes of deduction, induction, all kinds of inference,—rests upon <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span>, reaches out beyond itself by imagination, secures itself by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span>: all is a process of groping and seeking. The gnosis does not seek, it possesses. Or if it has to enlighten, it does not even then seek; it reveals, it illumines. In<span class='page-number' id='s-482' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.482]</span> a consciousness transmuted from intelligence to gnosis, imagination would be replaced by truth-inspiration, mental judgment would give place to a self-luminous discerning. The slow and stumbling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logical process</span> from reasoning to conclusion would be pushed out by a swift intuitive proceeding; the conclusion or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> would be seen at once in its own right, by its own self-sufficient witness, and all the evidence by which we arrive at it would be seen too at once, along with it, in the same comprehensive figure, not as its evidence, but as its intimate conditions, connections and relations, its constituent parts or its wings of circumstance. Mental and sense observation would be changed into an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner vision</span> using the instruments as channels, but not dependent on them as the mind in us is blind and deaf without the physical senses, and this vision would see not merely the thing, but all its truth, its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, powers, the eternities within it. Our uncertain memory would fall away and there would come in its place a luminous possession of knowledge, the divine memory that is not a store of acquisition, but holds all things always contained in the consciousness, a memory at once of past, present and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>.\n\nFor while the reason proceeds from moment to moment of time and loses and acquires and again loses and again acquires, the gnosis dominates time in a one view and perpetual power and links past, present and future in their indivisible connections, in a single continuous map of knowledge, side by side. The gnosis starts from the totality which it immediately possesses; it sees parts, groups and details only in relation to the totality and in one vision with it: the mental reason cannot really see the totality at all and does not know fully any whole except by starting from an analysis and synthesis of its parts, masses and details; otherwise its whole-view is always a vague apprehension or an imperfect comprehension or a confused summary of indistinct features. The reason deals with constituents and processes and properties; it tries in vain to form by them an idea of the thing in itself, its reality, its essence. But the gnosis sees the thing in itself first, penetrates to its original and eternal nature, adjoins its processes and properties only as a self-expression of its nature. The reason dwells in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> and is its prisoner: it deals<span class='page-number' id='s-483' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.483]</span> with things separately and treats each as a separate existence, as it deals with sections of Time and divisions of Space; it sees unity only in a sum or by elimination of diversity or as a general conception and a vacant figure. But the gnosis dwells in the unity and knows by it all the nature of the diversities; it starts from the unity and sees diversities only of a unity, not diversities constituting the one, but a unity constituting its own multitudes. The gnostic knowledge, the gnostic sense does not recognise any real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>; it does not treat things separately as if they were independent of their true and original oneness. The reason deals with the finite and is helpless before the infinite: it can conceive of it as an indefinite extension in which the finite acts, but the infinite in itself it can with difficulty conceive and cannot at all grasp or penetrate. But the gnosis is, sees and lives in the infinite; it starts always from the infinite and knows finite things only in their relation to the infinite and in the sense of the infinite.\n\nIf we would describe the gnosis as it is in its own awareness, not thus imperfectly as it is to us in contrast with our own reason and intelligence, it is hardly possible to speak of it except in figures and symbols. And first we must remember that the gnostic level, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahat</span>, Vijnana, is not the supreme plane of our consciousness, but a middle or link plane. Interposed between the triune glory of the utter Spirit, the infinite existence, consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> of the Eternal and our lower triple being and nature, it is as if it stood there as the mediating, formulated, organising and creative wisdom, power and joy of the Eternal. In the gnosis Sachchidananda gathers up the light of his unseizable existence and pours it out on the soul in the shape and power of a divine knowledge, a divine will and a divine bliss of existence. It is as if infinite light were gathered up into the compact orb of the sun and lavished on all that depends upon the sun in radiances that continue for ever. But the gnosis is not only light, it is force; it is creative knowledge, it is the self-effective truth of the divine Idea. This idea is not creative imagination, not something that constructs in a void, but light and power of eternal substance, truth-light full of truth-force; and it brings out what is latent in being, it does not create a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> that never<span class='page-number' id='s-484' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.484]</span> was in being. The ideation of the gnosis is radiating light-stuff of the consciousness of the eternal Existence; each ray is a truth. The will in the gnosis is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> of eternal knowledge; it throws the consciousness and substance of being into infallible forms of truth-power, forms that embody the idea and make it faultlessly effective, and it works out each truth-power and each truth-form spontaneously and rightly according to its nature. Because it carries this creative force of the divine Idea, the Sun, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> and symbol of the gnosis, is described in the Veda as the Light which is the father of all things, Surya Savitri, the Wisdom-Luminous who is the bringer-out into manifest existence. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> is inspired by the divine delight, the eternal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>; it is full of the joy of its own truth and power, it creates in bliss, creates out of bliss, creates that which is blissful. Therefore the world of the gnosis, the supramental world is the true and the happy creation, *ṛtam, bhadram*, since all in it shares in the perfect joy that made it. A divine radiance of undeviating knowledge, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine power</span> of unfaltering will and a divine ease of unstumbling bliss are the nature or Prakriti of the soul in supermind, in *vijñāna*.\n\nThe stuff of the gnostic or supramental plane is made of the perfect absolutes of all that is here imperfect and relative and its movement of the reconciled interlockings and happy fusions of all that here are opposites. For behind the appearance of these opposites are their truths and the truths of the Eternal are not in conflict with each other; our mind's and life's opposites transformed in the supermind into their own true spirit link together and are seen as tones and colourings of an eternal Reality and everlasting Ananda. Supermind or Gnosis is the supreme Truth, the supreme Thought, the supreme Word, the supreme Sight, the supreme Will-Idea; it is the inner and outer extension of the Infinite who is beyond Space, the unfettered Time of the Eternal who is timeless, the supernal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of all absolutes of the Absolute.\n\nTo the envisaging mind there are three powers of the Vijnana. Its supreme power knows and receives into it from above all the infinite existence, consciousness and bliss of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>;<span class='page-number' id='s-485' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.485]</span> it is in its highest height the absolute knowledge and force of eternal Sachchidananda. Its second power concentrates the Infinite into a dense luminous consciousness, *caitanyaghana* or *cidghana*, the seed-state of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span> in which are contained living and concrete all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> principles of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine being</span> and all the inviolable truths of the divine conscious-idea and nature. Its third power brings or looses out these things by the effective ideation, vision, authentic identities of the divine knowledge, movement of the divine will-force, vibration of the divine delight intensities into a universal harmony, an illimitable diversity, a manifold rhythm of their powers, forms and interplay of living consequences. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental Purusha</span> rising into the *vijñānamaya* must ascend into these three powers.

It must convert its conscious stuff of mental nature into the *cidghana* or dense self-luminous consciousness. It must transform its conscious substance into a gnostic self or Truth-self of infinite Sachchidananda.

In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to be characteristically human it has to become first a sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, sense of desire, sense of will, sense of intelligent will-action or mentally conscious sense of force-action.

The gnostic (*vijñānamaya*) being is in its character a truth-consciousness, a centre and circumference of the truth-vision of things, a massed movement or subtle body of gnosis. Its action is a self-fulfilling and radiating action of the truth-power of things according to the inner law of their deepest truest self and nature. This truth of things at which we must arrive before we can enter into the gnosis,—for in that all exists and from that all originates on the gnostic plane,—is, first of all, a truth of unity, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span>, but of unity originating <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span>, unity in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>multiplicity</span> and still unity<span class='page-number' id='s-489' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.489]</span> always, an indefeasible oneness. State of gnosis, the condition of *vijñānamaya* being, is impossible without an ample and close self-identification of ourselves with all existence and with all existences, a universal pervasiveness, a universal comprehension or containing, a certain all-in-allness. The gnostic Purusha has normally the consciousness of itself as infinite, normally too the consciousness of containing the world in itself and exceeding it; it is not like the divided mental being normally bound to a consciousness that feels itself contained in the world and a part of it. It follows that a deliverance from the limiting and imprisoning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ego</span> is the first elementary step towards the being of the gnosis; for so long as we live in the ego, it is idle to hope for this higher reality, this vast self-consciousness, this true self-knowledge. The least reversion to ego-thought, ego-action, ego-will brings back the consciousness tumbling out of such gnostic Truth as it has attained into the falsehoods of the divided mind-nature. A secure universality of being is the very basis of this luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span>. Abandoning all rigid separateness (but getting instead a certain transcendent overlook or independence) we have to feel ourselves one with all things and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, to identify ourselves with them, to become aware of them as ourselves, to feel their being as our own, to admit their consciousness as part of ours, to contact their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> as intimate to our energy, to learn how to be one self with all. That oneness is not indeed all that is needed, but it is a first condition and without it there is no gnosis.\n\nThis universality is impossible to achieve in its completeness so long as we continue to feel ourselves, as we now feel, a consciousness lodged in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span>. There has to be a certain elevation of the Purusha out of the physical and even out of the mental into the *vijñānamaya* body. No longer can the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> nor its corresponding mental \"lotus\" remain the centre of our thinking, no longer the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> nor its corresponding \"lotus\" the originating centre of our emotional and sensational being. The conscious centre of our being, our thought, our will and action, even the original force of our sensations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> rise out of the body and mind and take a free station above them. No longer have we the sensation of living in the body, but<span class='page-number' id='s-490' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.490]</span> are above it as its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span>, possessor or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> and at the same time encompass it with a wider consciousness than that of the imprisoned physical sense. Now we come to realise with a very living force of reality, normal and continuous, what the sages meant when they spoke of the soul carrying the body or when they said that the soul is not in the body, but the body in the soul. It is from above the body and not from the brain that we shall ideate and will; the brain-action will become only a response and movement of the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> to the shock of the thought-force and will-force from above.

It is not involved in body; it is not shut up in a separated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> feeling out for clumsy contacts with the world outside or groping inward for its own deeper spirit. For in this great transformation we begin to have a consciousness not shut up in a generating box, but diffused freely and extending self-existently everywhere; there is or may be a centre, but it is a convenience for individual action, not rigid, not constitutive or separative. The very nature of our conscious activities is henceforth universal; one with those of the universal being, it proceeds from universality to a supple and variable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individualisation</span>. It has become the awareness of an infinite being who acts always universally though with emphasis on an individual formation of its energies. But this emphasis is differential rather than separative, and this formation is no longer what we now understand by individuality; there is no longer a petty limited constructed person shut up in the formula of his own mechanism. This state of consciousness is so abnormal to our present mode of being that to the rational man who does not possess it it may seem impossible or even a state of alienation; but once<span class='page-number' id='s-491' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.491]</span> possessed it vindicates itself even to the mental intelligence by its greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, light, power, effectivity of will, verifiable truth of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideation</span> and feeling. For this condition begins already on the higher levels of liberated mind, and can therefore be partly sensed and understood by mind-intelligence, but it rises to perfect self-possession only when it leaves behind the mental levels, only in the supramental gnosis.\n\nIn this state of consciousness the infinite becomes to us the primal, the actual reality, the one thing immediately and sensibly true. It becomes impossible for us to think of or realise the finite apart from our fundamental sense of the infinite, in which alone the finite can live, can form itself, can have any reality or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duration</span>. So long as this finite mind and body are to our consciousness the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of our existence and the foundation of all our thinking, feeling and willing and so long as things finite are the normal reality from which we can rise occasionally, or even frequently, to an idea and sense of the infinite, we are still very far away from the gnosis. In the plane of the gnosis the infinite is at once our normal consciousness of being, its first fact, our sensible substance. It is very concretely to us there the foundation from which everything finite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> itself and its boundless incalculable forces are the origination of all our thought, will and delight. But this infinite is not only an infinite of pervasion or of extension in which everything forms and happens. Behind that immeasurable extension the gnostic consciousness is always aware of a spaceless inner infinite. It is through this double infinite that we shall arrive at the essential being of Sachchidananda, the highest self of our own being and the totality of our cosmic existence. There is opened to us an illimitable existence which we feel as if it were an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> above us to which we attempt to rise and an infinity around us into which we strive to dissolve our separate existence. Afterwards we widen into it and rise into it; we break out of the ego into its largeness and are that for ever. If this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> is achieved, its power can take, if so we will, increasing possession of our lower being also until even our lowest and perversest activities are refashioned into the truth of the Vijnana.<span class='page-number' id='s-492' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.492]</span>\n\nThis is the basis, this sense of the infinite and possession by the infinite, and only when it is achieved, can we progress towards some normality of the supramental ideation, perception, sense, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>, awareness. For even this sense of the infinite is only a first foundation and much more has to be done before the consciousness can become dynamically gnostic. The supramental knowledge is the play of a supreme light; there are many other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span>, other levels of knowledge higher than human mind which can open in us and receive or reflect something of that effulgence even before we rise into the gnosis. But to command or wholly possess it we must first enter into and become the being of the supreme light, our consciousness must be transformed into that consciousness, its principle and power of self-awareness and all-awareness by identity must be the very stuff of our existence. For our means and ways of knowledge and action must necessarily be according to the nature of our consciousness and it is the consciousness that must radically change if we are to command and not only be occasionally visited by that higher power of knowledge. But it is not confined to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher thought</span> or the action of a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine reason</span>. It takes up all our present means of knowledge immensely extended, active and effective where they are now debarred, blind, infructuous, and turns them into a high and intense perceptive activity of the Vijnana. Thus it takes up our sense action and illumines it even in its ordinary field so that we get a true sense of things. But also it enables the mind-sense to have a direct perception of the inner as well as the outer phenomenon, to feel and receive or perceive, for instance, the thoughts, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, sensations, the nervous reactions of the object on which it is turned.[^2] It uses the subtle senses as well as the physical and saves them from their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span>. It gives us the knowledge, the experience of planes of existence other than the material to which our ordinary mentality is ignorantly attached and it enlarges the world for us. It transforms similarly the<span class='page-number' id='s-493' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.493]</span> sensations and gives them their full intensity as well as their full holding-power; for in our normal mentality the full intensity is impossible because the power to hold and sustain vibrations <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> a certain point is denied to it, mind and body would both break under the shock or the prolonged strain. It takes up too the element of knowledge in our feelings and emotions,—for our feelings too contain a power of knowledge and a power of effectuation which we do not recognise and do not properly develop,—and delivers them at the same time from their limitations and from their errors and perversions. For in all things the gnosis is the Truth, the Right, the highest Law, *devānām adabdhāni vratāni*.\n\n[^2]: This power, says Patanjali, comes by \"*saṁyama*\" on an object. That is for the mentality, in the gnosis there is no need of *saṁyama*. For this kind of perception is the natural action of the Vijnana.\n\nKnowledge and Force or Will—for all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscious force</span> is will—are the twin sides of the action of consciousness. In our mentality they are divided. The idea comes first, the will comes stumbling after it or rebels against it or is used as its imperfect tool with imperfect results; or else the will starts up first with a blind or half-seeing idea in it and works out something in confusion of which we get the right understanding afterwards. There is no oneness, no full understanding between these powers in us; or else there is no perfect correspondence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> with effectuation. Nor is the individual will in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> with the universal; it tries to reach beyond it or falls short of it or deviates from and strives against it. It knows not the times and seasons of the Truth, nor its degrees and measures. The Vijnāna takes up the will and puts it first into harmony and then into oneness with the truth of the supramental knowledge. In this knowledge the idea in the individual is one with the idea in the universal, because both are brought back to the truth of the supreme Knowledge and the transcendent Will. The gnosis takes up not only our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligent will</span>, but our wishes, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, even what we call the lower desires, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, the impulses, the reachings out of sense and sensation and it transforms them. They cease to be wishes and desires, because they cease first to be personal and then cease to be that struggling after the ungrasped which we mean by craving and desire. No longer blind or half-blind reachings out of the instinctive or intelligent mentality, they<span class='page-number' id='s-494' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.494]</span> are transformed into a various action of the Truth-will; and that will acts with an inherent knowledge of the right measures of its decreed action and therefore with an effectivity unknown to our mental willing. Therefore too in the action of the *vijñānamaya* will there is no place for sin; for all sin is an error of the will, a desire and act of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>.\n\nWhen desire ceases entirely, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and all inner suffering also cease. The Vijnana takes up not only our parts of knowledge and will, but our parts of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> and delight and changes them into action of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>. For if knowledge and force are the twin sides or powers of the action of consciousness, delight, Ananda—which is something higher than what we call pleasure—is the very stuff of consciousness and the natural result of the interaction of knowledge and will, force and self-awareness. Both pleasure and pain, both <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and grief are deformations caused by the disturbance of harmony between our consciousness and the force it applies, between our knowledge and will, a breaking up of their oneness by a descent to a lower plane in which they are limited, divided in themselves, restrained from their full and proper action, at odds with other-force, other-consciousness, other-knowledge, other-will. The Vijnana sets this to rights by the power of its truth and a wholesale restoration to oneness and harmony, to the Right and the highest Law. It takes up all our emotions and turns them into various forms of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and delight, even our hatreds, repulsions, causes of suffering. It finds out or reveals the meaning they missed and by missing it became the perversions they are; it restores our whole nature to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Good</span>. It deals similarly with our perceptions and sensations and reveals all the delight that they seek, but in its truth, not in any perversion and wrong seeking and wrong reception; it teaches even our lower impulses to lay hold on the Divine and Infinite in the appearances after which they run. All this is done not in the values of the lower being, but by a lifting up of the mental, vital, material into the inalienable purity, the natural intensity, the continual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>, one yet manifold, of the divine Ananda.\n\nThus the being of Vijnana is in all its activities a play of<span class='page-number' id='s-495' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.495]</span> perfected knowledge-power, will-power, delight-power, raised to a higher than the mental, vital and bodily level. All-pervasive, universalised, freed from egoistic personality and individuality, it is the play of a higher Self, a higher consciousness and therefore a higher force and higher delight of being. All that acts in the Vijnana in the purity, in the right, in the truth of the superior or divine Prakriti. Its powers may often seem to be what are called in ordinary Yogic parlance siddhis, by the Europeans <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occult powers</span>, shunned and dreaded by devotees and by many Yogins as snares, stumbling-blocks, diversions from the true seeking after the Divine. But they have that character and are dangerous here because they are sought in the lower being, abnormally, by the ego for an egoistic satisfaction. In the Vijnana they are neither occult nor siddhis, but the open, unforced and normal play of its nature. The Vijnana is the Truth-power and Truth-action of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Being</span> in its divine identities, and, when this acts through the individual lifted to the gnostic plane, it fulfils itself unperverted, without fault or egoistic reaction, without diversion from the possession of the Divine. There the individual is no longer the ego, but the free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jiva</span> domiciled in the higher <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span> of which he is a portion, *parā prakṛtir jīvabhūtā*,. the nature of the supreme and universal Self seen indeed in the play of multiple individuality but without the veil of ignorance, with self-knowledge, in its multiple oneness, in the truth of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Shakti</span>.\n\nIn the Vijnana the right relation and action of Purusha and Prakriti are found, because there they become unified and the Divine is no longer veiled in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. All is his action. The Jiva no longer says \"I think, I act, I desire, I feel\"; he does not even say like the sadhaka striving after unity but before he has reached it, \"As appointed by Thee seated in my heart, I act.\" For the heart, the centre of the mental consciousness is no longer the centre of origination but only a blissful channel. He is rather aware of the Divine seated above, lord of all, *adhiṣṭhita*, as well as acting within him. And seated himself in that higher being, *parārdhe, paramasyāṁ parāvati*, he can say truly and boldly, \"God himself by his Prakriti knows, acts, loves, takes delight<span class='page-number' id='s-496' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.496]</span> through my individuality and its figures and fulfils there in its higher and divine measures the multiple *līlā* which the Infinite for ever plays in the universality which is himself for ever.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-497' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.497]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-conditions-of-attainment-to-the-gnosis","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Gnosis and Ananda","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/gnosis-and-ananda","prvt":"Vijnana or Gnosis","prvu":"/cwsa/23/vijnana-or-gnosis","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["gnosis-and-ananda"],"t":"Gnosis and Ananda","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span>, the possession of something of the gnostic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> must elevate the soul of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and sublimate his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in the world into a glory of light and power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinity</span> that can seem in comparison with the lame <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and limited realisations of our present mental and physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> the very status and dynamis of a perfection final and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span>. And it is a true perfection, such as nothing before it has yet been in the ascension of the spirit. For even the highest spiritual realisation on the plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> has in it something top-heavy, one-sided and exclusive; even the widest mental spirituality is not wide enough and it is marred too by its imperfect power of self-expression in life. And yet in comparison with what is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> it, this too, this first gnostic splendour is only a bright passage to a more perfect perfection. It is the secure and shining step from which we can happily mount still upwards into the absolute infinities which are the origin and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of the incarnating spirit. In this farther ascension the gnosis does not disappear, but reaches rather its own supreme Light out of which it has descended to mediate between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Infinite</span>.\n\nThe Upanishad tells us that after the knowledge-self above the mental is possessed and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the lower selves have been drawn up into it, there is another and last step of all still left to us—though <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> might ask, is it eternally the last or only the last practically conceivable or at all necessary for us now?—to take up our gnostic existence into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss-Self</span> and there complete the spiritual self-discovery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> Infinite. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>, a supreme Bliss <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span>, far other and higher in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> than the highest human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> or pleasure, is the essential and original <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the spirit. In Ananda our spirit will find its true self, in Ananda its essential consciousness, in Ananda the absolute power of its<span class='page-number' id='s-498' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.498]</span> existence. The embodied soul's entry into this highest absolute, unlimited, unconditional bliss of the spirit is the infinite <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> and the infinite perfection. It is true that something of this bliss can be enjoyed by reflection, by a qualified descent even on the lower planes where the Purusha plays with his modified and qualified Nature. There can be the experience of a spiritual and boundless Ananda on the plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, on the plane of life, on the plane of mind as well as on the gnostic truth-plane of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and above it. And the Yogin who enters into these lesser realisations, may find them so complete and compelling that he will imagine there is nothing greater, nothing beyond it. For each of the divine principles contains in itself the whole potentiality of all the other six notes of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>; each plane of Nature can have its own perfection of these notes under its own conditions. But the integral perfection can come only by a mounting ascent of the lowest into the highest and an incessant descent of the highest into the lowest till all becomes one at once solid block and plastic sea-stuff of the Truth infinite and eternal.\n\nThe very physical consciousness in man, the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>annamaya puruṣa</span>*, can without this supreme ascent and integral descent yet reflect and enter into the self of Sachchidananda. It can do it either by a reflection of the Soul in physical Nature, its bliss, power and infinity secret but still present here, or by losing its separate sense of substance and existence in the Self within or without it. The result is a glorified sleep of the physical mind in which the physical being forgets itself in a kind of conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nirvana</span> or else moves about like a thing inert in the hands of Nature, *jaḍavat*, like a leaf in the wind, or otherwise a state of pure happy and free irresponsibility of action, *bālavat*, a divine childhood. But this comes without the higher glories of knowledge and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> which belong to the same status upon a more exalted level. It is an inert realisation of Sachchidananda in which there is neither any mastery of the Prakriti by the Purusha nor any sublimation of Nature into her own supreme power, the infinite glories of the Para Shakti. Yet these two, this mastery and this sublimation, are the two gates of perfection, the splendid doors into the supreme Eternal.<span class='page-number' id='s-499' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.499]</span>\n\nThe life soul and life consciousness in man, *prāṇamaya puruṣa*, can in the same way directly reflect and enter into the self of Sachchidananda by a large and splendid and blissful reflection of the Soul in universal Life or by losing its separate sense of life and existence in the vast Self within or without it. The result is either a profound state of sheer self-oblivion or else an action driven irresponsibly by the life nature, an exalted enthusiasm of self-abandonment to the great world-energy in its vitalistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dance</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer being</span> lives in a God-possessed frenzy careless of itself and the world, *unmattavat*, or with an entire disregard whether of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conventions</span> and proprieties of fitting human action or of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> and rhythms of a greater Truth. It acts as the unbound vital being, *piśācavat*, the divine maniac or else the divine demoniac. Here too there is no mastery or supreme sublimation of nature. There is only a joyful static possession by the Self within us and an unregulated dynamic possession by the physical and the vital Nature without us.\n\nThe mind soul and mind consciousness in man, *manomaya puruṣa*, can in the same direct way reflect and enter into Sachchidananda by a reflection of the Soul as it mirrors itself in the nature of pure universal mind luminous, unwalled, happy, plastic, illimitable, or by absorption in the vast free unconditioned uncentred Self within it and without it. The result is either the immobile cessation of all mind and action or a desire-free unbound action watched by the unparticipating inner Witness. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> becomes the eremite soul alone in the world and careless of all human ties or the saint soul that lives in a rapturous God-nearness or felicitous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> and in joyful relations of pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> towards all creatures. The mental being may even realise the Self in all three planes together. Then he is all these things alternately, successively or at once. Or he may transform the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> into manifestations of the higher state; he may draw upward the childlikeness or the inert irresponsibility of the free physical mind or the free vital mind's divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span> and carelessness of all rules, proprieties, harmonies and colour or disguise with them the ecstasy of the saint or the solitary liberty of the wandering eremite. Here again there is no mastery, no<span class='page-number' id='s-500' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.500]</span> sublimation of the Nature by the soul in the world, but a double possession, by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and delight of the mental-spiritual infinite within and without by the happy, natural and unregulated play of the mind-Nature. But since the mental being is capable of receiving the gnosis in a way in which the life soul and physical soul cannot receive it, since he can accept it with knowledge though only the limited knowledge of a mental response, he may to a certain extent govern by its light his outer action or, if not that, at least bathe and purify in it his will and his thinkings. But Mind can arrive only at a compromise between the infinite within and the finite nature without; it cannot pour the infinity of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span>'s knowledge and power and bliss with any sense of fullness into its external action which remains always inadequate. Still it is content and free because it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> within who takes up the responsibility of the action adequate or inadequate, assumes its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> and fixes its consequence.\n\nBut the gnostic soul, the *vijñānamaya puruṣa*, is the first to participate not only in the freedom, but in the power and sovereignty of the Eternal. For it receives the fullness, it has the sense of plenitude of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span> in its action; it shares the free, splendid and royal march of the Infinite, is a vessel of the original knowledge, the immaculate power, the inviolable bliss, transmutes all life into the eternal Light and the eternal Fire and the eternal Wine of the nectar. It possesses the infinite of the Self and it possesses the infinite of Nature. It does not so much lose as find its nature self in the self of the Infinite. On the other planes to which the mental being has easier access, man finds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in himself and himself in God; he becomes divine in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> rather than in person or nature. In the gnosis, even the mentalised gnosis, the Divine Eternal possesses, changes and stamps the human symbol, envelops and partly finds himself in the person and nature. The mental being at most receives or reflects that which is true, divine and eternal; the gnostic soul reaches a true identity, possesses the spirit and power of the truth-Nature. In the gnosis the dualism of Purusha and Prakriti, Soul and Nature, two separate powers complementary to each other, the great truth of the Sankhyas founded on the practical<span class='page-number' id='s-501' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.501]</span> truth of our present natural existence, disappears in their biune entity, the dynamic mystery of the occult Supreme. The Truth-being is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hara-Gauri</span>[^1] of the Indian iconological symbol; it is the double Power masculine-feminine born from and supported by the supreme Shakti of the Supreme.\n\n[^1]: The biune <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of the Lord and his Spouse, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span> and Shakti, the right half male, the left half female.\n\nTherefore the truth-soul does not arrive at self-oblivion in the Infinite; it comes to an eternal self-possession in the Infinite. Its action is not irregular; it is a perfect control in an infinite freedom. In the lower planes the soul is naturally subject to Nature and the regulating principle is found in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span>; all regulation there depends on the acceptance of a strict subjection to the law of the finite. If the soul on these planes withdraws from that law into the liberty of the infinite, it loses its natural centre and becomes centreless in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> infinitude; it forfeits the living harmonic principle by which its external being was till then regulated and it finds no other. The personal nature or what is left of it merely continues mechanically for a while its past movements, or it dances in the gusts and falls of the universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> that acts on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> system rather than in that system, or it strays in the wild steps of an irresponsible ecstasy, or it remains inert and abandoned by the breath of the Spirit that was within it. If on the other hand the soul moves in its impulse of freedom towards the discovery of another and divine centre of control through which the Infinite can consciously govern its own action in the individual, it is moving towards the gnosis where that centre pre-exists, the centre of an eternal harmony and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>. It is when he ascends above mind and life to the gnosis that the Purusha becomes the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of his own nature because subject only to supreme Nature. For there <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> or will is the exact counterpart, the perfect dynamis of the divine knowledge. And that knowledge is not merely the eye of the Witness, it is the immanent and compelling gaze of the Ishwara. Its luminous governing power, a power not to be hedged in or denied, imposes its self-expressive force on all the<span class='page-number' id='s-502' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.502]</span> action and makes true and radiant and authentic and inevitable every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and impulse.\n\nThe gnosis does not reject the realisations of the lower planes; for it is not an annihilation or extinction, not a Nirvana but a sublime fulfilment of our manifested Nature. It possesses the first realisations under its own conditions after it has transformed them and made them <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of a divine order. The gnostic soul is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>, but the king-child;[^2] here is the royal and eternal childhood whose toys are the worlds and all universal Nature is the miraculous garden of the play that tires never. The gnosis takes up the condition of divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>; but this is no longer the inertia of the subject soul driven by Nature like a fallen leaf in the breath of the Lord. It is the happy passivity bearing an unimaginable intensity of action and Ananda of the Nature-Soul at once driven by the bliss of the mastering Purusha and aware of herself as the supreme Shakti above and around him and mastering and carrying him blissfully on her bosom for ever. This biune being of Purusha-Prakriti is as if a flaming Sun and body of divine Light self-carried in its orbit by its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner consciousness</span> and power at one with the universal, at one with a supreme Transcendence. Its madness is a wise madness of Ananda, the incalculable ecstasy of a supreme consciousness and power vibrating with an infinite sense of freedom and intensity in its divine life-movements. Its action is supra-rational and therefore to the rational mind which has not the key it seems a colossal madness. And yet this that seems madness is a wisdom in action that only baffles the mind by the liberty and richness of its contents and the infinite complexity in fundamental simplicity of its motions, it is the very method of the Lord of the worlds, a thing no intellectual interpretation can fathom,—a dance this also, a whirl of mighty energies, but the Master of the dance holds the hands of His energies and keeps them to the rhythmic order, the self-traced harmonic circles of his Rasa-lila. The gnostic soul is not bound any more than the divine demoniac by the petty conventions and proprieties of the<span class='page-number' id='s-503' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.503]</span> normal human life or the narrow rules through which it makes some shift to accommodate itself with the perplexing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dualities</span> of the lower nature and tries to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> its steps among the seeming <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contradictions</span> of the world, to avoid its numberless stumbling-blocks and to foot with gingerly care around its dangers and pitfalls. The gnostic supramental life is abnormal to us because it is free to all the hardihoods and audacious delights of a soul dealing fearlessly and even violently with Nature, but yet is it the very normality of the infinite and all governed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of the Truth</span> in its exact unerring process. It obeys the law of a self-possessed Knowledge, Love, Delight in an innumerable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Oneness</span>. It seems abnormal only because its rhythm is not measurable by the faltering beats of the mind, but yet it steps in a wonderful and transcendent measure.\n\n[^2]: So <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Heraclitus</span>, \"The kingdom is of the child.\"\n\nAnd what then is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a still higher step and what difference is there between the soul in gnosis and the soul in the Bliss? There is no essential difference, but yet a difference, because there is a transfer to another consciousness and a certain reversal in position,—for at each step of the ascent from Matter to the highest Existence there is a reversal of consciousness. The soul no longer looks up to something beyond it, but is in it and from it looks down on all that it was before. On all planes indeed the Ananda can be discovered, because everywhere it exists and is the same. Even there is a repetition of the Ananda plane in each lower world of consciousness. But in the lower planes not only is it reached by a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span> into it of the pure mind or the life-sense or the physical awareness, but it is, as it were, itself diluted by the dissolved form of mind, life or matter, held in the dilution and turned into a poor thinness wonderful to the lower consciousness but not comparable to its true intensities. The gnosis has on the contrary a dense light of essential consciousness[^3] in which the intense fullness of the Ananda can be. And when the form of gnosis is dissolved into the Ananda, it is not annulled altogether, but undergoes a natural change by which the soul is carried up into its last and absolute<span class='page-number' id='s-504' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.504]</span> freedom; for it casts itself into the absolute existence of the spirit and is enlarged into its own entirely self-existent bliss infinitudes. The gnosis has the infinite and absolute as the conscious source, accompaniment, condition, standard, field and atmosphere of all its activities, it possesses it as its base, fount, constituent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>, indwelling and inspiring Presence; but in its action it seems to stand out from it as its operation, as the rhythmical working of its activities, as a divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>[^4] or Wisdom-Formation of the Eternal. Gnosis is the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge-Will</span> of the divine Consciousness-Force; it is harmonic consciousness and action of Prakriti-Purusha full of the delight of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine existence</span>. In the Ananda the knowledge goes back from these willed harmonies into pure self-consciousness, the will dissolves into pure transcendent force and both are taken up into the pure delight of the Infinite. The basis of the gnostic existence is the self-stuff and self-form of the Ananda.\n\n[^3]: *cidghana.*\n\n[^4]: Not in the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, but in the original Vedic significance of the word Maya. All in the gnostic existence is real, spiritually concrete, eternally verifiable.\n\nThis in the ascension takes place because there is here completed the transition to the absolute unity of which the gnosis is the decisive step, but not the final resting-place. In the gnosis the soul is aware of its infinity and lives in it, yet it lives also in a working centre for the individual play of the Infinite. It realises its identity with all existences, but it keeps a distinction without difference by which it can have also the contact with them in a certain diverseness. This is that distinction for the joy of contact which in the mind becomes not only difference, but in its self-experience <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> from our other selves, in its spiritual being a sense of loss of self one with us in others and a reaching after the felicity it has forfeited, in life a compromise between egoistic self-absorption and a blind seeking out for the lost oneness. In its infinite consciousness, the gnostic soul creates a sort of voluntary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> for its own wisdom-purposes; it has even its particular luminous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aura</span> of being in which it moves, although beyond that it enters into all things and identifies itself with all being and all existences. In the Ananda all is reversed,<span class='page-number' id='s-505' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.505]</span> the centre disappears. In the bliss nature there is no centre, nor any voluntary or imposed circumference, but all is, all are one equal being, one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> spirit. The bliss soul finds and feels itself everywhere; it has no mansion, is *aniketa*, or has the all for its mansion, or, if it likes, it has all things for its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> mansions open to each other for ever. All other selves are entirely its own selves, in action as well as in essence. The joy of contact in diverse oneness becomes altogether the joy of absolute identity in innumerable oneness. Existence is no longer formulated in the terms of the Knowledge, because the known and knowledge and the knower are wholly one self here and, since all possesses all in an intimate identity beyond the closest closeness, there is no need of what we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> knowledge. All the consciousness is of the bliss of the Infinite, all power is power of the bliss of the Infinite, all forms and activities are forms and activities of the bliss of the Infinite. In this absolute truth of its being the eternal soul of Ananda lives, here deformed by contrary phenomena, there brought back and transfigured into their reality.\n\nThe soul lives: it is not abolished, it is not lost in a featureless Indefinite. For on every plane of our existence the same principle holds; the soul may fall asleep in a trance of self-absorption, dwell in an ineffable intensity of God-possession, live in the highest glory of its own plane,—the Anandaloka, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahmaloka</span>, Vaikuntha, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Goloka</span> of various Indian systems,—even turn upon the lower worlds to fill them with its own light and power and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beatitude</span>. In the eternal worlds and more and more in all worlds above Mind these states exist in each other. For they are not separate; they are coexistent, even coincident powers of the consciousness of the Absolute. The Divine on the Ananda plane is not incapable of a world-play or self-debarred from any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of its glories. On the contrary, as the Upanishad insists, the Ananda is the true creative principle. For all takes <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> from this divine Bliss;[^5] all is pre-existent in it as an absolute truth of existence which the Vijnana brings out and subjects to<span class='page-number' id='s-506' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.506]</span> voluntary limitation by the Idea and the law of the Idea. In the Ananda all law ceases and there is an absolute freedom without binding term or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span>. It is superior to all principles and in one and the same motion the enjoyer of all principles; it is free from all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gunas</span> and the enjoyer of its own infinite gunas; it is above all forms and the builder and enjoyer of all its self-forms and figures. This unimaginable completeness is what the spirit is, the spirit transcendent and universal, and to be one in bliss with the transcendent and universal spirit is for the soul too to be that and nothing less. Necessarily, since there is on this plane the absolute and the play of absolutes, it is ineffable by any of the conceptions of our mind or by signs of the phenomenal or ideal realities of which mind-conceptions are the figures in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>. These realities are themselves indeed only relative symbols of those ineffable absolutes. The symbol, the expressive reality, may give an idea, a perception, sense, vision, contact even of the thing itself to us, but at last we get beyond it to the thing it symbolises, transcend idea, vision, contact, pierce through the ideal and pass to the real realities, the identical, the supreme, the timeless and eternal, the infinitely infinite.\n\n[^5]: Therefore the world of the Ananda is called the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Janaloka</span>, in the double sense of birth and delight.\n\nOur first absorbing impulse when we become inwardly aware of something entirely beyond what we now are and know and are powerfully attracted to it, is to get away from the present actuality and dwell in that higher reality altogether. The extreme form of this attraction when we are drawn to the supreme Existence and the infinite Ananda is the condemnation of the lower and the finite as an illusion and an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> to Nirvana in the beyond,—the passion for dissolution, immersion, extinction in the Spirit. But the real dissolution, the true *nirvāṇa* is the release of all that is bindingly characteristic of the lower into the larger being of the Higher, the conscious possession of the living symbol by the living Real. We discover in the end that not only is that higher Reality the cause of all the rest, not only it embraces and exists in all the rest, but as more and more we possess it, all this rest is transformed in our soul-experience into a superior value and becomes the means of a richer expression of the Real, a more many-sided<span class='page-number' id='s-507' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.507]</span> communion with the Infinite, a larger ascent to the Supreme. Finally, we get close to the absolute and its supreme values which are the absolutes of all things. We lose the passion for release, *mumukṣutva*, which till then actuated us, because we are now intimately near to that which is ever free, that which is neither attracted into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attachment</span> by what binds us now nor afraid of what to us seems to be bondage. It is only by the loss of the bound soul's exclusive passion for its freedom that there can come an absolute liberation of our nature. The Divine attracts the soul of man to him by various lures; all of them are born of its own relative and imperfect conceptions of bliss; all are its ways of seeking for the Ananda, but, if clung to till the end, miss the inexpressible truth of those surpassing felicities. First in order comes the lure of an earthly reward, a prize of material, intellectual, ethical or other joy in the terrestrial mind and body. A second remoter greater version of the same fruitful error is the hope of a heavenly bliss, far exceeding these earthly rewards; the conception of heaven rises in altitude and purity till it reaches the pure idea of the eternal presence of God or an unending union with the Eternal. And last we get the subtlest of all lures, an escape from these worldly or heavenly joys and from all pains and sorrows, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and trouble and from all phenomenal things, a Nirvana, a self-dissolution in the Absolute, an Ananda of cessation and ineffable peace. In the end all these toys of the mind have to be transcended. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of birth and the desire of escape from birth must entirely fall away from us. For, to repeat the ancient language, the soul that has realised oneness has no sorrow or shrinking; the spirit that has entered into the bliss of the Spirit has nought to fear from anyone or anything whatsoever. Fear, desire and sorrow are diseases of the mind; born of its sense of division and limitation, they cease with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> that begot them. The Ananda is free from these maladies; it is not the monopoly of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>, it is not born from the disgust of existence.\n\nThe bliss soul is not bound to birth or to non-birth; it is not driven by desire of the Knowledge or harassed by fear of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ignorance</span>. The supreme bliss Soul has already the Knowledge<span class='page-number' id='s-508' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.508]</span> and transcends all need of knowledge. Not limited in consciousness by the form and the act, it can play with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> without being imbued with the Ignorance. Already it is taking its part above in the mystery of an eternal manifestation and here, when the time comes, it will descend into birth without being the slave of Ignorance chained to the revolutions of the wheel of Nature. For it knows that the purpose and law of the birth-series is for the soul in the body to rise from plane to plane and substitute always the rule of the higher for the rule of the lower play even down to the material field. The bliss-soul neither disdains to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> that ascent from above nor fears to descend down the stairs of God into the material birth and there contribute the power of its own bliss nature to the upward pull of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span></span>. The time for that marvellous hour of the evolving Time-Spirit is not yet come. Man, generally, cannot yet ascend to the bliss nature; he has first to secure himself on the higher mental altitudes, to ascend from them to the gnosis. Still less can he bring down all the Bliss-Power into this terrestrial Nature; he must first cease to be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental man</span> and become superhuman. All he can do now is to receive something of its power into his soul in greater or less degree, by a diminishing transmission through an inferior consciousness; but even that gives him the sense of an ecstasy and an unsurpassable beatitude.\n\nAnd what will be the bliss nature when it manifests in a new supramental race? The fully evolved soul will be one with all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> in the status and dynamic effects of experience of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss-consciousness</span> intense and illimitable. And since love is the effective power and soul-symbol of bliss-oneness he will approach and enter into this oneness by the gate of universal love, a sublimation of human love at first, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine love</span> afterwards, at its summits a thing of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span>, sweetness and splendour now to us inconceivable. He will be one in bliss-consciousness with all the world-play and its powers and happenings and there will be banished for ever the sorrow and fear, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hunger</span> and pain of our poor and darkened mental and vital and physical existence. He will get that power of the bliss-freedom in which all the conflicting principles of our being shall be unified in their<span class='page-number' id='s-509' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.509]</span> absolute values. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> shall perforce change itself into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>; the universal beauty of the All-beautiful will take possession of its fallen kingdoms; every darkness will be converted into a pregnant glory of light and the discords which the mind creates between Truth and Good and Beauty, Power and Love and Knowledge will disappear on the eternal summit, in the infinite extensions where they are always one.\n\nThe Purusha in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind, life and body</span> is divided from Nature and in conflict with her. He labours to control and coerce what he can embody of her by his masculine force and is yet subject to her afflicting dualities and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> her plaything from top to bottom, beginning to end. In the gnosis he is biune with her, finds as master of his own nature their reconciliation and harmony by their essential oneness even while he accepts an infinite blissful subjection, the condition of his mastery and his liberties, to the Supreme in his sovereign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Nature</span>. In the tops of the gnosis and in the Ananda he is one with the Prakriti and no longer solely biune with her. There is no longer the baffling play of Nature with the soul in the Ignorance; all is the conscious play of the soul with itself and all its selves and the Supreme and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Shakti</span> in its own and the infinite bliss nature. This is the supreme mystery, the highest secret, simple to its own experience, however difficult and complex to our mental conceptions and the effort of our limited intelligence to understand what is beyond it.

But not merely in some abstraction away from our present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, but here also; therefore to possess the Divine in himself, the Divine in the world, the Divine within, the Divine in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> things and all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>.

It is to possess God in his personality and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>impersonality</span>; in his purity free from qualities and in his infinite qualities; in time and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> time; in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and in his silence; in the finite and in the infinite. It is to possess him not only in pure self, but in all self; not only in self, but in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>; not only in spirit, but in supermind, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>; to possess him with the spirit, with the mind, with the vital and the physical consciousness; and it is again for all these to be possessed by him, so that our whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> with him, full of him, governed and driven by him. It is, since God is oneness, for our physical consciousness to be one with the soul and the nature of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> universe; for our life, to be one with all life; for our mind, to be one with the universal mind; for our spirit, to be identified with the universal spirit. It is to merge in him in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> and find him in all relations.\n\nSecondly, it is to put on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine being</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine nature</span>. And since God is Sachchidananda, it is to raise our<span class='page-number' id='s-511' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.511]</span> being into the divine being, our consciousness into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine consciousness</span>, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> into the divine energy, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of existence into the divine delight of being. And it is not only to lift ourselves into this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher consciousness</span>, but to widen into it in all our being, because it is to be found on all the planes of our existence and in all our members, so that our mental, vital, physical existence shall become full of the divine nature. Our intelligent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span> is to become a play of the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge-will</span>, our mental soul-life a play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span></span> and delight, our vitality a play of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine life</span>, our physical being a mould of the divine substance. This God-action in us is to be realised by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of ourselves to the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span> and divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span> and, in its fullness, by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> into and a permanent dwelling in the gnosis and the Ananda. For though we live physically on the material plane and in normal outward-going life the mind and soul are preoccupied with material existence, this externality of our being is not a binding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span>. We can raise our internal consciousness from plane to plane of the relations of Purusha with Prakriti, and even become, instead of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> dominated by the physical soul and nature, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnostic being</span> or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss-self</span> and assume the gnostic or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span> nature. And by this raising of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner life</span> we can transform our whole outward-going existence; instead of a life dominated by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> we shall then have a life dominated by spirit with all its circumstances moulded and determined by the purity of being, the consciousness infinite even in the finite, the divine energy, the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and bliss of the spirit.\n\nThis is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>; we have seen also what are the essentials of the method. But here we have first to consider briefly one side of the question of method which we have hitherto left untouched. In the system of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> the principle must be that all life is a part of the Yoga; but the knowledge which we have been describing seems to be not the knowledge of what is ordinarily understood as life, but of something behind life. There are two kinds of knowledge, that which seeks to understand the apparent phenomenon of existence externally, by an approach from outside, through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>,—this is the lower<span class='page-number' id='s-512' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.512]</span> knowledge, the knowledge of the apparent world; secondly, the knowledge which seeks to know the truth of existence from within, in its source and reality, by spiritual realisation. Ordinarily, a sharp distinction is drawn between the two, and it is supposed that when we get to the higher knowledge, the God-knowledge, then the rest, the world-knowledge, becomes of no concern to us: but in reality they are two sides of one seeking. All knowledge is ultimately the knowledge of God, through himself, through Nature, through her works. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mankind</span> has first to seek this knowledge through the external life; for until its mentality is sufficiently developed, spiritual knowledge is not really possible, and in proportion as it is developed, the possibilities of spiritual knowledge become richer and fuller.\n\nScience, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>, philosophy, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span>, psychology, the knowledge of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and his past, action itself are means by which we arrive at the knowledge of the workings of God through Nature and through life. At first it is the workings of life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of Nature which occupy us, but as we go deeper and deeper and get a completer view and experience, each of these lines brings us face to face with God. Science at its limits, even physical Science, is compelled to perceive in the end the infinite, the universal, the spirit, the divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> and will in the material universe. Still more easily must this be the end with the psychic sciences which deal with the operations of higher and subtler planes and powers of our being and come into contact with the beings and the phenomena of the worlds behind which are unseen, not sensible by our physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>, but ascertainable by the subtle mind and senses. Art leads to the same end; the aesthetic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> intensely preoccupied with Nature through aesthetic emotion must in the end arrive at spiritual emotion and perceive not only the infinite life, but the infinite presence within her; preoccupied with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> in the life of man he must in the end come to see the divine, the universal, the spiritual in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. Philosophy dealing with the principles of things must come to perceive the Principle of all these principles and investigate its nature, attributes and essential workings. So ethics must eventually perceive that the law of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> which it seeks is the law of God<span class='page-number' id='s-513' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.513]</span> and depends on the being and nature of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of the law. Psychology leads from the study of mind and the soul in living beings to the perception of the one soul and one mind in all things and beings. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> and study of man like the history and study of Nature lead towards the perception of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> and universal Power and Being whose thought and will work out through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> and human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>. Action itself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> us into contact with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Power</span> which works through, uses, overrules our actions. The intellect begins to perceive and understand, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> to feel and desire and revere, the will to turn itself to the service of the Divine without whom Nature and man cannot exist or move and by conscious knowledge of whom alone we can arrive at our highest possibilities.\n\nIt is here that Yoga steps in. It begins by using knowledge, emotion and action for the possession of the Divine. For Yoga is the conscious and perfect seeking of union with the Divine towards which all the rest was an ignorant and imperfect moving and seeking. At first, then, Yoga separates itself from the action and method of the lower knowledge. For while this lower knowledge approaches God indirectly from outside and never enters his secret dwelling-place, Yoga calls us within and approaches him directly; while that seeks him through the intellect and becomes conscious of him from behind a veil, Yoga seeks him through realisation, lifts the veil and gets the full vision; where that only feels the presence and the influence, Yoga enters into the presence and fills itself with the influence; where that is only aware of the workings and through them gets some glimpse of the Reality, Yoga identifies our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inner being</span> with the Reality and sees from that the workings. Therefore the methods of Yoga are different from the methods of the lower knowledge.\n\nThe method of Yoga in knowledge must always be a turning of the eye inward and, so far as it looks upon outer things, a penetrating of the surface appearances to get at the one eternal reality within them. The lower knowledge is preoccupied with the appearances and workings; it is the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of the higher to get away from them to the Reality of which they are the appearances and the Being and Power of conscious existence<span class='page-number' id='s-514' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.514]</span> of which they are the workings. It does this by three movements each necessary to each other, by each of which the others become complete,—purification, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span>, identification. The object of purification is to make the whole mental being a clear mirror in which the divine reality can be reflected, a clear vessel and an unobstructing channel into which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine presence</span> and through which the divine influence can be poured, a subtilised stuff which the divine nature can take possession of, new-shape and use to divine issues. For the mental being at present reflects only the confusions created by the mental and physical view of the world, is a channel only for the disorders of the ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lower nature</span> and full of obstructions and impurities which prevent the higher from acting; therefore the whole shape of our being is deformed and imperfect, indocile to the highest influences and turned in its action to ignorant and inferior utilities. It reflects even the world falsely; it is incapable of reflecting the Divine.\n\nConcentration is necessary, first, to turn the whole will and mind from the discursive divagation natural to them, following a dispersed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of the thoughts, running after many-branching <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>, led away in the track of the senses and the outward mental response to phenomena: we have to fix the will and the thought on the eternal and real behind all, and this demands an immense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, a one-pointed concentration. Secondly, it is necessary in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to break down the veil which is erected by our ordinary mentality between ourselves and the truth; for outer knowledge can be picked up by the way, by ordinary attention and reception, but the inner, hidden and higher truth can only be seized by an absolute concentration of the mind on its object, an absolute concentration of the will to attain it and, once attained, to hold it habitually and securely unite oneself with it. For identification is the condition of complete knowledge and possession; it is the intense result of a habitual purified reflecting of the reality and an entire concentration on it; and it is necessary in order to break down entirely that division and separation of ourselves from the divine being and the eternal reality which is the normal condition of our unregenerated ignorant mentality.<span class='page-number' id='s-515' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.515]</span>\n\nNone of these things can be done by the methods of the lower knowledge. It is true that here also they have a preparing action, but up to a certain point and to a certain degree of intensity only, and it is where their action ceases that the action of Yoga takes up our growth into the Divine and finds the means to complete it. All pursuit of knowledge, if not vitiated by a too earthward tendency, tends to refine, to subtilise, to purify the being. In proportion as we become more mental, we attain to a subtler action of our whole nature which becomes more apt to reflect and receive higher thoughts, a purer will, a less physical truth, more inward influences. The power of ethical knowledge and the ethical habit of thought and will to purify is obvious. Philosophy not only purifies the reason and predisposes it to the contact of the universal and the infinite, but tends to stabilise the nature and create the tranquillity of the sage; and tranquillity is a sign of increasing self-mastery and purity. The preoccupation with universal beauty even in its aesthetic forms has an intense power for refining and subtilising the nature, and at its highest it is a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> for purification. Even the scientific habit of mind and the disinterested preoccupation with cosmic law and truth not only refine the reasoning and observing faculty, but have, when not counteracted by other tendencies, a steadying, elevating and purifying influence on the mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>moral nature</span> which has not been sufficiently noticed.\n\nThe concentration of the mind and the training of the will towards the reception of the truth and living in the truth is also an evident result, a perpetual necessity of these pursuits; and at the end or in their highest intensities they may and do lead first to an intellectual, then to a reflective perception of the divine Reality which may culminate in a sort of preliminary identification with it. But all this cannot go beyond a certain point. The systematic purification of the whole being for an integral reflection and taking in of the divine reality can only be done by the special methods of Yoga. Its absolute concentration has to take the place of the dispersed concentrations of the lower knowledge; the vague and ineffective identification which is all the lower knowledge can bring, has to be replaced by<span class='page-number' id='s-516' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.516]</span> the complete, intimate, imperative and living union which Yoga brings.\n\nNevertheless, Yoga does not either in its path or in its attainment exclude and throw away the forms of the lower knowledge, except when it takes the shape of an extreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>asceticism</span> or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mysticism</span> altogether intolerant of this other divine mystery of the world-existence. It separates itself from them by the intensity, largeness and height of its objective and the specialisation of its methods to suit its aim; but it not only starts from them, but for a certain part of the way carries them with it and uses them as auxiliaries. Thus it is evident how largely ethical thought and practice,—not so much external as internal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>,—enter into the preparatory method of Yoga, into its aim at purity. Again the whole method of Yoga is psychological; it might almost be termed the consummate practice of a perfect psychological knowledge. The data of philosophy are the supports from which it begins in the realisation of God through the principles of his being; only it carries the intelligent understanding which is all philosophy gives, into an intensity which carries it beyond thought into vision and beyond understanding into realisation and possession; what philosophy leaves abstract and remote, it brings into a living nearness and spiritual concreteness. The aesthetic and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotional mind</span> and aesthetic forms are used by Yoga as a support for concentration even in the Yoga of knowledge and are, sublimated, the whole means of the Yoga of love and delight, as life and action, sublimated, are the whole means of the Yoga of works. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Contemplation</span> of God in Nature, contemplation and service of God in man and in the life of man and of the world in its past, present and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, are equally <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of which the Yoga of knowledge can make use to complete the realisation of God in all things. Only, all is directed to the one aim, directed towards God, filled with the idea of the divine, infinite, universal existence so that the outward-going, sensuous, pragmatical preoccupation of the lower knowledge with phenomena and forms is replaced by the one divine preoccupation. After attainment the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> remains. The Yogin continues to know and see God in the finite<span class='page-number' id='s-517' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.517]</span> and be a channel of God-consciousness and God-action in the world; therefore the knowledge of the world and the enlarging and uplifting of all that appertains to life comes within his scope. Only, in all he sees God, sees the supreme reality, and his motive of work is to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> mankind towards the knowledge of God and the possession of the supreme reality. He sees God through the data of science, God through the conclusions of philosophy, God through the forms of Beauty and the forms of Good, God in all the activities of life, God in the past of the world and its effects, in the present and its tendencies, in the future and its great progression. Into any or all of these he can bring his illumined vision and his liberated power of the spirit. The lower knowledge has been the step from which he has risen to the higher; the higher illumines for him the lower and makes it part of itself, even if only its lower fringe and most external radiation.<span class='page-number' id='s-518' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.518]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/the-higher-and-the-lower-knowledge","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Samadhi","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/samadhi","prvt":"Gnosis and Ananda","prvu":"/cwsa/23/gnosis-and-ananda","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["samadhi"],"t":"Samadhi","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Intimately connected with the aim of the Yoga of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Knowledge</span> which must always be the growth, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> or the withdrawal into a higher or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> not now normal to us, is the importance attached to the phenomenon of Yogic trance, to Samadhi.

What then is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of Samadhi or the utility of its trance in an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span>? It is evident that where our objective includes the possession of the Divine in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, a state of cessation of life cannot be the last consummating step or the highest desirable condition: Yogic trance cannot be an aim, as in so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> Yogic systems, but only a means, and a means not of escape from the waking existence, but to enlarge and raise the whole seeing, living and active consciousness.\n\nThe importance of Samadhi rests upon the truth which modern knowledge is rediscovering, but which has never been lost in Indian psychology, that only a small part whether of world-being or of our own being comes into our ken or into our action. The rest is hidden behind in subliminal reaches of being which descend into the profoundest depths of the subconscient and rise to highest peaks of superconscience, or which surround the little field of our waking self with a wide <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>circumconscient</span> existence<span class='page-number' id='s-519' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.519]</span> of which our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and sense catch only a few indications. The old Indian psychology expressed this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> by dividing consciousness into three provinces, waking state, dream-state, sleep-state, *jāgrat, svapna, suṣupti*; and it supposed in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> a waking self, a dream-self, a sleep-self, with the supreme or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> self of being, the fourth or Turiya, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span>, of which all these are derivations for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of relative experience in the world.\n\nIf we examine the phraseology of the old books, we shall find that the waking state is the consciousness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> universe which we normally possess in this embodied existence dominated by the physical mind. The dream-state is a consciousness corresponding to the subtler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-plane</span> and mind-plane behind, which to us, even when we get intimations of them, have not the same concrete reality as the things of the physical existence. The sleep-state is a consciousness corresponding to the supramental plane proper to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gnosis</span>, which is beyond our experience because our causal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> or envelope of gnosis is not developed in us, its faculties not active, and therefore we are in relation to that plane in a condition of dreamless sleep. The Turiya beyond is the consciousness of our pure self-existence or our absolute being with which we have no direct relations at all, whatever mental reflections we may receive in our dream or our waking or even, irrecoverably, in our sleep consciousness. This fourfold scale corresponds to the degrees of the ladder of being by which we climb back towards the absolute Divine. Normally therefore we cannot get back from the physical mind to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span> or degrees of consciousness without receding from the waking state, without going in and away from it and losing touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material world</span>. Hence to those who desire to have the experience of these higher degrees, trance becomes a desirable thing, a means of escape from the limitations of the physical mind and nature.\n\nSamadhi or Yogic trance retires to increasing depths according as it draws farther and farther away from the normal or waking state and enters into degrees of consciousness less and less communicable to the waking mind, less and less ready to<span class='page-number' id='s-520' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.520]</span> receive a summons from the waking world. Beyond a certain point the trance becomes complete and it is then almost or quite impossible to awaken or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> back the soul that has receded into them; it can only come back by its own will or at most by a violent shock of physical appeal dangerous to the system owing to the abrupt upheaval of return. There are said to be supreme states of trance in which the soul persisting for too long a time cannot return; for it loses its hold on the cord which binds it to the consciousness of life, and the body is left, maintained indeed in its set position, not dead by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span>, but incapable of recovering the ensouled life which had inhabited it. Finally, the Yogin acquires at a certain stage of development the power of abandoning his body definitively without the ordinary phenomena of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, by an act of will,[^1] or by a process of withdrawing the pranic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-force</span> through the gate of the upward life-current (*udāna*), <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> for it a way through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> *brahmarandhra* in the head. By departure from life in the state of Samadhi he attains directly to that higher status of being to which he aspires.\n\n[^1]: *icchā-mṛtyu.*\n\nIn the dream-state itself there are an infinite series of depths; from the lighter recall is easy and the world of the physical senses is at the doors, though for the moment shut out; in the deeper it becomes remote and less able to break in upon the inner absorption, the mind has entered into secure depths of trance. There is a complete difference between Samadhi and normal sleep, between the dream-state of Yoga and the physical state of dream. The latter belongs to the physical mind; in the former the mind proper and subtle is at work liberated from the immixture of the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span> of the physical mind are an incoherent jumble made up partly of responses to vague touches from the physical world round which the lower mind-faculties disconnected from the will and reason, the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>buddhi</span>*, weave a web of wandering phantasy, partly of disordered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> from the brain-memory, partly of reflections from the soul travelling on the mental plane, reflections which are, ordinarily, received<span class='page-number' id='s-521' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.521]</span> without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> or coordination, wildly distorted in the reception and mixed up confusedly with the other dream <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>, with brain-memories and fantastic responses to any sensory touch from the physical world. In the Yogic dream-state, on the other hand, the mind is in clear possession of itself, though not of the physical world, works coherently and is able to use either its ordinary will and intelligence with a concentrated power or else the higher will and intelligence of the more exalted planes of mind. It withdraws from experience of the outer world, it puts its seals upon the physical senses and their doors of communication with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material things</span>; but everything that is proper to itself, thought, reasoning, reflection, vision, it can continue to execute with an increased purity and power of sovereign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> free from the distractions and unsteadiness of the waking mind. It can use too its will and produce upon itself or upon its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> mental, moral and even physical effects which may continue and have their after consequences on the waking state subsequent to the cessation of the trance.\n\nTo arrive at full possession of the powers of the dream-state, it is necessary first to exclude the attack of the sights, sounds etc. of the outer world upon the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>. It is quite possible indeed to be aware in the dream-trance of the outer physical world through the subtle senses which belong to the subtle body; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> may be aware of them just so far as one chooses and on a much wider scale than in the waking condition: for the subtle senses have a far more powerful range than the gross physical organs, a range which may be made practically unlimited. But this awareness of the physical world through the subtle senses is something quite different from our normal awareness of it through the physical organs; the latter is incompatible with the settled state of trance, for the pressure of the physical senses breaks the Samadhi and calls back the mind to live in their normal field where alone they have power. But the subtle senses have power both upon their own planes and upon the physical world, though this is to them more remote than their own world of being. In Yoga various devices are used to seal up the doors of the physical sense, some of them physical devices; but the one all sufficient<span class='page-number' id='s-522' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.522]</span> means is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of concentration by which the mind is drawn inward to depths where the call of physical things can no longer easily attain to it. A second <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> is to get rid of the intervention of physical sleep. The ordinary habit of the mind when it goes in away from contact with physical things is to fall into the torpor of sleep or its dreams, and therefore when called in for the purposes of Samadhi, it gives or tends to give, at the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span>, by sheer force of habit, not the response demanded, but its usual response of physical slumber. This habit of the mind has to be got rid of; the mind has to learn to be awake in the dream-state, in possession of itself, not with the outgoing, but with an ingathered wakefulness in which, though immersed in itself, it exercises all its powers.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> of the dream-state are infinitely various. For not only has it sovereign possession of the usual mental powers, reasoning, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discrimination</span>, will, imagination, and can use them in whatever way, on whatever subject, for whatever purpose it pleases, but it is able to establish connection with all the worlds to which it has natural access or to which it chooses to acquire access, from the physical to the higher mental worlds. This it does by various means open to the subtlety, flexibility and comprehensive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of this internalised mind liberated from the narrow limitations of the physical outward-going senses. It is able first to take cognizance of all things whether in the material world or upon other planes by aid of perceptible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span>, not only images of things visible, but of sounds, touch, smell, taste, movement, action, of all that makes itself sensible to the mind and its organs. For the mind in Samadhi has access to the inner space called sometimes the *cidākāśa*, to depths of more and more subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ether</span> which are heavily curtained from the physical sense by the grosser ether of the material universe, and all things sensible, whether in the material world or any other, create reconstituting vibrations, sensible echoes, reproductions, recurrent images of themselves which that subtler ether receives and retains.\n\nIt is this which explains many of the phenomena of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clairvoyance</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clairaudience</span>, etc.; for these phenomena are only the exceptional admission of the waking mentality into a limited<span class='page-number' id='s-523' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.523]</span> sensitiveness to what might be called the image <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> of the subtle ether, by which not only the signs of all things past and present, but even those of things <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> can be seized; for things future are already accomplished to knowledge and vision on higher planes of mind and their images can be reflected upon mind in the present. But these things which are exceptional to the waking mentality, difficult and to be perceived only by the possession of a special power or else after assiduous training, are natural to the dream-state of trance consciousness in which the subliminal mind is free. And that mind can also take cognizance of things on various planes not only by these sensible images, but by a species of thought perception or of thought reception and impression analogous to that phenomenon of consciousness which in modern psychical science has been given the name of telepathy. But the powers of the dream-state do not end here. It can by a sort of projection of ourselves, in a subtle form of the mental body, actually enter into other planes and worlds or into distant places and scenes of this world, move among them with a sort of bodily presence and bring back the direct experience of their scenes and truths and occurrences. It may even project actually the mental or vital body for the same purpose and travel in it, leaving the physical body in a profoundest trance without sign of life until its return.\n\nThe greatest value of the dream-state of Samadhi lies, however, not in these more outward things, but in its power to open up easily higher ranges and powers of thought, emotion, will by which the soul grows in height, range and self-mastery. Especially, withdrawing from the distraction of sensible things, it can, in a perfect power of concentrated self-seclusion, prepare itself by a free reasoning, thought, discrimination, or more intimately, more finally, by an ever deeper vision and identification, for access to the Divine, the supreme Self, the transcendent Truth, both in its principles and powers and manifestations and in its highest original Being. Or it can by an absorbed inner <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and emotion, as in a sealed and secluded chamber of the soul, prepare itself for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of union with the divine Beloved, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, rapture and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ananda</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-524' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.524]</span>\n\nFor the integral Yoga this method of Samadhi may seem to have the disadvantage that when it ceases, the thread is broken and the soul returns into the distraction and imperfection of the outward life, with only such an elevating effect upon that outer life as the general memory of these deeper experiences may produce. But this gulf, this break is not inevitable. In the first place, it is only in the untrained psychic being that the experiences of the trance are a blank to the waking mind; as it becomes the master of its Samadhi, it is able to pass without any gulf of oblivion from the inner to the outer waking. Secondly, when this has been once done, what is attained in the inner state, becomes easier to acquire by the waking consciousness and to turn into the normal experience, powers, mental status of the waking life. The subtle mind which is normally eclipsed by the insistence of the physical being, becomes powerful even in the waking state, until even there the enlarging <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is able to live in his several subtle bodies as well as in his physical body, to be aware of them and in them, to use their senses, faculties, powers, to dwell in possession of supraphysical truth, consciousness and experience.\n\nThe sleep-state ascends to a higher power of being, beyond thought into pure consciousness, beyond emotion into pure bliss, beyond will into pure mastery; it is the gate of union with the supreme state of Sachchidananda out of which all the activities of the world are born. But here we must take care to avoid the pitfalls of symbolic language. The use of the words dream and sleep for these higher states is nothing but an image drawn from the experience of the normal physical mind with regard to planes in which it is not at home. It is not the truth that the Self in the third status called perfect sleep, *suṣupti*, is in a state of slumber. The sleep self is on the contrary described as Prajna, the Master of Wisdom and Knowledge, Self of the Gnosis, and as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ishwara</span>, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> of being. To the physical mind a sleep, it is to our wider and subtler consciousness a greater waking. To the normal mind all that exceeds its normal experience but still comes into its scope, seems a dream; but at the point where it borders on things quite beyond its scope, it can no longer see truth even as<span class='page-number' id='s-525' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.525]</span> in a dream, but passes into the blank incomprehension and non-reception of slumber. This border-line varies with the power of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> consciousness, with the degree and height of its enlightenment and awakening. The line may be pushed up higher and higher until it may pass even beyond the mind. Normally indeed the human mind cannot be awake, even with the inner waking of trance, on the supramental levels; but this disability can be overcome. Awake on these levels the soul becomes master of the ranges of gnostic thought, gnostic will, gnostic delight, and if it can do this in Samadhi, it may carry its memory of experience and its power of experience over into the waking state. Even on the yet higher level open to us, that of the Ananda, the awakened soul may become similarly possessed of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bliss-Self</span> both in its concentration and in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> comprehension. But still there may be ranges above from which it can bring back no memory except that which says, \"somehow, indescribably, I was in bliss,\" the bliss of an unconditioned existence beyond all potentiality of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> by thought or description by image or feature. Even the sense of being may disappear in an experience in which the word existence loses its sense and the Buddhistic symbol of Nirvana seems alone and sovereignly justified. However high the power of awakening goes, there seems to be a beyond in which the image of sleep, of *suṣupti*, will still find its application.\n\nSuch is the principle of the Yogic trance, Samadhi,—into its complex phenomena we need not now enter. It is sufficient to note its double utility in the integral Yoga. It is true that up to a point difficult to define or delimit almost all that Samadhi can give, can be acquired without recourse to Samadhi. But still there are certain heights of spiritual and psychic experience of which the direct as opposed to a reflecting experience can only be acquired deeply and in its fullness by means of the Yogic trance. And even for that which can be otherwise acquired, it offers a ready means, a facility which becomes more helpful, if not indispensable, the higher and more difficult of access become the planes on which the heightened spiritual experience is sought.

Samadhi, as we have seen, offers itself as the natural status of such a higher level and greater intensity. It assumes naturally a great importance in the Yoga of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, because there it is the very principle of its method and its object to raise the mental consciousness into a clarity and concentrated power by which it can become entirely aware of, lost in, identified with true being. But there are two great disciplines in which it becomes of an even greater importance. To these two systems, to Rajayoga and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hathayoga</span>, we may as well now turn; for in spite of the wide difference of their methods from that of the path of knowledge, they have this same principle as their final justification. At the same time, it will not be necessary for us to do more than regard the spirit of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gradations</span> in passing; for in a synthetic and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> they take a secondary importance; their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> have indeed to be included, but their methods can either altogether<span class='page-number' id='s-528' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.528]</span> be dispensed with or used only for a preliminary or else a casual assistance.\n\nHathayoga is a powerful, but difficult and onerous system whose whole principle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> is founded on an intimate connection between the body and the soul. The body is the key, the body the secret both of bondage and of release, of animal weakness and of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine power</span>, of the obscuration of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and soul and of their illumination, of subjection to pain and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limitation</span> and of self-mastery, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> and of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. The body is not to the Hathayogin a mere mass of living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> bridge between the spiritual and the physical being; one has even seen an ingenious exegete of the Hathayogic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> explain the Vedantic symbol <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>OM</span> as a figure of this mystic human body. Although, however, he speaks always of the physical body and makes that the basis of his practices, he does not view it with the eye of the anatomist or physiologist, but describes and explains it in language which always looks back to the subtle body behind the physical system. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> the whole aim of the Hathayogin may be summarised from our point of view, though he would not himself put it in that language, as an attempt by fixed scientific processes to give to the soul in the physical body the power, the light, the purity, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, the ascending scales of spiritual experience which would naturally be open to it, if it dwelt here in the subtle and the developed causal vehicle.\n\nTo speak of the processes of Hathayoga as scientific may seem strange to those who associate the idea of science only with the superficial phenomena of the physical universe apart from all that is behind them; but they are equally based on definite experience of laws and their workings and give, when rightly practised, their well-tested results. In fact, Hathayoga is, in its own way, a system of knowledge; but while the proper Yoga of knowledge is a philosophy of being put into spiritual practice, a psychological system, this is a science of being, a psycho-physical system. Both produce physical, psychic and spiritual results; but because they stand at different poles of the same truth, to one the psycho-physical results are of small importance, the pure psychic and spiritual alone matter, and even the pure psychic are only<span class='page-number' id='s-529' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.529]</span> accessories of the spiritual which absorb all the attention; in the other the physical is of immense importance, the psychical a considerable fruit, the spiritual the highest and consummating result, but it seems for a long time a thing postponed and remote, so great and absorbing is the attention which the body demands. It must not be forgotten, however, that both do arrive at the same end. Hathayoga, also, is a path, though by a long, difficult and meticulous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, *duḥkham āptum*, to the Supreme.\n\nAll Yoga proceeds in its method by three principles of practice; first, purification, that is to say, the removal of all aberrations, disorders, obstructions brought about by the mixed and irregular action of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of being in our physical, moral and mental system; secondly, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span>, that is to say, the bringing to its full intensity and the mastered and self-directed employment of that energy of being in us for a definite end; thirdly, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>, that is to say, the release of our being from the narrow and painful knots of the individualised energy in a false and limited play, which at present are the law of our nature. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>enjoyment</span> of our liberated being which brings us into unity or union with the Supreme, is the consummation; it is that for which Yoga is done. Three indispensable steps and the high, open and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> levels to which they mount; and in all its practice Hathayoga keeps these in view.\n\nThe two main members of its physical discipline, to which the others are mere accessories, are *āsana*, the habituating of the body to certain attitudes of immobility, and *prāṇāyāma*, the regulated direction and arrestation by exercises of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>breathing</span> of the vital currents of energy in the body. The physical being is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>; but the physical being is made up of two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span>, the physical and the vital, the body which is the apparent instrument and the basis, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> energy, *prāṇa*, which is the power and the real instrument. Both of these instruments are now our masters. We are subject to the body, we are subject to the life energy; it is only in a very limited degree that we can, though souls, though mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>, at all pose as their masters. We are bound by a poor and limited physical nature, we are bound consequently by a poor and limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-power</span> which is all that<span class='page-number' id='s-530' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.530]</span> the body can bear or to which it can give scope. Moreover, the action of each and both in us is subject not only to the narrowest limitations, but to a constant impurity, which renews itself every time it is rectified, and to all sorts of disorders, some of which are normal, a violent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, part of our ordinary physical life, others abnormal, its maladies and disturbances. With all this Hathayoga has to deal; all this it has to overcome; and it does it mainly by these two methods, complex and cumbrous in action, but simple in principle and effective.\n\nThe Hathayogic system of Asana has at its basis two profound ideas which bring with them many effective implications. The first is that of control by physical immobility, the second is that of power by immobility. The power of physical immobility is as important in Hathayoga as the power of mental immobility in the Yoga of knowledge, and for parallel reasons. To the mind unaccustomed to the deeper truths of our being and nature they would both seem to be a seeking after the listless passivity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>. The direct contrary is the truth; for Yogic passivity, whether of mind or body, is a condition of the greatest increase, possession and continence of energy. The normal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of our minds is for the most part a disordered restlessness, full of waste and rapidly tentative expenditure of energy in which only a little is selected for the workings of the self-mastering will,—waste, be it understood, from this point of view, not that of universal Nature in which what is to us waste, serves the purposes of her economy. The activity of our bodies is a similar restlessness.\n\nIt is the sign of a constant inability of the body to hold even the limited life energy that enters into or is generated in it, and consequently of a general dissipation of this Pranic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> with a quite subordinate element of ordered and well-economised activity. Moreover in the consequent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>interchange</span> and balancing between the movement and interaction of the vital energies normally at work in the body and their interchange with those which act upon it from outside, whether the energies of others or of the general Pranic force variously active in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>, there is a constant precarious balancing and adjustment which may at any moment go wrong. Every obstruction, every defect, every<span class='page-number' id='s-531' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.531]</span> excess, every lesion creates impurities and disorders. Nature manages it all well enough for her own purposes, when left to herself; but the moment the blundering mind and will of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> interfere with her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> and her vital <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span> and intuitions, especially when they create false or artificial habits, a still more precarious order and frequent derangement become the rule of the being. Yet this interference is inevitable, since <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> lives not for the purposes of the vital Nature in him alone, but for higher purposes which she had not contemplated in her first balance and to which she has with difficulty to adjust her operations. Therefore the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a greater status or action is to get rid of this disordered restlessness, to still the activity and to regulate it. The Hathayogin has to bring about an abnormal poise of status and action of the body and the life energy, abnormal not in the direction of greater disorder, but of superiority and self-mastery.\n\nThe first object of the immobility of the Asana is to get rid of the restlessness imposed on the body and to force it to hold the Pranic energy instead of dissipating and squandering it. The experience in the practice of Asana is not that of a cessation and diminution of energy by inertia, but of a great increase, inpouring, circulation of force. The body, accustomed to work off superfluous energy by movement, is at first ill able to bear this increase and this retained inner action and betrays it by violent tremblings; afterwards it habituates itself and, when the Asana is conquered, then it finds as much ease in the posture, however originally difficult or unusual to it, as in its easiest attitudes sedentary or recumbent. It becomes increasingly capable of holding whatever amount of increased vital energy is brought to bear upon it without needing to spill it out in movement, and this increase is so enormous as to seem illimitable, so that the body of the perfected Hathayogin is capable of feats of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span>, force, unfatigued expenditure of energy of which the normal physical powers of man at their highest would be incapable. For it is not only able to hold and retain this energy, but to bear its possession of the physical system and its more complete movement through it. The life energy, thus occupying<span class='page-number' id='s-532' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.532]</span> and operating in a powerful, unified movement on the tranquil and passive body, freed from the restless balancing between the continent power and the contained, becomes a much greater and more effective force. In fact, it seems then rather to contain and possess and use the body than to be contained, possessed and used by it,—just as the restless active mind seems to seize on and use irregularly and imperfectly whatever spiritual force comes into it, but the tranquillised mind is held, possessed and used by the spiritual force.\n\nThe body, thus liberated from itself, purified from many of its disorders and irregularities, becomes, partly by Asana, completely by combined Asana and Pranayama, a perfected instrument. It is freed from its ready liability to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fatigue</span>; it acquires an immense power of health; its tendencies of decay, age and death are arrested. The Hathayogin even at an age advanced <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the ordinary span maintains the unimpaired vigour, health and youth of the life in the body; even the appearance of physical youth is sustained for a longer time. He has a much greater power of longevity, and from his point of view, the body being the instrument, it is a matter of no small importance to preserve it long and to keep it for all that time free from impairing deficiencies. It is to be observed, also, that there are an enormous variety of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asanas</span> in Hathayoga, running in their fullness beyond the number of eighty, some of them of the most complicated and difficult <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. This variety serves partly to increase the results already noted, as well as to give a greater freedom and flexibility to the use of the body, but it serves also to alter the relation of the physical energy in the body to the earth energy with which it is related. The lightening of the heavy hold of the latter, of which the overcoming of fatigue is the first sign and the phenomenon of *utthāpana* or partial levitation the last, is one result. The gross body begins to acquire something of the nature of the subtle body and to possess something of its relations with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life-energy</span>; that becomes a greater force more powerfully felt and yet capable of a lighter and freer and more resolvable physical action, powers which culminate in the Hathayogic *siddhis* or extraordinary powers of *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>garimā</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mahimā</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aṇimā</span>* and *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>laghimā</span>*.<span class='page-number' id='s-533' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.533]</span> Moreover, the life ceases to be entirely dependent on the action of the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> and functionings, such as the heart-beats and the breathing. These can in the end be suspended without cessation of or lesion to the life.\n\nAll this, however, the result in its perfection of Asana and Pranayama, is only a basic physical power and freedom. The higher use of Hathayoga depends more intimately on Pranayama. Asana deals more directly with the more <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> part of the physical totality, though here too it needs the aid of the other; Pranayama, starting from the physical immobility and self-holding which is secured by Asana, deals more directly with the subtler vital parts, the nervous system. This is done by various regulations of the breathing, starting from equality of respiration and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and extending to the most diverse rhythmic regulations of both with an interval of inholding of the breath. In the end the keeping in of the breath, which has first to be done with some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, and even its cessation become as easy and seem as natural as the constant taking in and throwing out which is its normal action. But the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of the Pranayama are to purify the nervous system, to circulate the life-energy through all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> without obstruction, disorder or irregularity, and to acquire a complete control of its functionings, so that the mind and will of the soul inhabiting the body may be no longer subject to the body or life or their combined limitations. The power of these exercises of breathing to bring about a purified and unobstructed state of the nervous system is a known and well-established fact of our physiology. It helps also to clear the physical system, but is not entirely effective at first on all its canals and openings; therefore the Hathayogin uses supplementary physical methods for clearing them out regularly of all their accumulations. The combination of these with Asana,—particular Asanas have even an effect in destroying particular diseases,—and with Pranayama maintains perfectly the health of the body. But the principal gain is that by this purification the vital energy can be directed anywhere, to any part of the body and in any way or with any rhythm of its movement.\n\nThe mere function of breathing into and out of the lungs is<span class='page-number' id='s-534' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.534]</span> only the most sensible, outward and seizable movement of the Prana, the Breath of Life in our physical system. The Prana has according to Yogic science a fivefold movement pervading all the nervous system and the whole material body and determining all its functionings. The Hathayogin seizes on the outward movement of respiration as a sort of key which opens to him the control of all these five powers of the Prana. He becomes sensibly aware of their inner operations, mentally conscious of his whole physical life and action. He is able to direct the Prana through all the *nāḍīs* or nerve-channels of his system. He becomes aware of its action in the six *cakras* or ganglionic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of the nervous system, and is able to open it up in each beyond its present limited, habitual and mechanical workings. He gets, in short, a perfect control of the life in the body in its most subtle nervous as well as in its grossest physical aspects, even over that in it which is at present involuntary and out of the reach of our observing consciousness and will. Thus a complete mastery of the body and the life and a free and effective use of them established upon a purification of their workings is founded as a basis for the higher aims of Hathayoga.\n\nAll this, however, is still a mere basis, the outward and inward physical conditions of the two instruments used by Hathayoga. There still remains the more important matter of the psychical and spiritual effects to which they can be turned. This depends on the connection between the body and the mind and spirit and between the gross and the subtle body on which the system of Hathayoga takes its stand. Here it comes into line with Rajayoga, and a point is reached at which a transition from the one to the other can be made.<span class='page-number' id='s-535' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.535]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/hathayoga","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"nxtt":"Rajayoga","nxtu":"/cwsa/23/rajayoga","prvt":"Samadhi","prvu":"/cwsa/23/samadhi","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["rajayoga"],"t":"Rajayoga","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"As the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and the Prana are the key of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the closed doors of the Yoga for the Hathayogin, so is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> the key in Rajayoga. But since in both the dependence of the mind on the body and the Prana is admitted, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hathayoga</span> totally, in the established system of Rajayoga partially, therefore in both systems the practice of Asana and Pranayama is included; but in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> they occupy the whole field, in the other each is limited only to one simple process and in their unison they are intended to serve only a limited and intermediate office.

Modern Science and psychology have even held, for a time, this dependence to be in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span>; they have tried to establish that there is no such separate entity as mind or soul and that all mental operations are in reality physical functionings. Even otherwise, apart from this untenable hypothesis, the dependence is so exaggerated that it has been supposed to be an altogether binding condition, and any such thing as the control of the vital and bodily functionings by the mind or its power to detach itself from them has long been treated as an error, a morbid state of the mind or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hallucination</span>. Therefore the dependence has remained <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span>, and Science neither finds nor seeks for the real key of the dependence and therefore can discover for us no secret of release and mastery.\n\nThe psycho-physical science of Yoga does not make this mistake. It seeks for the key, finds it and is able to effect the release; for it takes account of the psychical or mental body behind of which the physical is a sort of reproduction in gross form, and is able to discover thereby secrets of the physical body<span class='page-number' id='s-536' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.536]</span> which do not appear to a purely physical enquiry. This mental or psychical body, which the soul keeps even after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, has also a subtle pranic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> in it corresponding to its own subtle nature and substance,—for wherever there is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of any kind, there must be the pranic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and a substance in which it can work,—and this force is directed through a system of numerous channels, called *nāḍī*,—the subtle nervous organisation of the psychic body,—which are gathered up into six (or really seven) <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> called technically <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lotuses</span> or circles, *cakra*, and which rise in an ascending scale to the summit where there is the thousand-petalled lotus from which all the mental and vital energy flows. Each of these lotuses is the centre and the storing-house of its own particular system of psychological powers, energies and operations,—each system corresponding to a plane of our psychological <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>,—and these flow out and return in the stream of the pranic energies as they course through the *nāḍīs*.\n\nThis arrangement of the psychic body is reproduced in the physical with the spinal column as a rod and the ganglionic centres as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chakras</span> which rise up from the bottom of the column, where the lowest is attached, to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> and find their summit in the *brahmarandhra* at the top of the skull. These chakras or lotuses, however, are in physical man closed or only partly open, with the consequence that only such powers and only so much of them are active in him as are sufficient for his ordinary physical life, and so much mind and soul only is at play as will accord with its need. This is the real reason, looked at from the mechanical point of view, why the embodied soul seems so dependent on the bodily and nervous life,—though the dependence is neither so complete nor so real as it seems. The whole energy of the soul is not at play in the physical body and life, the secret powers of mind are not awake in it, the bodily and nervous energies predominate. But all the while the supreme energy is there, asleep; it is said to be coiled up and slumbering like a snake,—therefore it is called the *kuṇḍalinī śakti*,—in the lowest of the chakras, in the *mūlādhāra*. When by Pranayama the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> between the upper and lower prana currents in the body is dissolved, this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kundalini</span> is struck and<span class='page-number' id='s-537' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.537]</span> awakened, it uncoils itself and begins to rise upward like a fiery serpent breaking open each lotus as it ascends until the Shakti meets the Purusha in the *brahmarandhra* in a deep samadhi of union.\n\nPut less symbolically, in more philosophical though perhaps less profound language, this means that the real energy of our being is lying asleep and inconscient in the depths of our vital system, and is awakened by the practice of Pranayama. In its expansion it opens up all the centres of our psychological being in which reside the powers and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of what would now be called perhaps our subliminal self; therefore as each centre of power and consciousness is opened up, we get access to successive psychological planes and are able to put ourselves in communication with the worlds or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cosmic</span> states of being which correspond to them; all the psychic powers abnormal to physical man, but natural to the soul develop in us. Finally, at the summit of the ascension, this arising and expanding energy meets with the superconscient self which sits concealed behind and above our physical and mental existence; this meeting leads to a profound samadhi of union in which our waking consciousness loses itself in the superconscient. Thus by the thorough and unremitting practice of Pranayama the Hathayogin attains in his own way the psychic and spiritual results which are pursued through more directly psychical and spiritual methods in other Yogas. The one mental aid which he conjoins with it, is the use of the mantra, sacred syllable, name or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> formula which is of so much importance in the Indian systems of Yoga and common to them all. This secret of the power of the mantra, the six chakras and the Kundalini Shakti is one of the central truths of all that complex psycho-physical science and practice of which the Tantric philosophy claims to give us a rationale and the most complete compendium of methods. All religions and disciplines in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> which use largely the psycho-physical method, depend more or less upon it for their practices.\n\nRajayoga also uses the Pranayama and for the same principal psychic purposes as the Hathayoga, but being in its whole principle a psychical system, it employs it only as one stage<span class='page-number' id='s-538' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.538]</span> in the series of its practices and to a very limited extent, for three or four large utilities. It does not start with Asana and Pranayama, but insists first on a moral purification of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mentality</span>. This preliminary is of supreme importance; without it the course of the rest of the Rajayoga is likely to be troubled, marred and full of unexpected mental, moral and physical perils.[^1] This moral purification is divided in the established system under two heads, five *yamas* and five *niyamas*. The first are rules of moral self-control in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> such as truth-speaking, abstinence from injury or killing, from theft etc.; but in reality these must be regarded as merely certain main indications of the general need of moral self-control and purity. *Yama* is, more largely, any self-discipline by which the rajasic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>egoism</span> and its passions and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human being</span> are conquered and quieted into perfect cessation. The object is to create a moral <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, a void of the passions, and so prepare for the death of egoism in the rajasic human being. The *niyamas* are equally a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of the mind by regular practices of which the highest is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>meditation</span> on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> Being, and their object is to create a sattwic calm, purity and preparation for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>concentration</span> upon which the secure pursuance of the rest of the Yoga can be founded.\n\n[^1]: In modern India people attracted to Yoga, but picking up its processes from books or from persons only slightly acquainted with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, often plunge straight into Pranayama of Rajayoga, frequently with disastrous results. Only the very strong in spirit can afford to make mistakes in this path.\n\nIt is here, when this foundation has been secured, that the practice of Asana and Pranayama come in and can then bear their perfect fruits. By itself the control of the mind and moral being only puts our normal consciousness into the right preliminary condition; it cannot bring about that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of the higher psychic being which is necessary for the greater <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> of Yoga. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to bring about this manifestation the present nodus of the vital and physical body with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental being</span> has to be loosened and the way made clear for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascent</span> through the greater psychic being to the union with the superconscient Purusha. This can be done by Pranayama.<span class='page-number' id='s-539' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.539]</span>\n\nAsana is used by the Rajayoga only in its easiest and most natural position, that naturally taken by the body when seated and gathered together, but with the back and head strictly erect and in a straight line, so that there may be no deflection of the spinal cord. The object of the latter rule is obviously connected with the theory of the six chakras and the circulation of the vital energy between the *mūlādhāra* and the *brahmarandhra*. The Rajayogic Pranayama purifies and clears the nervous system; it enables us to circulate the vital energy equally through the body and direct it also where we will according to need, and thus maintain a perfect health and soundness of the body and the vital being; it gives us control of all the five habitual operations of the vital energy in the system and at the same time breaks down the habitual divisions by which only the ordinary mechanical processes of the vitality are possible to the normal life. It opens entirely the six centres of the psycho-physical system and brings into the waking consciousness the power of the awakened Shakti and the light of the unveiled Purusha on each of the ascending planes. Coupled with the use of the mantra it brings the divine energy into the body and prepares for and facilitates that concentration in Samadhi which is the crown of the Rajayogic method.\n\nRajayogic concentration is divided into four stages; it commences with the drawing both of the mind and senses from outward things, proceeds to the holding of the one object of concentration to the exclusion of all other ideas and mental activities, then to the prolonged absorption of the mind in this object, finally, to the complete ingoing of the consciousness by which it is lost to all outward mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oneness</span> of Samadhi. The real object of this mental discipline is to draw away the mind from the outward and the mental world into union with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine Being</span>. Therefore in the first three stages use has to be made of some mental means or support by which the mind, accustomed to run about from object to object, shall fix on one alone, and that one must be something which represents the idea of the Divine. It is usually a name or a form or a mantra by which the thought can be fixed in the sole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>. By this concentration on the idea the<span class='page-number' id='s-540' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.540]</span> mind enters from the idea into its reality, into which it sinks silent, absorbed, unified. This is the traditional method. There are, however, others which are equally of a Rajayogic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, since they use the mental and psychical being as key. Some of them are directed rather to the quiescence of the mind than to its immediate absorption, as the discipline by which the mind is simply watched and allowed to exhaust its habit of vagrant thought in a purposeless running from which it feels all sanction, purpose and interest withdrawn, and that, more strenuous and rapidly effective, by which all outward-going thought is excluded and the mind forced to sink into itself where in its absolute quietude it can only reflect the pure Being or pass away into its superconscient existence. The method differs, the object and the result are the same.\n\nHere, it might be supposed, the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and aim of Rajayoga must end. For its action is the stilling of the waves of consciousness, its manifold activities, *cittavṛtti*, first, through a habitual replacing of the turbid rajasic activities by the quiet and luminous sattwic, then, by the stilling of all activities; and its object is to enter into silent communion of soul and unity with the Divine. As a matter of fact we find that the system of Rajayoga includes other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>,—such as the practice and use of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>occult powers</span>,—some of which seem to be unconnected with and even inconsistent with its main purpose. These powers or siddhis are indeed frequently condemned as dangers and distractions which draw away the Yogin from his sole legitimate aim of divine union. On the way, therefore, it would naturally seem as if they ought to be avoided; and once the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> is reached, it would seem that they are then frivolous and superfluous. But Rajayoga is a psychic science and it includes the attainment of all the higher states of consciousness and their powers by which the mental being rises towards the superconscient as well as its ultimate and supreme possibility of union with the Highest. Moreover, the Yogin, while in the body, is not always mentally inactive and sunk in Samadhi, and an account of the powers and states which are possible to him on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>higher planes</span> of his being is necessary to the completeness of the science.<span class='page-number' id='s-541' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.541]</span>\n\nThese powers and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> belong, first, to the vital and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mental planes</span> above this physical in which we live, and are natural to the soul in the subtle body; as the dependence on the physical body decreases, these abnormal activities become possible and even manifest themselves without being sought for. They can be acquired and fixed by processes which the science gives, and their use then becomes subject to the will; or they can be allowed to develop of themselves and used only when they come, or when the Divine within moves us to use them; or else, even though thus naturally developing and acting, they may be rejected in a single-minded <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> to the one supreme goal of the Yoga. Secondly, there are fuller, greater powers belonging to the supramental planes which are the very powers of the Divine in his spiritual and supramentally ideative being. These cannot be acquired at all securely or integrally by personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, but can only come from above, or else can become natural to the man if and when he ascends <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> mind and lives in the spiritual being, power, consciousness and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideation</span>. They then become, not abnormal and laboriously acquired siddhis, but simply the very nature and method of his action, if he still continues to be active in the world-existence.\n\nOn the whole, for an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integral Yoga</span> the special methods of Rajayoga and Hathayoga may be useful at times in certain stages of the progress, but are not indispensable. It is true that their principal aims must be included in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>integrality</span> of the Yoga; but they can be brought about by other means. For the methods of the integral Yoga must be mainly spiritual, and dependence on physical methods or fixed psychic or psycho-physical processes on a large scale would be the substitution of a lower for a higher action. We shall have occasion to touch upon this question later when we come to the final principle of synthesis in method to which our examination of the different Yogas is intended to lead.<span class='page-number' id='s-542' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.542]</span>","url":"/cwsa/23/rajayoga","volt":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"23","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"The Synthesis of Yoga - I","u":"/cwsa/23"},{"t":"Book I"},{"t":"The Yoga of Integral Knowledge"}],"prvt":"Hathayoga","prvu":"/cwsa/23/hathayoga","items":[]}]
