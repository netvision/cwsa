We have also come to the conclusion that the disturbances in Mymensingh create no new problem but rather compel us to face as urgencies certain primary necessities we have too much neglected,â€”the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of no longer relying blindly on the purely hypnotic and illusory protection of the Pax Britannica which may at any moment fail us or be suspended; the necessity of an universal training in the practice of self-defence and a better organisation for mutual assistance; the necessity of recognising and practically grappling with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> difficulty. But neither of these occurrences has really made impossible, or even altered the conditions of, our programme of defensive resistance.\n\nThe third fresh departure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> is the Risley Circular. This circular is only a more comprehensive and carefully studied edition of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carlyle</span> Circular. It brings therefore no unfamiliar element into the problem; but there is this very important difference, that while the Carlyle Circular was a local experiment hastily adopted to meet an urgent difficulty and dropped as soon as it was found difficult to work, the Risley Circular is a deliberate policy adopted by the Supreme Government, with full <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the circumstances and of its possible effects, in the hope of striking at the very root of the Swadeshi <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. Everyone will remember the convulsion created by the Carlyle Circular. Its natural effect would have been to bring about an universal students' strike, and for a<span class='page-number' id='s-453' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.453]</span> few days it seemed as if such a strike would actually take place. Unfortunately the movement immediately affected certain vested interests and the representatives of those interests happened also to be the political leaders to whom the country and the students especially were accustomed to look for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. The leading spirits among the young men in Calcutta were still immature and wanting in grit and tenacity; the influence on their minds of their old leaders was very powerful; the new men were comparatively unknown and influenced the course of events rather by the concrete directness of their views, the ardour of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and the fiery <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of their speech and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> than by the weight of their personalities. The older leaders were, therefore, able by a strenuous and united <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of their authority to turn back the impetuous tide and dissipate the enormous motive-power which had been generated. They were too selfish to sacrifice their immediate interests, too blind and wanting in foresight to understand that the immediate loss and difficulty would be repaid tenfold by the inevitable effects of the movement. An universal educational strike at that moment, before the Government had become accustomed to the situation, would infallibly have unnerved the hand of power and brought about an almost immediate reconsideration of the Partition. Whatever the Government may say or do, it cannot afford to lose control of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> of the country; it cannot afford to hand over this immense mass of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span>, the India of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, into the hands of the political leaders without the subtle control and check which membership of a Government University exercises, without the opportunity of unstringing the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and soul which the present system of education provides. The Government must keep its hold on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of the young or lose India. The magnitude of their blunder was dimly perceived afterwards by some of the leaders and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> or two admitted it in private. We only recall that disastrous episode in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to lay stress on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that if again repeated the blunder will be worse than a blunder, it will be an offence against our posterity and a betrayal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>'s future.\n\nWhat is the position now? The Risley Circular is a desperate<span class='page-number' id='s-454' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.454]</span> attempt of the bureaucracy not only to recover and confirm its hold on the student population and through them on the future, but to make that hold far more stringent, rigid, ineffugable than it ever was in the past. They do not care very much if certain academical ideas of liberalism or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationalism</span> are imparted to the young by their teachers, but they desire to stop the active habit of patriotism in the young; for they know well that a mere intellectual habit untranslated into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> is of no value in after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japanese</span> when they teach Bushido to their boys do not rest content with lectures or a moral catechism; they make them practise Bushido and govern every thought and action of their life by the Bushido ideal. This is the only way of inculcating a quality into a nation, by instilling it practically into the minds of its youth at school and College until it becomes an ingrained, inherent, inherited national quality. This is what we have to do with the modern ideal of patriotism in India. We have to fill the minds of our boys from childhood with the idea of the country, and present them with that idea at every turn and make their whole young life a lesson in the practice of the virtues which afterwards go to make the patriot and the citizen. If we do not attempt this, we may as well give up our desire to create an Indian nation altogether; for without such a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> nationalism, patriotism, regeneration are mere words and ideas which can never become a part of the very soul of the nation and never therefore a great realised fact. Mere academical teaching of patriotism is of no avail. The professor may lecture every day on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Garibaldi</span> and Washington and the student may write themes about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> without bringing us any nearer to our supreme need,â€”the entry of the habit of patriotism into our very bone and blood. The Roman Satirist tells us that in the worst times of imperial despotism in Rome the favourite theme of teachers and boys in the schools was liberty and tyrannicide;â€”but neither liberty nor tyrannicide was practised by the boys when they became men; rather they grew up into submissive slaves of the single world-despot. It is for this reason that the men of the new party have welcomed the active <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> of our students with political meetings,<span class='page-number' id='s-455' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.455]</span> with the propagation and actual practice of Swadeshi, with the volunteer movement in its various <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>,â€”not, as has been malevolently suggested, out of a turbulent desire to make use of unripe young minds to create anarchy and disorder, but because they see in this political activity in the young the promise of a new generation of Indians who will take patriotism earnestly as a thing to live and die for, not as the pastime of leisure hours. Nobody who believes that such patriotism is the first need of this country can consistently oppose the participation of students in politics. When Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> is a thing realised and the present unnatural conditions have been remedied, then indeed this active participation may be brought under restriction and regulation; for then the inherited habit of patriotism, the atmosphere of a free country and the practice and teaching of the Bushido virtues within the limits of home and school life will be sufficient. But before then to submit to restrictions is to commit national suicide.\n\nIf our educated men do not understand thisâ€”as, indeed, with our want of direct political experience it is difficult for them to understand it,â€”our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> rulers at least have grasped the situation. Study their circular and you will see what it means. School students are not even to attend political meetings nor school teachers to teach them patriotism. Why? Because at that age the mind is soft and impressionable and what is seen and heard, sinks deep and tends to crystallise not merely into fixed ideas, but into *character*. A teacher may by his personal influence and teachings so surround the minds of his students with the idea of the country, of work for the country, of living and dying for the country, that this will become the dominant idea of their minds and, if associated with any kind of patriotic discipline or teaching in action, the dominant note in their character. The attendance of schoolboys as volunteers at political meetings, their work in the reception and service of men honoured by the country for patriotic service, their active participation in semi-political, semi-religious *utsavas* are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> part of such a patriotic discipline. It is this against which the efforts of the bureaucracy are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> directed, by the Risley Circular, by the prohibition of<span class='page-number' id='s-456' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.456]</span> the Shivaji *utsava* outside the Deccan, by the attack on our *melas* and other public occasions where such training is possible. For the same reason the *active* participation of College students in political meetings is forbidden. At the age of College students ideas may be modified, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> may be powerfully influenced by what they hear and see, but character can only be influenced and modified by action. And it is of *character* in action that the bureaucracy is afraid, not so much of mere ideas, mere speeches, mere writings. Let the College students attend political meetings and *utsavas*â€”that by itself will not hurt the bureaucracy; but let them not organise or take part in them, for that means the character affected, the habit of political action formed, the first elementary beginnings of service to the country commenced. Picketing and active participation in Swadeshi work is of course still more objectionable from the bureaucratic standpoint. For the same reason, again, College professors are forbidden to influence their students or lead them to political meetings: for that brings in the powerful impetus of leading and example and threatens the bureaucracy with the beginnings of organisation.\n\nThe Risley Circular, with its sanctimonious professions of anxiety for the best interests of students and guardians, is in reality a powerful attack on the growing spirit of Nationalism at its most vital point. As such we must understand it and as such resist it.<span class='page-number' id='s-457' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.457]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-true-meaning-of-the-risley-circular","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Cool Courage and Not Blood-and-Thunder Speeches","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/cool-courage-and-not-blood-and-thunder-speeches","dt":"1907-05-28","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["cool-courage-and-not-blood-and-thunder-speeches"],"t":"Cool Courage and Not Blood-and-Thunder Speeches","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"It seems that our Local Columns Editor yesterday, seeing the name of Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal at the head of the report of the Shaktipuja meeting in Sobhabazar, thought it unnecessary to examine the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> closely.

That a prominent leader of the Congress party should show such an unseasonable partiality for the Anglo-Indian Press whose recent campaign of misrepresentation and vituperation has been unpardonable in the eyes of every self-respecting Indian, is surprising at the first glance.

The utilisation by the bureaucracy of Nawab Salimullah and by Nawab Salimullah of hooligans to harass and, if possible, break the Boycott is nothing new, but the extent to which this sinister opposition has been carried and the wide space of country over which it has been attempted, is a new phenomenon. But there is one measure of the Government which is in itself a new phenomenon and seriously affects, if it does not entirely alter the whole situation. This is the Coercion Ordinance directed against public meetings. It would not be true to say that the ordinance was absolutely unforeseen.<span class='page-number' id='s-461' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.461]</span> We at least had always held it extremely probable if not quite certain, that this and even more violent and crushing methods of coercion would eventually be adopted by the bureaucracy in its struggle for self-preservation. But we did not anticipate so rapid a development of coercive measures, or that they would reach their height, as they threaten to do under a professedly Radical and democratic Government. Not that we ever believed there was any essential difference between Liberals and Conservatives with regard to India, but there was a difference in their professions and we imagined that what the Conservatives would do immediately and without compunction, the Liberals would also do, but with hesitation and some show of reluctance. There has, however, been no slightest sign of reluctance.

Nevertheless, though not expected so soon, the Coercion Ordinance was not a contingency which had altogether been left out of view.\n\nWhat then is the new condition which it creates? One of immense importance. Up till now our whole programme with unimportant exceptions has fallen well within the law. We have worked against bureaucratic government, we have not worked against the law nor exceeded its restrictions in any of our methods. So careful have we been in this respect that the bureaucracy have been at a loss where to get a hold on the Swadeshi movement without losing their prestige and reputation, and in the end they have been obliged to throw their reputation overboard and allow the agents of their ally, the Nawab of Dacca, to create disorder so as to prepare the way for proclaiming the Swadeshi areas. This desire to keep within the law was not, as some of our disappointed adversaries suggested, born of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> or unwillingness to bear sacrifices for the countryâ€”for even without breaking the law <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> Swadeshi workers had to go to jail or undergo police and Gurkha violence, but part of a well-reasoned policy. To be able to keep within the law gives an immense advantage to a young movement opposed by a strong<span class='page-number' id='s-462' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.462]</span> adversary in possession of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> of legal repression and oppression; for it allows it to grow into adult strength before <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> the enemy a sufficient grasp to strangle it while it is yet immature. Moreover, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> which can show a respect for law even in the first throes of a revolution, has a better <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of enjoying a stable and successful government of its own when its chance comes. Nevertheless legality can never be the first consideration in a struggle of the kind we have entered upon, and if new laws are passed which offend against political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ethics</span>, which make our service and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to our country impossible and to obey which would therefore be an unpatriotic act, they cannot possibly command <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span>. Still more is this the case when the measure in question is not a law, but an executive ukase which may yet be prevented from passing into law. This can best be done by a widespread and quiet but determined passive resistance which will make the ukase inoperative without a resort to measures of the most extreme and shameless Russianism. We have not concealed our opinion that this is the course the country ought to adopt in the present juncture, if for no other reason, then because it is our duty as men, as citizens, as patriots.\n\nWe recognise, however, that much is yet to be said on the opposite side. The strongest argument against the course we have suggested, is that the bureaucracy evidently desire an immediate struggle. The course of events at Barisal, the recent outrageous insult to a prominent Swadeshi worker and the insolent harassment of the townspeople by the local officials and their underlings, are extremely significant. The attempt to provoke a struggle between the Hindus and Mahomedans culminating in the singular affair of the Barisal night panic which still calls for explanation, has been a failure. It seems that the police are now attempting to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> on some demonstration which will give them an excuse for turning Barisal into a second Rawalpindi. The unprovoked blow given by a Gurkha to Srijut Satis Chandra <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chatterji</span> was obviously a prearranged affair, leaving the victim the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> between swallowing the insult and an act of retaliation which might have led to an *Ã©meute*.<span class='page-number' id='s-463' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.463]</span> We think that Srijut Satis Chandra on the whole did well to subordinate his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of his country, but the odds were the other way, and the police must have known it. That in case of resistance even of the most passive kind, the police or military would not \"hesitate to shoot\", is extremely probable from the action of the Punjab authorities and the known <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the local officials in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. Would it then be wise for us, it is argued, to expose ourselves passively to the arrest and deportation of our leaders, the dragooning of our towns and villages, the utmost outrages on men and women and all the violent ills of despotic repression, without any certain gain to the country to set in the opposite balance? The question really turns on the precise strength of the movement at its present stage of growth. If it is already strong enough to bear extreme Russian repression without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> unnerved and demoralised, the course we have suggested is the best, because it is the boldest. If not, it would be sounder policy perhaps to leave the bureaucracy to its Pyrrhic victory for a while and immediately turn all our energies to giving the movement the necessary strength,â€”in other words, the necessary organisation of men, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> and means which it needs in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to cope with the bureaucracy on equal terms.

The least that India now demands is the admission of the people of the country to the management of its own affairs. But it is at once surprising and gratifying to find that the organ of Palace Chambers has at last realised the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a complete and revolutionary change in the whole system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>.

This is the main reason, even apart from their insufficiency, that any mere administrative reforms are looked upon with suspicion by the Nationalist party. The great and permanent improvement India demands is an entire change of the principles of government in India, and a small and temporary improvement in details, leaving the principles untouched, would not be \"on the line and in the direction\" of the great improvement called for; it would be its worst enemy.

Excluding this class of Indians, the more thoughtful, sober-minded and responsible section of congressmen who form the majority, will be in favour of the idea, provided financial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> could be overcome and the most representative congressmen induced to visit <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>.\"\n\nAnd it asserts that \"a successful Congress session in London would be more fruitful especially at a juncture like the present than five sessions held in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>\". Fruitful in what respect? If our contemporary means fruitful in expenditure, humiliation and loss of self-respect, then we must agree with him.

The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> does not live in London and the root idea of a *national* <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is opposed to this continual theatrical supplication to the very people who are interested in preventing us from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> a nation. While our contemporary confidently asserts that a successful session in London would be more \"fruitful\" than five sessions held in India, we, belonging as we do to that section which Mr. Romesh <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> during his two hours' presidentship of the Congress saw routed by the Moderates, may be permitted to suggest that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> such session will do more injury to the country and the cause than five years without a session of the Congress. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of British statesmen, moreover, is not encouraging even to the Moderates who still think of getting rights marked \"Made in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Great Britain</span>\" in the same consignment with Liverpool salt or Manchester piece-goods. The hand on the dial will be put back if we leave the nation and check the growing spirit of self-help and self-exertion to go and beg for \"rights\" in England and spend on this fruitless act sums which we badly require for the long-neglected task of national organisation. \"The time,\" says our contemporary, \"has come when Congressmen in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> should face the British public.\" Possibly; but not to \"plead the<span class='page-number' id='s-467' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.467]</span> cause of India and her inhabitants in the very metropolis of the Empire\".

The real point at issue now is whether it will or will not be wise to make a frontal in preference to a flank attack on the coercion ukase.

The present ukase is the deliberate act of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> and the Secretary of State, and its legality is as undoubted as its political immorality. The question therefore is whether we shall persist in carrying on our movement rigidly within the pale of the law, however oppressive the law may be, or follow the example of the Irish and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> Nonconformists by passive resistance to the law itself with a view to bringing about its repeal. The answer really hangs upon the possible next move of the bureaucracy and our preparedness to meet it. If the bureaucrats try to break our resistance as at Rawalpindi by wholesale arrest, deportation and police and military violence, as well as the still more questionable methods we have seen in operation in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal, shall we still be able to persist, and, if not, what will be our next course? This is the question which has given pause for a moment to the active prosecution of the Nationalist campaign, since it involves a serious issue of policy which must be settled before concerted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> can take place. For if the ukase is to be passively resisted, the opposition must be offered in concert and ubiquitously. A sporadic resistance will be ineffectual and give the advantage to our adversaries.\n\nWe again repeat that in our opinion the boldest course is the best. If we thought, as the Anglo-Indian papers affect to think, that the movement was the result of our own efforts, a mere<span class='page-number' id='s-470' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.470]</span> human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, we might be of a different opinion. But throughout we have been conscious that our own efforts and the impulse given or the work done by leading men, whether Moderates or Extremists, have been so small, petty and inefficient that they are absolutely insufficient to explain the extraordinary results. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> has been absurdly inadequate, the organisation nil, the means at our disposal pitiably small, the real workers few and mostly obscure, and yet the Indian world has stood amazed and the Anglo-Indian aghast at the vast and incommensurate results of an apparatus so inefficient. We believe, therefore, that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> Power is behind the movement, that the *Zeitgeist*, the Time-Spirit, is at work to bring about a mighty movement of which the world at the present juncture has need, that that movement is the resurgence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span> and that the resurgence of India is not only a necessary part of the larger movement but its central need, that India is the keystone of the arch, the chief inheritress of the common Asiatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. The Mongolian world, preserving the old strong and reposeful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> of early Asia, flanks her on the right and has already arisen. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> world, preserving the aggressive and militant civilisation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span>, flanks her on the left and in Egypt, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arabia</span>, in Persia, is struggling to arise. In India the two civilisations meet, she is the link between them and must find the note of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> which will reconcile them and recreate a common Asiatic civilisation. Viewing the movement in this larger light we believe that as its progress and development has been in the past, so it will be in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> above ordinary human calculations, with only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> thing certain about it, that no external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> can frustrate it and no internal intrigue divert. Neither John <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span> nor Denzil Ibbetson nor Nawab Salimullah, neither false friend nor open enemy, nor even our own mistakes and weakness can come in its way, but rather they are unconsciously helping it on and working for it. In this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> we are willing to take any risk and meet any expense of our blood and our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for the great end. To husband our men or our resources and try to buy liberty in the cheapest market, would be a false and foolish economy. Lajpat Rai has been swallowed up in the maelstrom and hundreds more<span class='page-number' id='s-471' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.471]</span> will follow him, but their disappearance will make no difference either to the strength of the movement or its velocity. Still it will move.\n\nBut, subject to this confidence and readiness to throw our all into the gulf, we recognise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of relying on our human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> us in perplexity, leaving it to the Power behind to make our mistakes as useful, perhaps more useful to the final success than our wiser judgments. On one thing only we must lay fast hold, on the triple unity of Swadeshi, Boycott and Swaraj.

Writes the *Daily News*:â€”\"It is gratifying to learn that some of the Native States are following in the wake of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> of India for the suppression of sedition, if not political agitation altogether. News comes from Srinagar that His Highness the Maharaja of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kashmir</span> is about to issue a proclamation warning his subjects against the pitfalls of the so-called nationalist agitation. We do not doubt that his brother rulers in the Punjab will emulate so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> an example.\" Some of us were at a loss to understand the cause of the *Daily News*'s jubilation. Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code runs as follows:â€”\"Whoever by words either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise brings or attempts to bring into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span> or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the Government established by law in British India, shall be punished with transportation for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>.\" So sedition in Kashmir is not sedition in British India; and by the attempts of the Kashmir durbar to suppress sedition <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> naturally understood attempts to suppress the endeavours of Kashmir subjects to bring into hatred and contempt or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the Kashmir durbar. But the Proclamation removed our doubt. We are asked to believe that the Maharaja of Kashmir, with a wonderful tact for self-effacement, was anxious only to protect the Government established by law in British India. The Maharaja's tender solicitude for the safety of the Power which<span class='page-number' id='s-473' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.473]</span> had sold Kashmir to his ancestor and had, only the other day, condemned him unheard, was amazing indeed. But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> did not end here. Following close upon the issuing of the Proclamation a durbar was held in Kashmir. Sir Francis Younghusband made a speech and the thanks of the British Government were conveyed to the Maharaja. The Maharaja, we are told, was so greatly affected that he could hardly find words to express his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, which is hardly wonderful considering the circumstances. He was able only to say that the tradition of his house was one of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> to the British Government. \"This,\" says the *Hindu Patriot*, \"is as it should be.\"\n\nWe cannot understand the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> of the \"oldest native paper in India\". Why should it be so? Did not the founder of the Kashmir house pay a very heavy price for Kashmir! True to a disgraceful understanding with the British Government, of which both parties ought to have been ashamed, Golab Singhâ€”to quote Sir Thomas Holdich,â€”\"deserted his Sikh masters and paid for Kashmir with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> looted from the Lahore treasury\". So it was only \"give and take\".\n\nBut these pathetic and miraculous happenings appear more intelligibleâ€”and less patheticâ€”when we realise that though the voice is the voice of Jacob, the hands are the hands of Esau. And this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> becomes patent when we find that Kashmir does not present an isolated instance of such zeal on the part of Native Chiefs to safeguard the interests of the bureaucracy. If Kashmir can be made useful to suppress sedition, the Maharaja of Coochbehar can at least <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> in putting down the boycott. On the occasion of the distribution of prizes to the students of the Jenkins School the Maharaja of Coochbehar said that \"schoolboys were ciphers in politics\", and warned them against the danger of rushing into the whirlpool of politics, or joining in any political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. Boys must read and play and ought never to concern themselves with matters <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> their grasp, and about which, on account of their age and inexperience, they have not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to form sound, mature and correct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>. With Swadeshism His Highness declared his full sympathy but he \"was totally, entirely and absolutely against boycott\".<span class='page-number' id='s-474' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.474]</span> If anything approaching the boycott movement was seen in his territory His Highness gave in clear, emphatic and unequivocal language to understand that he would adopt very stringent measures to put it down. It is a pity that it should have been made necessary for the Maharaja to be so clear, emphatic and unequivocal and we can only extend to him our heart-felt sympathy.\n\nBut we cannot hold these Indian princes responsible for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> they do or say. Their so-called independence is nothing more than a mere name. Though <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> called them his \"colleagues and partners in the task of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>\" the truth was better expressed by Lord Dufferin who characterised the independence enjoyed by them as a \"regulated independence\", regulated by whom and to what extent it is superfluous to say. The incubus of the British Resident is always there. And the results of his interventionâ€”often disastrous to the Chiefsâ€”were thus summed up by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gaekwar</span> of Baroda in the *Nineteenth Century* in 1901â€”\"Uncertainty and want of confidence in the indigenous Government is promoted. The influence of the Raja, which is indispensable for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> of the States, is thereby impaired. The ruler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> discouraged slackens his interest in the continuity of his own policy.\" Then, of course, there are the annual visitations to relieve the States of their superfluous wealth and prove to the people that their Chief is no better than a pigmy before the vicegerent of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> now taken by these Chiefs towards the spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> that is re-creating India, shows merely the degree to which the bureaucracy is determined directly and indirectly to stamp out the spirit. They have greater advantages in the States than in their own territory, for they can make the measures more thoroughgoing and rigorous than in British India and they can at the same time, through the Anglo-Indian Press, point to this rigour as a proof of the superior liberalism of British bureaucracy as compared with a native rule. This is indeed killing two birds with one stone.<span class='page-number' id='s-475' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.475]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/regulated-independence","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"A Consistent Patriot","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-consistent-patriot","prvt":"The Question of the Hour","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-question-of-the-hour","dt":"1907-06-04","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-consistent-patriot"],"t":"A Consistent Patriot","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Even <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Homer</span> nods, and even the *Hindu Patriot* makes slips at times.

But his brother chiefs do not seem ready to follow his noble example, and excepting the 'enlightened' Maharaja of Mysore, they may not care to do so. The Maharaja of Kashmir however is in right earnest. He has prohibited public and even private meetings of a revolutionary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, and is the pet of the bureaucracy for playing this sort of masterly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>.\"\n\nBut this attempt to imbibe the spirit of the age, perhaps, got a rude shaking from some quarter and the *Patriot* seized the first opportunity to rectify its \"mistake\". On the 30th it again referred to the subject and remarked:â€”\n\n\"The Maharaja of Kashmir's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> and anti-sedition measures have elicited from the Viceroy a tribute of warm appreciation. A grand durbar was held at Srinagar to proclaim the Viceroy's message of thanks. Sir Francis Younghusband, late of the Tibet Mission, delivered a sombre sermon bristling with references to the efforts of the Maharaja to keep down sedition, and overflowing with advice and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> words which no doubt went straight and deep into His Highness' <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and found a comfortable lodgement there.

This peculiarity is shared by its pets and proteges. Sometime ago a vernacular paper in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span> published an alleged interview with Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> in which that carefully moderate politician was actually represented as using expressions which might be taken for an incitement to rebellion.

A similar spirit is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> shown with regard to Srijut Bipin Pal's repudiation of the Shaktipuja report. The *Englishman*, flattered probably by being preferred to the *Daily News*, was gracious enough, in a paragraph full of the most outrageous and insufferable impertinence, to acknowledge that Bipin Babu should not be held responsible for the \"sins of the *Bande Mataram*\". Yesterday, however, it published lengthy letters in which its correspondents still insisted on this vicarious punishment. The *Daily News* also seems to have been piqued by not being noticed and tries to belittle the effect of Bipin Babu's disclaimer. It even proposes to extend the principle of vicarious punishment much farther and make Bipin Babu responsible for the alleged utterances of a Madrasi speaker whom it gratuitously assumes to be his \"associate\". We presume the Anglo-Indian journals consider themselves superior to the ordinary etiquette in such matters as observed in other countries; otherwise we should have imagined that a disclaimer by a public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> of unauthorized reports of his utterances ought to be regarded as final.

It is natural that our adversaries should exult over this silence and point to it as an evidence of complete demoralisation, and it is natural that those of us who are not in constant touch with the mofussil should also feel the silence burdensome and talk of demoralisation. We do not believe that the country is demoralised. On the contrary we believe that circumstances have taken an extremely favourable turn. There is, to begin with, an immense revolution of opinion <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> which has brought all but the inveterate loyalists to understand the situation and face realities. Secondly if our information from the mofussil is correct, the people, the rank and file, are by no means cowed down, but rather from every part we hear news of men girding themselves for real work, now that the outer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> is hampered and our hopes and aspirations driven in upon themselves.

Nevertheless, in a certain small section there is undoubtedly bewilderment, hesitation and something like panic and we would be glad to believe that these feelings<span class='page-number' id='s-478' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.478]</span> are not shared by any of our leaders or at least by those who have hitherto arrogated to themselves leadership and the credit for all the work that has been done.

On the other hand, if they are demoralised, if they are suffering from sinkings and searchings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, they ought to take some trouble to hide it.

The bureaucracy has altered its front and changed its plan of campaign. Will it be enough to modify our old policy to meet a new but surely not unexpected situation or will it be necessary for us also to change our plan of campaign? One thing at least is certain, we in Bengal have no intention of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> up Swaraj, no intention of giving up Swadeshi, no intention of giving up Boycott; to this the Bhupendranaths and the others must make up their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>. If any leader tries to lower this triple banner of the cause, he forfeits his reputation and his position from that date. The country has no intention of withdrawing from a single essential position that has once been occupied.<span class='page-number' id='s-479' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.479]</span>\n\nAlthough we can make no claims to leadership, we have, as a responsible organ of public opinion, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of laying our views before the people and we have not failed to do so to the best of our ability. The policy we advocate now is the policy we have always advocated, the policy of the organisation of Swaraj and passive resistance. To push forward Swadeshi, to push forward National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>, to take up Arbitration in earnest and for the effective working of this positive side to create what we have not up till now created except in certain districts,â€”a compact, well-managed, earnest organisation; on the other hand, to follow a rational, effective and steady system of Boycott, and passively to oppose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> repression at every turn, to disregard the Risley Circular, to disregard the bureaucratic intimidation of the Press, to disregard or circumvent if we cannot disregard the Coercion Ordinance, to meet with silent contempt the danger of deportation and the threat of imprisonment; this is the policy we would favour if there are men in Bengal bold enough and steadfast enough to carry it out. Doubtless there are other dangers more serious than any that have yet threatened us, but if we lower the tone of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> on account of anticipated calamities which may never happen, we may stand charged before posterity with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> of sacrificing the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> to vain and timid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span>. Here again the wisdom of Vidula has a word in season for us; \"Make not great thy foeman by thy terrors, panic eyes behind.\" The bureaucracy will use every method to kill the movement, guile as well as terrorism; they will try to bribe us with remedial measures as well as to bludgeon us with ordinances; they will wave the sword at us whenever we make the slightest movement and use it on occasion. Our future depends on our surmounting both inducement and intimidation. Let us take possible dangers into consideration, by all means, and provide against them, never run our heads against them wantonly and without occasion; but to be turned from our path by possible dangers is neither true manhood nor true prudence. The path to Swaraj can never be safe.

This time, as we had expected, it is aimed at the Press. The Resolution is full of sound and fury signifying little.

Everyone knows that the statement is untrue. The boycott was no doubt the final cause of the hooliganism in the East just as the Russian revolutionary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was the final cause of the excesses of the Black Hundred, but it was in no way the immediate and efficient cause. It was the final cause in this sense that its first success compelled Sir Bampfylde Fuller to look about for a counteracting influence and he found it in the Nawab of Dacca and the use that could be made of the Nawab's position to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> on a breach between the Mahomedans and Hindus. That is the whole and sole connection of boycott with the Mymensingh disturbances. The rest followed by a natural course of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>. Sir Bampfylde favoured the Mahomedans and depressed the Hindus, the Nawab excited his co-religionists against their fellow-countrymen. There was no concealment about this policy, no pretences. Sir Bampfylde Fuller openly declared that of his two wives the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> was his favourite and his favouritism was gross, open, palpable. He flourished it in the face of the public instead of concealing it. The Nawab of Dacca has also openly preached to his co-religionists about the wrongs they have suffered at the hands of the Hindus and called upon them<span class='page-number' id='s-483' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.483]</span> to separate themselves from that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> and injurious connexion. There has been no concealment whatever about his anti-Hindu campaign. After the disappearance of Sir Bampfylde from the scene of his exploits, the philo-Mahomedanism of the Shillong <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> was no longer openly flourished in the face of the public but it was steadily continued in practice. The alliance of Anglo-India with the Nawab was from the beginning made the most of by the *Englishman* which for some time carried on a very active philo-Mahomedan and anti-Hindu crusade in its columns and did its best to stir up enmity between the two communities. So there came the first Mymensingh disturbances, the Comilla riots and finally the supreme <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conflagration</span> that started from Jamalpur. That conflagration was brought about by Maulavis preaching outrage and plunder in the name of the Nawab of Dacca and the Government, an imputation which the Nawab of Dacca has made no attempt to repudiate, though, it is said, he has been challenged to do so in answer to his hollow professions of a desire to bring about amity between the two communities, while the Shillong Government has repudiated it only tardily and indirectly if at all, and only after the full mischief had been done. In all the incitements urged by the Maulavis and by the authors of the notorious Red Pamphlet, there has been no mention of a violent enforcement of the boycott on the Mahomedans, neither has any such connexion been established by any of the judicial proceedings which have hitherto been concluded. The theory of Mr. John Morley is therefore a dead thing and of no farther interest to any human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>.\n\nOf course the bureaucracy will go on playing with the bones of this dead scarecrow; it will wage war on Swadeshism on the plea that it leads to disorder; but that is only because, like all bureaucracies, it is sublimely indifferent to reason and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> and public opinion. It has served its turn by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> which it foisted through the mouth of Honest John on a loudly applauding though somewhat befogged House of Commons and it does not care even if the fiction is disproved a thousand times over. It will go on acting as if the fiction were a fact.

For our own part, we have expressed ourselves in favour of an educational strike, because that is the most straightforward, the most masculine and the most aggressive form of passive resistance of which the occasion allows. We hold that in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to rise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> must get into the habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> challenges rather than receiving them and when it is behind, it must take the swiftest and most direct form of demonstration open to it. Passive resistance can be carried on in an inert and passive spirit of mechanical reaction against pressure from above, or it may be carried on in an active and creative spirit, it may take the initiative instead of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> driven; it may assail the citadels of the enemy instead of merely defending its own. What <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> needs especially at this moment is the aggressive virtues, the spirit of soaring idealism, bold <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>, fearless resistance, courageous attack; of the passive tamasic spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> we have already too much. We need to cultivate another training and temperament, another habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>. We would apply to the present situation the vigorous motto of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Danton</span>, that what we need, what we should learn above all things is to dare and<span class='page-number' id='s-487' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.487]</span> again to dare and still to dare.\n\nNevertheless we recognise that to leap at once from an overpoweringly tamasic condition of mind into the rajasic, the active, restless, bold and creative, is not easy for a nation and if we cannot have the best method, we will accept the second best, so long as the principle of resistance is maintained. A general defiance of the Circular will obviously make it unworkable, unless the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> is prepared to disaffiliate schools and Colleges freely and give up its control of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. It is possible, of course, that they may do so in the hope of bringing the country to its knees by drawing home the conviction that it cannot take in hand its own education. But this will be a dangerous game to play; for the only thing that is needed to make the institution of a widespread and comprehensive system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span> possible and indeed eminently practicable, is the generation of an enthusiasm such as was beginning to gather <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Carlyle</span> Circular. A stern and bitter struggle between the people and the bureaucracy is the one thing that is likely to generate such an enthusiasm. National education is by no means impracticable or even difficult, it needs nothing but a resolute enthusiasm in the country and the courage to take a leap into the unknown. This courage is common in individuals but not in nations, least of all in subject nations; and yet when the fire is lit, it is perhaps subject nations more than any other which are found ready to take the leap.\n\nWe do not believe the bureaucracy will be willing to drive matters to such a crisis. It is more likely that they will use the Circular to harass the opposition and overcome our resistance by instituting measures of petty persecution wherever they can do it without upheaving the whole foundation of the educational system in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. All that is demanded from us is therefore a persistent resolution to make the Circular unworkable regardless of loss and sacrifice. We must take every opportunity of challenging the Circular and testing the resolution of the bureaucracy and the campaign must be carried on simultaneously all over Bengal, if not in other parts of India as well. But it is Calcutta which must give the signal. Indeed, Calcutta has already given the signal. Meetings have been held in which teachers and students have<span class='page-number' id='s-488' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.488]</span> attended and taken an active part; more meetings of the kind will be held and when the Colleges reopen, there must be a general defiance of the ukase. Once Calcutta leads the way, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal will respond and West Bengal follow the general example.

This pleasant news opens the way to a most interesting line of speculation and we would suggest that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of our contemporaries, say, the *Sandhya*, might start a plebiscite or a prize-competition for the correct list of the fortunate victims.

If we ourselves are to be one of the recipients of this Government distinction, we must petition the authorities beforehandâ€”even at the sacrifice of our principlesâ€”that the three editors may be allowed to share the same cell and assist each other at the same oakum picking or other exhilarating occupation in store for us, so that we may support each other \"under the burden of an honour into which we were not born\". Always provided that the editor of the *Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nation</span>* is not one of the three.\n\n---\n\nThe *Empire* is very much hurt that the Indian papers have not taken any notice of the Viceroy's magnanimous though somewhat belated refusal to sanction the Punjab Colonisation Bill.<span class='page-number' id='s-489' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.489]</span> Our contemporary thinks that we kept silent out of pure cussedness. This is unkind. Could not our dear white brotherâ€”or our dear green brother, we should sayâ€”realise that there were other reasons, honourable or natural, for this unanimous hush. It might have been out of sheer awe, it might have been out of a choked emotion. Some scruples of delicacy, some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of the \"sorrow rather than <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span>\" sort, perhaps even excessive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> may have stopped the flow of utterance. For instance, supposing in the rush of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gratitude</span> one were to let slip unpleasant hints about the relation between the Rawalpindi row and the Viceroy's sudden and stupendous magnanimity! Who would like to hurt our sympathetic Viceroy's feelings by such ungracious truths! Or again supposing the Bengal papers were contrasting silently events in the Punjab and Bengal? They do present a remarkable contrast. In Bengal we have agitated for two yearsâ€”first with repeated petitions, with countless protest meetings, with innumerable wails and entreaties from press and platform; but that could not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> us, insult and ridicule were our only gain. Then we tried every lawful means of concrete protest, every kind of passive resistance within the law to show that we were in earnest. Result,â€”nil. But in Punjab they petitioned and protested only for a few weeks and thenâ€”went for Europeans, their persons, their property and everything connected with them. Resultâ€”the water tax postponed, the Colonisation Bill cancelled. Of course, as loyal subjects such as the *Empire* wants us to be we must regard the contrast with sorrow rather than with anger. But if we were publicly to mention these matters, might not our feelings and even our motives be misunderstood? Might it not even happen that Police-Constable Andrew would run us in, under his new-old powers for sedition? And how could a loyal Press expose itself to such misunderstanding? The *Empire* will surely agree with us, on reflection, that silence was best.\n\n---\n\nIt is a new and gratifying feature of present-day politics to find the *Englishman* reporting Bengali meetings in the Calcutta squares with a full appreciation of their importance. The meeting<span class='page-number' id='s-490' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.490]</span> in College Square at which Srijut <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span> Kumar <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mitra</span> presided has been favoured as well as Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal's meeting at Beadon Square. As to the accuracy of the reports we have our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span>, for the Bengali gentleman who reports for our contemporary is afflicted with the idea that he is very humorous, and there is nothing so fatal to accuracy as a sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span>. We would not object to this amiable delusion, or the particular style of the reporter's wit, if it did not so persistently recall to us the imperial citizen of the British metropolis out on a spree who thinks it a huge joke to tickle his fellow citizens with a peacock's feather or to comment on their possession of hair or the origin of their headgear with other light and cutting sarcasms. However, we note with satisfaction that teachers and students attended the meeting, that a teacher presided, another spoke and a student seconded a resolution. We too await with interest the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the authorities in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>.\n\n---\n\nOur venerable friend the *Indian Mirror* has solemnly assured us that it should be understood that no Government, Conservative or Liberal, will countenance violent methods, such as the Extremists have hitherto employed. For this surprising information, drawn no doubt from occult sources, much thanks. But still we cannot help inquiring, who the devil ever asked them to? No one in his senses, or out of them, either, ever dreamed of calling upon any Englishman to support the Extremist policy. We note with interest that the *Mirror* considers Boycott, Passive Resistance, National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>, Arbitration and physical training to be \"violent\" methods. On the other hand we find Srijut Narendra Nath Sen's signature affixed to the recently issued statement in which the use of violent methods in Bengal is denied. Hail, holy light, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> reflective *Mirror*!\n\n---\n\nThe breathless speed with which the *Statesman* is legislating and administering the affairs of the nation, makes one's head whirl. One day the Simla Government, no doubt laying heads together<span class='page-number' id='s-491' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.491]</span> with Mr. John <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>, issues a notice handing the Press over to the tender mercies of the local administrations, but with a rider that this is in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of a warning to the Press to behave itself and the effect will be watched before action is taken. After watching the effect for the space of twenty-four hours the *Statesman* issues an order from Darjeeling to prosecute any three papers out of the long list of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> and vernacular publications in Bengal, the selection to be made on the principle of the loudest first. Before the Press has recovered from this shock, while everybody from the *Englishman* down to the *Mihir Sudhakar* is brooding over his past sins and preparing for the arrival of the police with handcuffs, while even the *Mirror* and the *Nation* are trying to banish uncomfortable memories of an indiscreet article or two on the Jamalpur outrages, lo and behold, the *Statesman* in its Viceregal Council at Simla is forging a new Act which shall provide for the gagging of the Press without the trouble of a prosecution.

A whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, a whole world catches the fire which burned in a few hearts; the soil which has drunk the blood of the martyr imbibes with it a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span> which it breathes into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of all its children, until there is but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> overmastering idea, one imperishable resolution in the minds of all beside which all other hopes and interests fade into insignificance and until it is fulfilled, there can be no peace or rest for the land or its rulers. It is at this moment that the idea begins to create its heroes and fighters, whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and courage defeat only multiplies and confirms until the idea militant has become the idea triumphant. Such is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the idea, so invariable in its broad lines that it is evidently the working of a natural law.\n\nBut the despot will not recognise this superiority, the teachings of history have no meaning for him. He is dazzled by the<span class='page-number' id='s-494' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.494]</span> pomp and splendour of his own power, infatuated with the sense of his own irresistible strength. Naturally, for the signs and proofs of his own power are visible, palpable, in his camps and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>armaments</span>, in the crores and millions which his tax-gatherers wring out of the helpless masses, in the tremendous array of cannon and implements of war which fill his numerous arsenals, in the compact and swiftly-working organisation of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>, in the prisons into which he hurls his opponents, in the fortresses and places of exile to which he can hurry the men of the idea. He is deceived also by the temporary triumph of his repressive measures. He strikes out with his mailed hand and surging multitudes are scattered like chaff with a single blow; he hurls his thunderbolts from the citadels of his strength and ease and the clamour of a continent sinks into a deathlike hush; or he swings the rebels by rows from his gibbets or mows them down by the hundred with his mitrailleuse and then stands alone erect amidst the ruin he has made and thinks, \"The trouble is over, there is nothing more to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>. My rule will endure for ever; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> will not remember what I have done or take account of the blood that I have spilled.\" And he does not know that the fiat has gone out against him, \"Thou fool! this night shall thy soul be required of thee.\" For to the Power that rules the world one day is the same as fifty years. The time lies in His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>, but now or afterwards the triumph of the idea is assured, for it is He who has sent it into men's minds that His purposes may be fulfilled.\n\nThe story is so old, so often repeated that it is a wonder the delusion should still persist and repeat itself. Each despotic rule after the other thinks, \"Oh, the circumstances in my case are quite different, I am a different thing from any yet recorded in history, stronger, more virtuous and moral, better organised. I am God's favourite and can never come to harm.\" And so the old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>drama</span> is staged again and acted till it reaches the old catastrophe. The historic madness has now overtaken the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British nation</span> in the height of its worldwide power and material greatness.

Yet only consider how many ideas are arising which find in British despotism their chief antagonist. The idea of a free and self-centred Ireland has been reborn and the souls of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fitzgerald</span> and Emmett are reincarnating. The idea of a free Egypt and the Pan-Islamic idea have joined hands in the land of the Pharaohs. The idea of a free and united India has been born and arrived at full stature in the land of the Rishis, and the spiritual force of a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> of which the world has need, is gathering at its back. Will England crush these ideas with ukases and coercion laws? Will she even kill them with maxims and siege-guns?

They are three in number, a trinity of marvels; an advisory Council of Notables, enlarged Legislative and Provincial Councils, admission of one or two Indians to the India Council.\n\nAn advisory Council of Notablesâ€”we can see it in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>'s eye. The Nawab of Dacca, the Maharaja of Darbhanga, the Maharajas of Coochbehar and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kashmir</span>, the Raja of Nabha, Sir Harnam Singh, a few other Rajas and Maharajas (*not* including the Maharaja of Baroda), Dr. Rash Behari <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span>, Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Justice</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mukherji</span>, a goodly number of non-official Europeans, the knight of the umbrella from Bombay, etc. etc. with Mr.<span class='page-number' id='s-496' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.496]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> bringing up the tail as the least dangerous of those whom Mr. Morley felt that he must reluctantly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> \"our enemies\". And what will the business of this illustrious assembly be? It will find out what the opinion of the country is (on which the members will be better authorities no doubt than a highly inconvenient Press) and inform the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>; they will also find out the meaning of the Government (if that be humanly possible) and inform the country. We suppose it would be seditious to laugh at a Secretary of State, for is he not part of the Government established by law? So we will merely say that the right place for this truly comic Council of Notables with its yet more comic functions is an opera by Gilbert and Sullivan and not an India seething with discontent and convulsed by the throes of an incipient revolution.\n\nAs to the \"enlarged\" Legislative Councils, we can say little. Mr. Morley does not enlighten us as to their composition but he has explicitly said that the official majority will be maintainedâ€”a piece of information, by the way, which the *Bengalee*'s \"Own Correspondents\" forget to cable out to Colootola. That is enough for it means that the Legislative Councils are to be precisely what they were before, only bigger. The people are not to be given any effective control or check on the management of their own affairs. We had gilded shams before; they will be bigger shams with more gilt on them, but still shams and nothing but shams.\n\nFinally, Mr. Morley says that the time has come when it will be really quite safe to have an Indian or even two (what reckless daring!) on the India Council. Really? A year or two ago, we suppose, it would have been very dangerous,â€”indeed, brought the Empire down with a sudden crash. So Mr. Romesh <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> and Justice Amir Ali's expectations may at last be satisfied and we shall have two Indian tongues in the Council of India.

Mr. Bose is an educationist pure and simple who has never mixed himself up in politics, unlike another well-known principal whose weekly incursions into politics are more remarkable for their manner than for their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>. If therefore Mr. Bose had confined himself to the educational aspect of the question and the extent to which students may permissibly interest themselves in politics, we should have had nothing to say. Unfortunately Mr. Bose has allowed himself to be tempted by the prevailing political atmosphere outside his true province. He refrains from discussing the merits of the Risley Circular and merely advises the public to leave no stone unturned to get the circular withdrawn but to refrain scrupulously from defying it while it is in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. This is very much like telling us to leave no stone unturned to get our dinner cooked but at the same time refrain scrupulously from lighting a fire. Everyone, even the veriest political tyro, can see that if we submit to the circular it will remain with us in perpetuity; no amount of representations such as it is now proposed to send to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>, will get the circular recalled.

Today they have been received by some with scorn and ridicule, by others with bitterness and dissatisfaction, even by the most loyal with a cold and qualified recognition. Never has an important pronouncement of policy by a famous and once honoured statesman of whom much had been expected, delivered moreover under the most dramatic circumstances possible and as a solution of a trying and critical problem, fallen so utterly flat on the audience which it was intended to impress. The outside world amazed at a change so sudden and radical may well ask what are its causes. The true cause is, of course, the revolution which has been worked in Indian opinion and Indian feeling in these two years. British Liberalism stands where it was and refuses to move forward. Indian opinion has advanced with enormous strides to a position far in front. The British Liberal has perhaps, from his standpoint, some reason for complaint. He had formed a sort of agreement with the section of Indian opinion which then dominated Indian politics. On our side we were to assure him of the permanence of the British control, to acknowledge our present unfitness for self-government and to accept perpetual subordination and dependence as an arrangement of Providence. On his side he has engaged to give us progressive alleviations of our subject condition, gradually increasing compensations for the renunciation<span class='page-number' id='s-500' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.500]</span> of our national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>; these he was prepared to concede to us by slow degrees according to his own convenience and ability. Nor was the prospect denied to India of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> after the lapse of many centuries a trusted servant of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> or even something very like an adopted son. The bargain was one-sided, but the political leaders had an overpowering sense of their own weakness, of the superior excellence of British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, and of the unshakable might of Britain. They had too a profound trust in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> of England and the genuineness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> Liberalism. They believed that the Liberal offers of small rights and privileges were made not as a bargain or out of a shrewd calculation of advantages and disadvantages, but from the sense of justice and from a true sympathy with liberal aspirations <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> over the world. They were therefore ready to take gratefully and contentedly whatever small mercies were conceded to them.\n\nNow the spirit of the people has changed. From a timid and easily satisfied dependence on the alien they have passed at once to a passionate and determined assertion of their separate national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and a demand for an immediate recognition of their right to control their own affairs. It is not surprising that the old Friends of India should be alarmed and indignant at the change or that they should <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> upon the older leaders whom they know and think they can influence, to drive the Extremists out of their councils, return to their old allegiance and observe the terms of the contract. \"We are where we were, we still offer you the same terms;\" they cry, \"you shall have your reforms, but on the old conditions, the permanence of British control, the repression of all turbulent aspirations, dissociation from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of disorder and revolution.\" So they cry to the Moderate leaders to turn back and retrace their steps, and by main <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> to bring back India with them to the standpoint of twenty years ago. It is a vain cry. If the Moderate leaders wished to go back, they would have to go back alone as men without a following, lost leaders, prophets whose power had passed out of them. The force which has swept the country forward is a force no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> has created and which no man can control. As well ask a man who has become adult to return to the age of childhood as India<span class='page-number' id='s-50 to go back to the standpoint it has left irrecoverably behind.' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.50 to go back to the standpoint it has left irrecoverably behind.]</span>\n\nThe British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> is like Tarquin with the Sibyl; the terms it has refused will no longer be offered to it. It might have purchased contentment, a new lease of Indian confidence and a long spell of ease at a very small price only three or four years ago. Now at a price ten times as high it will be able to purchase at the most a short truce in a war which must be fought to the end. Mr. Morley recognised this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> when with an indiscreet frankness he referred to the educated class in India as \"our enemies\". A long era of repression and reaction culminating in Curzonism has opened the eyes of the Indian people. They have learnt that not only were the reforms of Liberal Viceroys and Governments small and ineffective in themselves, but that they were held on a precarious tenure. Mr. Morley or another might give \"rights\" and \"privileges\" of a dubious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, but the power of Liberalism in modern England is apt to be brief and succeeded by long periods of pure <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Imperialism</span> in which those rights and privileges will surely be taken away or nullified. They have discovered also that the support they might expect from Liberalism is of a very limited and meagre <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> and that, when in office, Liberal and Conservative are for India synonymous terms. The struggle which began with the Partition has generated a new ideal and a newborn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> has sprung in a few days almost to its full stature. There was no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> therefore that any reform would be acceptable which did not ensure popular control, make reactionary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>legislation</span> by despotic Viceroys impossible and open the way to Swaraj. And even if Mr. Morley's reforms had had any chance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> acceptable, it was ruined by the series of repressive measures which preceded them. Reforms simultaneous and compatible with the deportation of popular leaders, the prosecution of popular journals, the persecution of students and teachers and the prohibition of public meetings were of so patent a hollowness that the most moderate and loyal were compelled to receive them with a bitter scepticism. And as if to drive the moral home, the speech in which the reforming statesman introduced his measures was couched in the sour and autocratic spirit of a reactionary bureaucrat contemptuously<span class='page-number' id='s-502' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.502]</span> doling out sops to the rabble to an accompaniment of hardly-veiled menace and insult. Mr. Morley has been unanimously complimented by the Liberal Press in England on his courage in coupling repression with reforms, kicks with bread-crumbs.

He asked Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span> to confirm his statement of the 6th June, that Lajpat Rai's speeches had greatly dominated sedition in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> and had been published broadcast, even on the floor of the House. The statement shows that Mr. Morley thinks he knows more about Indian affairs than we Indians do; and his reference, obviously, was to Members of the Parliament like Sir Henry Cotton who tease the Secretary of State for India with inconvenient questions about Indian subjects. With characteristic conceit Mr. Morley replied that he should be very unlikely to make a statement without providing himself with fair and reasonable confirmation. It was surely such \"fair and reasonable confirmation\" that enabled him, the other day, to make an assertion about the proposed Victoria Memorial Hall which even the perverse ingenuity of the Anglo-Indian Press could not support. And it was surely such fair and reasonable confirmation that made him beat a retreat on the present occasion with the sage remark that nothing would be more injudicious than to lay the facts on the table. Only deeds of darkness need be afraid of light. And people may be pardoned if they dare suspect that the fair and reasonable confirmation was as real as Mr. Morley's reforms so often advertised by himself as well as by the *Statesman*. Next when Mr. Mackarness asked whether it was intended to formulate a definite legal charge against Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh and also what the length of their banishment and confinement would be, Mr. Morley said<span class='page-number' id='s-504' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.504]</span> that he was unable at present to state the intentions of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> of India. It seems that as far as questions on matters Indian are concerned the British House of Commons is as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> as the Indian Legislative Councils. The reason is not far to seek.

It proceeds by compromises and half-measures. But this cautious policy has been justified by results. The advance, if slow, is sure, and a persistent well-reasoned agitation seldom fails to achieve its end. An example of the success which rewards perseverance is to be found in Mr. Morley's announcement that a Committee has been appointed to examine the distribution of the costs of the Indian Army as between the War Office and the Indian taxpayer.\"\n\nSo the Indian is asked to accept the so-called concessions in no carping spirit, not to demand more like Oliver Twist but to remember that beggars must not be choosers. But why should Englishmen interested in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> be so anxious to confer concessions on Indians who in their present self-respecting mood are not likely to appreciate the generosity of the donors?

Where the ordinary law does not cover <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the conceivable offences against the interests of the foreigner ordinances and ukases can easily be invented to put a stop to undesirable activities as we have lately seen. Thus the bureaucratic machinery grinds slow or grinds fast, but grinding is its object. In the ordinary course of things we do not become immediately conscious of its baneful consequence; but when the bureaucracy is face to face with an adverse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> or interest it at once sets itself to the work of repression with all its demoralising consequences.

We must first realise that we are great and glorious, that we are proud and noble, and it is through voluntary prostration that we are being stamped into the dust. No material ideal of riches and prosperity has ever made a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. But when the sense of honour has been touched, when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of greatness has been reawakened, then and then only have the scattered units of a fallen nation clustered round <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> mighty moral force.\n\nWhat is now considered by political thinkers to be the chief incentive to conquest? What is the meaning of the imperial sentiment which is \"now dominating every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> breast\"? \"If we ask ourselves,\" says one writer, \"seriously the question why we glory in the magnitude of our empire, it may be answered: partly because we think it adds to our riches, partly because we enjoy the sense of power and dominion, partly because we cling to old traditions and remember the great deeds of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>; but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> and above all these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of satisfaction we feel that throughout the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British empire</span> we enforce those ideas of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and religious toleration which are the results of the constitutional struggles of centuries.\" We are not concerned here with the discussion whether the Britisher's boast is well or ill-founded, but rightly or wrongly this sentiment has taken possession of him and he is invincible under its influence. For we find the same explanation in Mill. Sidgwick also in his *Elements of Politics* harps on the same strain. \"Besides the material advantages,\" he says, \"there are legitimate sentimental satisfactions derived from justifiable conquest which must be taken into account. Such are the justifiable pride which the cultivated members of a civilised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> feel in the beneficent exercise of dominion and in the performance by their nation of the noble task of spreading the highest kind of civilisation, and a more intense though less elevated satisfactionâ€”inseparable<span class='page-number' id='s-512' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.512]</span> from patriotic sentimentâ€”in the spread of the special type of civilisation distinctive of their nation, communicated through its language and literature, and through the tendency to catch its tastes and imitate its customs which its prolonged rule, specially if, on the whole, beneficent, is likely to cause in a continually increasing degree.\"\n\nThus, according to Sidgwick, physical expansion proceeds from a desire for spiritual expansion and history also supports the assertion. But why should not India then be the first power in the world? Who else has the undisputed right to extend spiritual sway over the world? This was Swami Vivekananda's plan of campaign. India can once more be made conscious of her greatness by an overmastering sense of the greatness of her spirituality. This sense of greatness is the main feeder of all patriotism. This only can put an end to all self-depreciation and generate a burning desire to recover the lost ground.<span class='page-number' id='s-513' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.513]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-main-feeder-of-patriotism","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Concerted Action","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/concerted-action","prvt":"Look on This Picture and Then on That","prvu":"/cwsa/07/look-on-this-picture-and-then-on-that","dt":"1907-06-19","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["concerted-action"],"t":"Concerted Action","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We publish in another column a letter from a correspondent signing himself \"Organised Co-operation\", in which a very elaborate plan is sketched out for ascertaining the opinion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and following out in unison the programme arrived at.

A plebiscite can only be on a single definite and supreme issue, the decision of which is so important that the ordinary representative assemblies cannot undertake the responsibility of a final decision. A plebiscite on a whole programme is an impossibility. Neither would it be binding. Bengal, for instance, is practically unanimous for Boycott. If the majority of votes went against Boycott, would Bengal accept the decision and tamely submit to repression? Or if the majority were for Boycott, would Bombay City agree to carry out the decision?

We were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the recipients of the Bengal Government's letter, and if we have not written on the subject, it is simply because the letter was marked confidential. Now, however, that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> has got abroad, we may as well correct certain inaccuracies which have appeared not only in the *Statesman*'s bit of romancing, but in the *Amrita Bazar Patrika*'s correction. It is entirely untrue that on Monday afternoon or any other afternoon, evening or morning \"a notice was served upon the proprietors, editor, manager and printer of this paper to the effect that proceedings would be adopted against them under section 124A and the other sections dealing with seditious publications, unless they moderated their tone\". On Saturday before last, if our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span> serves us, we received a communication from the Bengal Government addressed to the Editor, *Bande Mataram*, in which we were informed that the Lieutenant-Governor had had under consideration certain articles (not specified) recently published in our paper \"the language of which was a direct incitement to violence and breach of the peace\". This sort of language the Bengal Government was determined to put a stop to, but before taking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> they were gracious enough to give us a warning to mend our ways. That is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>. It is not true either that a conference was held with the directors or that the manager interviewed the legal<span class='page-number' id='s-515' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.515]</span> advisers of the Company in connection with the notice. No such conference or interview was held for the simple reason that none was necessary. The Editorial Department is solely responsible for the policy of the paper and they have no need to consult lawyers about their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to the public. The *Amrita Bazar Patrika* is therefore wrongly informed when it says that legal opinion has been taken and given in the matter. It is true that legal opinion is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> taken by the Company, but it is on a point of law which arose previous to the receipt of the Bengal Government's letter and is entirely unconnected with it. The *Statesman* has also absurdly distorted the \"proceedings against the *Yugantar* and *Nabasakti*\". No proceedings have been instituted. The police while searching the Keshab Press for manuscripts in connection with the pamphlet *Sonar Bangla*â€”which has, by the way, no connection with the Hare Street mare's nestâ€”stumbled on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of the *Yugantar* then being printed. The Keshab Press is being proceeded against, but it is doubtful whether anything will be done to the *Yugantar*, as the printing of a paper in part or whole at another press in emergency is so common an occurrence that, even if it be a technical offence, which is not certain, to prosecute it would be purely vindictive. In any case the *Yugantar* <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> is not, as the *Statesman* represents, the first step in a campaign against the Nationalist Press. Our own position is very simple. The articles to which the Bengal Government refers, are, we presume, those in which we called upon the Hindus to defend their temples and their women from insult and outrage. Every Hindu paper at the time did the same, even the *Indian Mirror* and the *Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nation</span>*, and we do not think we did anything more than our plain duty to our countrymen. The Lieutenant-Governor, however, takes exception not to the purport of our articles but to their languageâ€”which was less violent than what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> papers would have used if a similar campaign of outrage on European women had been in progress. Be that as it may, the occasion has passed and until it is repeated, the question of complying or not complying with the warning does not arise. We merely note it and pass on.<span class='page-number' id='s-516' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.516]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-bengal-governments-letter","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"British Justice","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/british-justice","prvt":"Concerted Action","prvu":"/cwsa/07/concerted-action","dt":"1907-06-20","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["british-justice"],"t":"British Justice","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"There has been much to edify and instruct in the recent antics of the bureaucracy and, in the light of the object lessons they present, the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> have been revising old ideas and outworn superstitions with a healthy rapidity.

But the greatest fall of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> has been the fall of the belief in the imperturbable impartiality of British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>. There are two kinds of strain which no empire, however firmly bound in triple and quadruple bands of steel, can long bear; the strain of a burden of taxation which the people no longer find bearable and the strain of a series of perversions of justice which destroy all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in the motives of the governing authorities. Justice and protection between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and man, between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> and community, between rulers and ruled is the main object for which States exist, for which men submit to the restrictions of the law and to an equitable assessment of the expenses of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> which provides for protection and justice. But if the assessment of the expenses is grossly unjust, if the expenses themselves are exorbitantly high, if the revenue is spent on ways of which the taxpayers do not approve, then protection and justice are bought at a price which is not worth paying. And if in addition the protection is denied and the justice withheld, then the very object of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of a State ceases to be satisfied and from that moment the governing power, unless it can retrace its steps, is doomed by the inevitable operation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-517' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.517]</span>\n\nThe bureaucrats who misgovern us at the present moment have totally forgotten these simple truths. Otherwise we would not have witnessed such scandalous scenes as are now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> enacted at Rawalpindi or the gross infringements of equity and justice which are of frequent occurrence in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. The amazing incidents of the Rawalpindi riot case are such as have hardly been paralleled in British India. The refusal of bail, which was the first scandal, has evidently become a part of bureaucratic policy. It is a sound principle of procedure that bail should not be refused except under exceptional conditions, such as the probability of the accused absconding, otherwise in a protracted case an innocent man may suffer seriously for the sole offence of being accused. In the Rawalpindi case there was not the least possibility of men like Lala Hansraj, Gurdas Ram or Janaki Nath absconding from justice and the apprehension of further riots in a city commanded by siege-guns and crowded with military was a contemptible and hollow pretence. Yet without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> the case, on the mere statement of the prosecuting officials, the Chief Court of the Punjab, supposed to be the highest repository of impartial British Justice, prejudged the accused, declared them guilty and refused bail. This is British law and British justice! Again in the course of the present trial, although it was proved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> dispute that the prisoners were suffering terribly in health as the result of a detention in which they are being deliberately subjected to unnecessary discomfort and privation, although, if there was ever any shadow of justification for the refusal of bail, even that shadow had by this time utterly vanished, yet on the strength of the airy persiflage of a Civil Surgeon the relief to which they were entitled was refused. This gentleman held the view that the sufferings of the accused were not due to their detention and seems to be of the opinion that men of means and gentle nurture are rather in the habit of shedding several pounds of flesh off and on without apparent cause. And so the unfortunate martyrs, for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> of being patriots, are punished with a long term of imprisonment before any offence has been proved against them. This too is British law and British justice. From the point<span class='page-number' id='s-518' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.518]</span> of view of the executive it may no doubt be said that since the accused have to be punished whether they are guilty or innocent, it does not much <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> whether their punishment begins before or after their conviction. That is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> reasoning from the point of view of a bureaucratic executive, but not from that of a judicial authority. The refusal of bail to the Rawalpindi pleaders is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the most deadly of the many wounds which the bureaucracy have been recently dealing to their own moral prestige and reputation for justice. The same spirit has been shown in the refusal of bail to Pindi <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Das</span>, editor of *India*, and to Lala Dinanath of the *Hindustan*. In the latter case there is absolutely no excuse whatever for the refusal, except the vindictive fury of bureaucratic persecution which will omit no means however petty and base to make its opponents suffer.\n\nBut the most glaringly, paradoxically unsound case of all has occurred in our own midst. Srijut Girindranath Sen received at the hands of British justice a sentence of monstrous severity for a trifling offence. This same British justice being moved to set aside the conviction and sentence, was graciously pleased to give the accused a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of disproving the offence, but at the same time, in the plenitude of its justice and wisdom, refused to give him bail. In other words it admitted that the accused might be innocent, but at the same time decided that he must undergo a monstrously disproportionate punishment for a trifling offence of which it was admittedly doubtful whether he ever committed it! And then when the punishment had been served out, British justice lent a gracious and leisurely ear and admitted that this Swadeshi Volunteer Captain was very probably innocent, but as he had suffered punishment for his innocence, it was not necessary to go any further into the matter. This too is British law and British justice. If all this does not convince the Indian people that the British sense of justice is most marvellous and unique and *sui generis* and without any peer or parallel in the world, it must indeed be hard-hearted and dull of soul. For our part we are ready to acclaim British justice with hymns of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> and praise.

We may have to resort to this means of protest for some time to come until the Britishers so far forget themselves as to begin firing on strikers and boycottersâ€”a contingency for which the country should now learn to be prepared. If the despot still entertains some doubt as to the working of the time-spirit, it should be set at rest by the instinctive resort of the Coconada coolies to a wholesale strike as an effective protest against the arrest of some of their own people for alleged participation in a riot. The drafting of the military and the punitive police to the locality has perhaps strengthened their firmness. The *Englishman* while alarmed at this unexpected combination among the lower class, hopes that the strike is not political in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>.

They cannot be cowed down into submission with half the ease and celerity with which the educated classes can be brought down by the display of military strength.\" The whole plan of Nationalist campaign rests on the basis of this potential strength of the people which does not require for its reawakening years of mass <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> as is contended by the<span class='page-number' id='s-520' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.520]</span> Moderates, but only tangible instances of bureaucratic highhandedness.

Yesterday the Friend of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> noticed the incident with great sympathy for Sir Howard Vincent's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, but it could not altogether approve of applying his panacea just at present. The Friend, however, looks forward to a day when the shooting will begin; it invites the attention of the Indian reactionariesâ€”whoever they may beâ€”to this bloodcurdling Howard Vincent war-whoop and warns them that this is the prospect before them if a Tory <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> comes into power while the present unrest continues. By its Indian reactionaries the Friend probably means not Nawab Salimullah and the *Mihir Sudhakar*, but the Democratic Nationalist party in India; for the Friendly language must be usually interpreted by contraries, and it is quite natural for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> who calls the *Statesman* a Friend of India to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationalism</span> reactionary.

The defenders of the established <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> of things have attempted almost every form of Russian repression except the taking of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. Deportation, condemnation without trial, punishment before conviction, flogging, the gagging of press and platform, police hooliganism, the employment of a Black Hundred, brutal personal persecution in jail and *hajat*, have all been attempted though not as yet on the Russian scale. When all these methods have been found ineffective, it is quite possible that the order \"do not hesitate to shoot\" may go out; already in the Punjab the threat has been used to prevent public meetings. The Friend of India is greatly mistaken if he thinks that his menaces will have any better effect than his abuse and cajolings: it is a wild dream for him to hope that any power can make Indian Nationalism fall down and kiss the feet of Archangel John.<span class='page-number' id='s-522' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.522]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-statesman-on-shooting","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Mr. A.

This is the second time that Mr. Chaudhuri has had an opportunity of this kind, the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> the Provincial conference at Burdwan. On that occasion he made a pronouncement which indicated a new departure in politics and created some flutter in the Congress dovecotes. It would not be accurate to say that the Burdwan pronunciamento influenced the course of affairs; the propounder of the new policy, if such it could be called, had not sufficient weight of personality to become the leader of a new party, nor was his policy either definite enough or sound enough to attract a following. But it had a certain importance. It was the immature self-expression of ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> which had been gathering head in the country and groping about for means of entry into the ordinary channels of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. It was rather the prophecy of a new turn in Indian politics than itself a policy already understood and matured. The prophet himself was perhaps the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> who least understood his own prophecy. The confusion of his ideas was shown soon afterwards by his identifying himself with the old current of Congress politics and thus turning his back on the two main positions in his Burdwan speech, the repudiation of mendicant politics and the dictum that a subject <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> has no politics. He left it to others to develop the political ideas he had dimly and imperfectly outlined and give them a definite shape embodied in a clear political programme. Still more forcibly is this lack of comprehension evidenced by Mr. Chaudhuri's attempt to revert, with modifications, to his<span class='page-number' id='s-523' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.523]</span> Burdwan ideas even after the momentous changes of the last three years. He has once more reverted to his dictum that a subject nation has no politics; he once more proposes that we should give up our political agitation; once more he puts forward self-help as a substitute. When he spoke at Burdwan, industrial expansion was the idea of the day and Mr. Chaudhuri offered it to us as a substitute for political mendicancy. Today Swadeshi, Boycott and National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span> are the ideas of the day and Mr. Chaudhuri offers them as a substitute for the struggle for Swaraj.\n\nWe do not wish to overrate the importance of Mr. Chaudhuri's pronouncements. Mr. Chaudhuri is not a political leader with a distinct following in the country who are likely to carry out his ideas. He is a sort of Rosebery of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> politics, a brilliant, cultured amateur, who catches up certain thoughts or tendencies that are in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> and gives them a more or less striking expression, but he has not the qualities of a politicianâ€”robustness, backbone, the ability to will a certain course of action and the courage to carry it out. He has intellectual sensitiveness, but not intellectual consistency. Suave, affable, pliable, essentially an amiable and cultured gentleman, he is unfit for the rough and tumble of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, especially in a revolutionary period; no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who shrinks from struggle or is appalled by the thought of aggression can hope to seize and lead the wild forces that are rising to the surface in twentieth-century <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. But this very knack of catching up however partially the moods of the moment gives a certain interest to Mr. Chaudhuri's pronouncements which make them worth examining.\n\nWhen Mr. Chaudhuri at Burdwan pronounced against the mendicant policy he was voicing two distinct and various currents of political tendency. The opprobrious term of mendicancy was applied to the old Congress school of politics not because remonstrance and protest are in themselves wrong and degrading, but because in the circumstances of modern India a policy of prayer, petition and protest without the sanction of a great irresistible national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> at its back was bound to pauperise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of the nation and to accustom it to a degrading<span class='page-number' id='s-524' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.524]</span> dependence. It was not only a waste of energy but a sapping of energy, and it was ruinous to manhood and self-respect. But the recognition of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> only led to another problem. If we did not sue to others for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span>, we must help ourselves; if we did not depend on the alien's mercies, we must depend on our own strength. But how was that strength to be educated? Again, when we had decided that a subject nation has no politics, what then? Were we to renounce the birthrights inherent in our manhood and leave the field to the bureaucratic despotism or were we to resolve to cease to be a subject nation so that we might recover the right and possibility of political life and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>? There were two currents of political thought growing up in the country. One, thoughtful, philosophic, idealistic, dreamed of ignoring the terrible burden that was crushing us to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, of turning away from politics and educating our strength in the village and township, developing our resources, our social, economic, religious life regardless of the intrusive alien; it thought of inaugurating a new revolution such as the world had never yet seen, a moral, peaceful revolution, actively developing ourselves but only passively resisting the adversary. But there was another current submerged as yet, but actively working underneath, which tended in another direction,â€”a sprinkling of men in whom one fiery conviction replaced the cultured broodings of philosophy and one grim resolve took the place of political reasoning. The conviction was that subjection was the one curse which withered and blighted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> our national activities, that so long as that curse was not removed it was a vain dream to expect our national activities to develop themselves successfully and that only by struggle could our strength be educated to action and victory. The resolve was to rise and fight and fall and again rise and fight and fall waging the battle for ever until this once great and free nation should again be great and free. It was this last current which boiled up to the surface in the first vehemence of the anti-Partition agitation, flung out the challenge of boycott and plunged the Bengali nation into a struggle with the bureaucracy which must now be fought out till the end.\n\nAll were carried away in the tide of that great upheaval;<span class='page-number' id='s-525' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.525]</span> but it is needless to say that this was not what the advocates of self-help pure and simple had contemplated, Mr. Chaudhuri least of all. He very early identified himself with the small knot of older leaders who from time to time struggled with the tide and tried to turn it back; but until now the tide was too strong for them. For a moment, however, the rush has been checked by superhuman efforts of repression on the part of the panic-stricken bureaucracy and it is natural that those who were not with their whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and conviction for the struggle for Swaraj, should begin to revert to their old ideas, to long to give up the struggle, to retreat into the fancied security of their fortress of unpolitical Swadeshism and a policy of self-help which seeks to ignore the unignorable. The tendency is to cry, \"The old policy is a failure, the Briton has revealed his true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>; the new policy is a failure, we have not strength to meet the giant power of the bureaucracy; let them have the field, let us quietly pursue our own salvation in the peaceful Ashrams of Swadeshism and self-help.\" Mr. Ashutosh Chaudhuri with his keen intellectual sensitiveness has felt this tendency in the air and given it expression. It is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and pathetic dream. We will develop our manufacture, boycott foreign goods, of course in a quite friendly and non-political spirit, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> will look quietly on while its trade is being ruined! We will ignore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> and build up our own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of strength in spite of it, a Government the whole principle and condition of whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> is that there shall be no centre of strength in the country except itself! Mr. Chaudhuri's policy would be an excellent one if he could only remove two factors from the political problem, first, Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, secondly, the British Government. And how does he propose to remove them? By shutting his eyes to their existence. Ignore the Government, dissociate yourselves from the men of violenceâ€”and the thing is done. Such is the political wisdom of Mr. Ashutosh Chaudhuri.<span class='page-number' id='s-526' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.526]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/mr-a-chaudhuris-policy","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"A Current Dodge","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-current-dodge","prvt":"The Statesman on Shooting","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-statesman-on-shooting","dt":"1907-06-22","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-current-dodge"],"t":"A Current Dodge","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Referring to the transfer to other places of Mr. Barneville and Maulavi Faizuddin Hossein who tried cases of looting in Jamalpur and recorded as their opinion that the riots were not provoked by Hindu boycotters and National volunteers, even the *Hindu Patriot* which has never been friendly to the Nationalist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> writesâ€”\n\n\"Transferring judges and magistrates whose decisions differ from the settled policy or preconceived views of the Executive officials, is a current dodge whereby the ends of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> are sought to be subordinated to political or other considerations.

But the first principle of bureaucratic rule in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> is repression, to crush the spirit of the people and keep them down with the strong hand. Every acquittal is therefore considered by the executive a defeat to Government prestige and resented.

In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> such men are rarities upon the Bench; in India especially among Civilian Magistrates and Judges, they are not uncommon. In England the prosecuting Counsel will seldom throw unnecessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> in the way of the defence, in India it is too common for the prosecuting Counsel to regard the defence as an enemy to be beaten down and out-manoeuvred by any means which the technicalities of the law leave open to him. For the atmosphere is different. The spirit of bureaucracy in all countries tends to be narrow, hard and domineering, but in a country where a small alien element subsists in a huge native mass partly by the maintenance of a hypnotic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>, partly by a cold legal repressive severity, ubiquitous and watchful to crush down every least unit of strength in the indigenous population, this temper is immensely heightened and exaggerated. Everybody knows that in the local administration of the law in this country conviction, not impartial justice, is the object. A Subordinate Magistrate is rated not by the soundness of his judgments but by the percentage of convictions to the total number of cases he has tried, and it is by this test that he is promoted. In that single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> we find the true and fundamental tendency of British justice in India.\n\nWhen such is the spirit even in the ordinary administration of the law, it can easily be imagined to what lengths this spirit of semi-mediaeval barbarity is likely to be carried when political considerations are imported. To get justice in a Swadeshi case is nowadays almost impossible; even in the High Court only one or two judges have managed to keep a judicial frame of<span class='page-number' id='s-529' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.529]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> in relation to political cases. This is of course natural and inevitable. A struggle is going on between the ruling bureaucracy and the people of the country, and every judge or magistrate is a servant of the bureaucracy, generally a member of it and very often himself one of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> and race whose monopoly of power is threatened. In his eyes the accused in a political case is not an ordinary accused but a rebel prisoner of war; he may not be guilty of the offence with which he is charged, but he is guilty of Swadeshism, he is guilty of being an opponent of the Government established by law. His punishment is therefore desirable in the interests of the ruling class and in the judge's own interests as a servant and member of that class. The judge is really a party to the case. It is not to be expected that in such circumstances any facilities will be allowed to the defence <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> what the letter of the law and bare decency require. A few magistrates may rise superior to these considerations, but the majority cannot be reasonably asked to do so. They are after all human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span>â€”and Englishmen.\n\nStill there is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span>, there is something due to decency, and at Rawalpindi it seems to us that the limit has been overpassed and the dues have been denied. We have nothing to say as to the guilt or the innocence of the men under trial. We will assume that they are guilty, we will assume that their conviction is a thing settled. But still until the trial is over, they are in law regarded as men who are possibly innocent and should be allowed ordinary facilities to prove their innocence. One of the principal safeguards of accused innocents in India is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of identification under stringent rules which prevent collusion between the police and the witnesses. In the Rawalpindi trial it has been repeatedly stated that the identification has been a scandalous farce; the prisoners have been under police custody all the time and have been repeatedly shown to the witnesses in the jail, and as if this were not enough, the police in Court are allowed to make signs to the witnesses so that they may be sure to identify the right persons. These statements have not been denied. They may be true or they may be false; but when such statements are advanced by the defence, it is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of an impartial judge to<span class='page-number' id='s-530' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.530]</span> inquire into them and take every precaution against the barest possibility of such practices. Piteous complaints have been made by several of the accused of police violence and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cruelty</span> in *hajat*. Into this also no inquiry has been made and the only answer the unfortunate men have received is a rough and uncivil command to keep silence.\n\nIf this were all, it would be scandalous enough, but the recent developments have been still more staggering. A hooligan crusade has been started against the pleaders for the defence, so shamelessly persistent and open as to drive them to throw up their briefs. Sirdar Beant Singh's house has been invaded, himself and his brother brutally assaulted, his ladies' apartments entered and an ornament snatched from the person of his wife. While these brutal outrages were being committed, the police remained quiet in their *thana* which is in the same compound as the Sirdar's house and made no attempt to give assistance, nor do we hear of any attempt to trace and punish the miscreants. The houses of other defence pleaders have been exposed to a campaign of theft and pilfering and none of them is safe against a repetition of the kind of intimidation which has been used against Beant Singh. All India has drawn its own conclusions from these singular occurrences, for indeed, the conclusions are not difficult to draw.\n\nBut the crowning scandal of all was the treatment of the witness Abdullah. It is possible that seditious speeches were delivered by the accused, but it is certain that the amazing literal unanimity of the witnesses has created, rightly or wrongly, an impression that their evidence was given according to police dictation. When, therefore, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> witness actually declared in the witness box that his first evidence has been given under <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of the police, it was obvious that the whole foundation of the prosecution case was threatened; for the example of recantation might easily be followed. Then ensued a scene which we hope, for the credit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> at large, has never had a parallel in recent judicial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. Immediately the prosecuting counsel leaps up and demands that this inconvenient witness be at once prosecuted for perjury and handed over to the tender mercies<span class='page-number' id='s-531' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.531]</span> of the police against whom he has given evidence; immediately the judge complies with this amazing demand; immediately the unfortunate witness is hustled out of court into the grip of the police. It is not surprising that the miserable Abdullah should recant his recantation and balance his charge against the police by a charge against the leading pleader for the defence. And this too is British law and British justice. Nay, it is the climax, the apex, the acme, the culminating point which British justice has reached in this too fortunate country. After all, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span> must be saved at any cost.<span class='page-number' id='s-532' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.532]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/more-about-british-justice","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Morleyism Analysed","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/morleyism-analysed","prvt":"A Current Dodge","prvu":"/cwsa/07/a-current-dodge","dt":"1907-06-24","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["morleyism-analysed"],"t":"Morleyism Analysed","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The fuller reports of Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s speech to hand by mail do not in any essential point alter the impression that was produced by *Reuter*'s summary. The whole of the speech turns upon a single sentence as its pivotâ€”the statement that British rule will continue, ought to continue and must continue. Mr. Morley does not say for ever, but that is understood. It follows that if the continuance of British rule on any terms is the fundamental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>, any and every means used for its preservation is legitimate.

The principles of Liberalism, though they may have been professed a thousand times over, must be discarded by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> rulers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> as inapplicable to a country of \"300 millions of people, composite, heterogeneous, of different races with different histories and different faiths\". <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> these things weigh as dust in the balance against the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> supreme necessity. If the continuance of British rule seems to be threatened by any popular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> however legitimate, resort must be had to any weapon, no matter of what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to put down that activity. Reasons of State, \"the tyrant's plea, necessity\", must be held to be of supreme authority and to override all other considerations. Mr. Morley admits that the plea is a dangerous one, but sedition is still more dangerous. The danger of the reason of State is that it can cover and will inevitably be stretched to cover the repetition of \"dangers, mischiefs and iniquities in our olden <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> and, perhaps, in our present history\"; in other words Mr. Morley's reasoning in favour of the present \"iniquities\" in India<span class='page-number' id='s-533' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.533]</span> can equally well be used to justify every utmost atrocity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cruelty</span>, vileness with which tyrants ancient or modern have attempted to put down opposition to their sovereign will. Wholesale deportation, arbitrary imprisonment, massacre, outrage, police anarchy, torture of prisoners, every familiar feature of Russian repression, can be brought under the head of weapons necessary to combat sedition and can be justified by the plea of State necessity. This is the danger of reason of State, a danger that recent events in India and especially current events in the Punjab show to be by no means so remote as we might have some months ago imagined. But the danger of sedition is the cessation of British rule. And in the opinion of Mr. Morley, supported by an almost unanimous consensus of British opinion, the re-enactment by a British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> of the iniquities and atrocities of ancient and modern tyranny are preferable to the cessation of British rule; it is better to take the risk of these than to take the risk of losing the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> control of Britain over India. This is Mr. Morley's argument, approved by Conservative and Radical alike. No, we are not distorting or exaggerating. There it is, plump and plain, in the speech of the great British Radical, the Liberal philosopher, the panegyrist of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burke</span> and Gladstone. It is the last word of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> to India on the great issue of Indian self-government.\n\nWhat does Mr. Morley mean by British rule? Not the British connexion, not the continuance of India as a self-governing unit in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>federation</span> of free peoples which shall be called the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span>. No, Mr. Morley is quite as hostile to the Moderate ideal of self-government on colonial lines, modified Swaraj, as to the Nationalist ideal of Swaraj pure and simple. The educated minority in India have the presumption to think themselves capable of working the government of the country as smoothly as the heaven-born Briton himself, but Mr. Morley is persuaded that they would not work it for a week. This is final. If after a hundred years of English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and no inconsiderable training in the subordinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the bureaucratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> of government, the educated class are not fit to be entrusted even by gradual stages with the supreme government of Indian affairs, then they will never be fit. And we must remember that the policy<span class='page-number' id='s-534' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.534]</span> of the rulers henceforth will be to control and restrict and not to encourage or promote the spread of education of the higher sort. From our own point of view, we may put it more strongly and say that if a hundred years of dependence and foreign control have so immensely impaired that governing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of the Indian races which they showed with such splendid results for the last three thousand years, then another century will absolutely and for ever destroy it. Mr. Morley is therefore logically justified in reiterating his conviction that personal and absolute foreign control must be the leading feature of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> to the very end of time. This is what Mr. Morley means by the continuance of British rule, he means the continuance of a personal and absolute British control pervading the administration of affairs in every department, in other words, a bureaucratic despotism strongly flavoured by the independent personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>omnipotence</span> of local governors and local officials. The problem which former British statesmen professed to have before them was the problem of gradually training and associating the Indians in an European system of government until they were fit to take over absolute control of affairs and allow their patrons and protectors to withdraw. This problem does not any longer trouble the peace of British statesmen; on the contrary it is definitely and for ever disclaimed and put aside as a chimeraâ€”or a pretence. British rule in India will continue, ought to continue and must continue. What then is the problem which is troubling Mr. Morley? The problem is \"the difficulty of combining personal government in our dependency with the rights of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>free speech</span> and free meeting\". Personal government, absolute government, despotism, that is the supreme necessity which must be continued for ever even at the sacrifice of morality, justice and every other consideration. Subject to that necessity Mr. Morley proposes to allow a certain amount of free speech if that be possible. Free speech was harmless so long as the Indian people had not set their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> on self-government; but now that they are resolved to have nothing short of self-government, free speech means seditious speech, and sedition is not consistent with the continuance of the absolute and personal British control. How then can free speech<span class='page-number' id='s-535' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.535]</span> and British despotism be combined? How can fire and water occupy the same space? That is the problem, which Mr. Morley refuses to believe insoluble, and he solves it by proclaiming the areas where free speech has been chiefly employed,â€”and by establishing an Advisory Council of Notables.\n\nIt may be asked, if the continuance of absolute government is the whole policy of British statesmanship, why does Mr. Morley trouble himself about free speech at all or propose any reforms? That question can be easily answered by a consideration of the suggested reforms. The first of these reforms is a Council of Notables. Mr. Morley has told us what is the object of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>; it is to be a sort of medium of communication between the Government and the people. Of course Mr. Morley is quite mistaken in supposing that such a body can really serve the object he has in view, but we are concerned for the present not with the sufficiency of the means he is devising for his object, but with the object itself. The second reform is an expansion of the Legislative Councils and greater facilities to the elected members for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of their views; in other words the object of the expanded Legislative Councils is to keep the Government in India in touch with the views of the educated class. The third reform is the admission of Indian members to the India Council, and it is obvious that here again the object is that these Indian members should keep the Government in England in touch with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> of educated India, just as the elected members of the Legislative Councils are to keep the Government in India in touch with the same opinion. The fourth reform is the decentralisation of the administration so that each local official may become an independent local despot. The object is clearly defined; first, to give him greater opportunities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> in touch with the people, secondly, to give him a greater power of personal despotic control within his own jurisdiction unhampered by the interference of higher authorities. All the reforms have one single object, one governing idea,â€”an absolute personal despotic British control *in touch with the people*. That is Mr. Morley's policy.\n\nThe object of keeping in touch with the people and knowing<span class='page-number' id='s-536' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.536]</span> their opinions is not to redress their grievances, still less to allow their opinions any control over the administration. The object is quite different. A despotism out of touch with the people is a despotism continually in danger; ignorant of the currents of opinion, ignorant of the half-visible activities among its subjects, ignorant of the perils gathering in the vast obscurity, it must one day be suddenly surprised and perhaps overthrown by the unforeseen outburst of activities and dangers it had not anticipated. It is in order to avoid these dangers that Mr. Morley wishes to employ various means of keeping in touch with public opinion and its manifestations. He talks in his speech of the necessity of the rulers putting themselves in the skins of the ruled, in other words, of thoroughly understanding their thoughts, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and point of view. This does not mean that they shall rule India according to the sentiments, views and wishes of the Indian people. The whole conduct of Mr. Morley and the whole trend of his utterances show that he means the opinions of the Government to prevail without regard to Indian opinions and sentiments. The rulers are to understand the ruled so that they may know how their measures are likely to affect the minds of the latter, how opposition can best be persuaded or *samjaoed* into quiescence and how, if persuasion is useless, it can most swiftly and successfully be crushed. Through the Council of Notables, the Legislative Councils and the Indian members of the India Council, the Government will come to know the ideas, views and feelings of the people; through the two former bodies they will try to present unpopular measures in such a way as to coax, cajole, delude or intimidate public opinion into a quiet acceptance. If they cannot do this, then through the decentralised local officers they can keep in touch with the popular temper, learn its manifestations and activities and successfully and promptly put down opposition by local measures, if possible, otherwise by imperial rescripts, laws and ordinances and every possible weapon of despotic repression.\n\nWe have analysed Mr. Morley's speech at length, because people in India have not the habit of following the turns of British parliamentary eloquence or reading between the lines of<span class='page-number' id='s-537' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.537]</span> the speech of a Cabinet Minister. They are therefore likely to miss its true bearings and fail to understand the policy it enunciates. Read by an eye accustomed to the reservations and implications by which a British Minister makes himself intelligible without committing himself unnecessarily, Mr. Morley's speech is an admirably clear, connected, logical and, let us add, unusually and amazingly frank expression of a very straightforward and coherent policy. To maintain in India an absolute rule as rigid as any Czar's, to keep that rule in close touch with the currents of Indian sentiment, opinion and activity and to crush any active opposition by an immediate resort to the ordinary weapons of despotism, ordinances, deportations, prosecutions and a swift and ruthless terrorism, this is Morleyism as explained by its author.<span class='page-number' id='s-538' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.538]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/morleyism-analysed","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Political or Non-Political","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/political-or-non-political","prvt":"More about British Justice","prvu":"/cwsa/07/more-about-british-justice","dt":"1907-06-25","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["political-or-non-political"],"t":"Political or Non-Political","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We are glad to see that both at Jessore and Pabna the foolish idea of excluding politics from a political conference has been entirely abandoned.

No doubt it would be extremely convenient for the Friend of India and its countrymen if Indians did give up their political aspirations and leave Anglo-India in undisputed possession of the field, but we do not think the friendly yearnings of the *Statesman* are likely to be gratified. Mr. Chaudhuri's message fell flat even in his own Pabna. At the same time our contemporary seems hardly to have taken the trouble to understand the speech of his new protÃ©gÃ©. He fastens on the powerful indictment of the present system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> which is the most striking portion of Mr. Chaudhuri's address, and warmly approves of it.

National Education will be a failure, says the Chowringhee prophet; Indians are too selfish and unpatriotic to make it a success. What then is to be done? Why, give up agitating for political reform since our agitation is so obviously a failure and begin agitating for educational reform. It is a luminous idea. After having wasted a century begging the British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> to reform their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>, we are to waste another century begging them to reform their educational system,â€”with equal futility. The Government cannot give us a reformed and modern system of education for obvious reasons. It would mean the growth of highly trained specialists who would immediately demand to be employed in preference to aliens, and either the bread of so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> Europeans would be taken out of their mouths or there would be a fresh cause of discontent.

We have looked up the dictionaries to profit by the enlightenment so kindly vouchsafed to us, but we have failed in our efforts.

Khulna is the first district in West Bengal which has set itself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and soul to the work of organizing Swadeshi and<span class='page-number' id='s-546' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.546]</span> Swaraj and Khulna suffers accordingly. This is the real reason of the attempts made by the Khulna officials to stop or punish the holding of Conferences. These District and Sub-divisional Conferences are especially dreaded by the bureaucracy because they know them to be the first step towards organization. We welcome the oppressions in Khulna because they mean the beginning of a true awakening in West Bengal. After its splendidly successful Conference Jessore ought to organize itself as Khulna has been doing. The Twenty-four Parganas and Midnapore will soon follow and as the organization spreads, the oppression will go with it and with the oppression will come the awakening.<span class='page-number' id='s-547' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.547]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/khulna-oppressions","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Secret Springs of Morleyism","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-secret-springs-of-morleyism","prvt":"\"Legitimate Patriotism\"","prvu":"/cwsa/07/legitimate-patriotism","dt":"1907-06-27","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-secret-springs-of-morleyism"],"t":"The Secret Springs of Morleyism","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The apostasy of John <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span> has come as a surprise and a scandal to that numerous class of believers in British professions who looked upon him as an *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>avatar</span>* of the spirit of philosophic Liberalism. To those who had studied the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> at closer quarters there was no disappointment and no surprise. As the *Kesari* pointed out in the early days of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>, the new Secretary of State might be a philosopher and defend human liberties in his books, but in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> Office he was bound to be a British statesman first of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> and defend the continuance of British supremacy in India. But apart from this the whole temper of Mr. Morley's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and the cast of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> made it quite certain that he would never be able to sympathise with the aspirations of our people and their claims to self-government and autonomy. It is true that Mr. Morley talks about the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of sympathy as the mainspring of Indian administration, but what is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of this sympathy? What Mr. Morley calls sympathy is not really sympathy but the patronising benevolence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> possessed of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> powers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> who is generous enough to give his bondslave as much <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> as is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> for him: in the process of that education he tries to be as indulgent as possible while reserving his right to scourge him occasionally for his own good and of course to appropriate all the profits of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for the master's own purse. The object of the education given to the slave is not to fit him for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> but to make him a more useful servant and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> whose appearance and manners shall reflect credit on the master. Needless to say, this is not sympathy but a very undesirable form of arrogance and selfishness masquerading as benevolence. True sympathy means<span class='page-number' id='s-548' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.548]</span> \"putting oneself in another's skin\", understanding and appreciating his view of things, his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span>, hopes and aspirations and feeling his struggles and sufferings as one's own. This is the true liberal sentiment, the true liberal enthusiasm which men like Mr. Hyndman feel but which is extremely rare in the so-called Liberal party. Mr. Morley never had this sentiment and enthusiasm, he had only a cold philosophic conviction of the truth of the Liberal view of politics. This conviction depended on a keen intellectual appreciation of the materialistic, agnostic, scientific enlightenment of modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> and the governing ideas of the nineteenth century. But the very keenness of this appreciation makes it utterly impossible for Mr. Morley and men like him to understand and sympathise with Asiatics. To them <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span> is a home of monstrous religions, barbarous despotisms, grotesque superstitions and a primitive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span>. That this half-civilised continent contains peoples as capable of self-government as any European race is a thing which they cannot persuade themselves to believe, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> notwithstanding. Japan has shown that Asiatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> is equal and in some important respects superior to European, needing only to be modernised and equipped with the mental and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> processes invented by European science. She has proved that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> Asiatics have shown in organising society and politics under old conditions can be diverted with admirable results to the reorganisation of society and politics under modern conditions. But to minds of the Morley type Japan only presents itself as a freak or an inexplicable exception. The world of Liberalism and enlightenment to which alone liberal philosophy is applicable and in which alone liberal institutions can flourish, is the world of Europe and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> which has inherited the legacy of Rome and Greece, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span> and rationalistic thought and science. Asia stands outside that charmed enclosure.\n\nThat this is the mental <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of Mr. John Morley is shown by the use which he has made of a certain passage from Mill: \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> by a dominant country is as legitimate as any other if it is one which in the existing state of the civilisation of the subject people most facilitates their transition to our state<span class='page-number' id='s-549' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.549]</span> of civilisation.\" Now, it is obvious that the case which Mill had in mind was that of a civilisation so inferior that the people possessing it had no capacity to raise themselves or to assimilate for themselves the essentials of a new organization and must be gradually trained up by foreigners; his dictum can have no reference to a great and living civilization like the civilizations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span>, Japan and India which have understood and practised organization and self-adaptation to surrounding circumstances for thousands of years and have developed a highly intellectual and ingenious people quick to understand, to imitate and to improve. Japan has reorganized herself without the blessings of foreign rule, China is doing the same, and there is no reason to suppose that there is any constitutional defect in the Indian people which would prevent them from following the example if the alien incubus were removed. In none of these cases would foreign rule facilitate the transition to a modern organization of politics and society; in India it has distinctly retarded it. But the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that Mr. Morley applies Mill's dictum to India shows his inability to appreciate Asiatic civilization, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and capacity. He cannot and will not believe that Asiatics can ever be on a level with Europeans or capable of equalling and surpassing them in their own arts and sciences. His view of them is the view of Rudyard <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kipling</span>; they are the white man's burden, the lower races, half devil and half <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>. This attitude of Mr. Morley's is the ingrained, unalterable European sentiment. The rise of Japan is to the European a thing monstrous, incredible, unrealisable; he makes friends with the monster because he has seen its strength, but in his secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> he chafes and rages against it as a thing intolerable and out of nature. He is prepared to use any and every means to crush Asiatic aspirations. Morality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> are meant to be employed in dealing with Asiatics just as much but no more than in dealing with the animal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>. There can be no European respect for Asiatics, no sympathy between them except the \"sympathy\" of the master for the slave, no peace except that which is won and maintained by the Asiatic sword. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East and West</span> is West and divided they shall remain; their temporary contact is decreed from time<span class='page-number' id='s-550' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.550]</span> to time so that each may take from the other's civilisation, but the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>interchange</span> does not bring them nearer to each other.

We wonder what Mr. Morley means by the State. The biographer of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burke</span> must certainly know enough of political science to be aware that a temporary and forcible subjugation of three hundred millions of people by a handful of alien bureaucrats does not constitute an organized state. It is an unnatural condition which can only last so long as the diseases of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> politic engendered by it do not become critical. The people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, thrilled with new ideas and aspirations, reawakened to self-knowledge and bent on ensuring the continuity in development of their ancient civilization, cannot see their way to assimilate themselves to the alien handful. They demand that the system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> shall be so rearranged that an organized State may again be constituted in India. The leaders in that attempt are the hope of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> State and a danger only to the morbid and unnatural bureaucratic cancer which prevents its growth. Lajpat Rai, says Mr. Morley, may have devoted his time and means to religious and social reforms, but he could not therefore expect immunity for the actions which render him a danger to the State. Now, Lajpat Rai devoted himself to politics in the very same spirit as he devoted himself to religious and social reform. His<span class='page-number' id='s-551' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.551]</span> whole aim was to assist the healthy and free development of this ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and its distinctive civilization. If he subordinated his social and religious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> for the time <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> to the political, it was from the conviction that the causes of his country's sufferings are political. If he erred, he has erred in company with Mr. Morley. It was the present hope of Anglo-India who tried to refute Professor Seeley and show that the striking amount of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> began to enjoy after her secession from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span> was the consequence of that secession. Independence, Mr. Morley argued, not only put the Americans on their mettle, but it left them with fresh views, with a temper of unbounded adaptability, with an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> readiness to try experiments and free room to indulge it as largely as ever they pleased.

Their \"freedoms\" are the concrete expressions, the sacred symbols of the popular will that has realised its sovereignty, and constitute the inviolable limitations under which the executive must work. They stand inaccessibly superior to the needs or wishes of those who actually carry on the government of the country, whose tenure of power primarily rests on their unquestioned submission to the sovereign will and freedom of the people as whose servants they administer.

A right can only be where the people are free, and signifies some inalienable incident of citizenship, the recognition of which is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> obligation on the Government. The things that masquerade in a country like India under the name of rights, are only concessions of might qualified by prudence and what is conceded in the prudential exercise of despotic power will be withdrawn out of the same consideration, the people remaining equally helpless before and after. The proclamation that is now brooding in a death-like hush over the Punjab and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> is the amplest confirmation of the foregoing lines and disposes finally of the sickening cant of John Morley about the coexistence of free speech and personal rule. The freedom of a subject race is only the freedom to starve and die, all the rest of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> on sufferance from those who govern.\n\nThe pseudosophies of the Radical philosopher who now rules our destinies, bear however some ugly results. They give in the first place a splendid opportunity to unblushing journals like the *Times* for insolent dissertations on the enlightened and democratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the Government that England has founded in the Orient and for illusory comparisons between the Indian Government and any other Government that might have possibly been established in this country if England had not come to bless her with her beneficent rule, the result of which is to place India in an entirely false light before the civilised world. They also fill the Briton, endowed by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> with more than the ordinary mortal's share of pride, with an intoxicating sense of exultation as he thinks of the noble work his countrymen are carrying on in India. But far worse than all this is the poison they instil into the minds of those immoderate lovers of England in general, and John Morley in particular, who are known as Moderates amongst us, hereby constantly<span class='page-number' id='s-554' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.554]</span> borrowing from the language of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> constitutionalism in order to designate the gewgaws given them by the Government. They have gradually deluded themselves into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> that Indians possess like Englishmen the real incidents of citizenship and such belief hardens into a dogma when Mr. Morley lends it his sanction.

No <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> that the whole world laughs at him in utter contempt and calls him a fool. There are two things that his English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and his reading of Morley have not given himâ€”the sense of history and the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span>. And when a proclamation descends like thunder and shatters all his pretentious nonsense to slivers, he clings nevertheless to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> and blames the Extremist for having brought on the catastrophe by his foolhardiness. He weeps and wails because he has lost his primary right of citizenship, without a moment's thought on the fact that he has neither rights nor citizenship, and that such things cannot be taken away by a Government. He has read in the history of free countries, but read in vain, that right and citizenship have behind them a sacred tradition of sacrifice, even to the shedding of blood, on a loyal adequate recognition of which their Government is founded. The Moderate does not see that what has been withdrawn from him by the proclamation is no such right as he pretends to have had, but the mere opportunity conceded by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> to the helot to pour forth his unavailing complaint.

Unless he relearns History and undeceives himself, he will always remain unfit for freedom, a hindrance to his country, a mere dupe of Morleyism, the subject of utter scorn for the nations that are free.

We need not trouble about the choleric effusions with a daily output of which Anglo-Indian writers nowadays provide their readers. But apart from the natural unhinging of the reason for which the prospect of loss of power and prestige or of trade is responsible, there is a plentiful lack of appreciation of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, its causes and probable effects not only on the part of the ruling class but of the majority of our educated people. We can understand the ruling class doing their very best to crush the movement out of self-interest. But it is none the less our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to return <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> and try our best to enlighten their intellectual haziness. It is from the want of a true perception of the nature of the movement that much of the misunderstanding and irritation has proceeded. And in trying to present it in its true bearing we have not been guided by any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> notions of our own but the decisions and findings of master-minds on the success of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> spiritual movements. Why do men at all turn their backs on old ideas and betake themselves to revolutionary ones?

The evil elements in them, if any, work themselves out in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> mischief. The true elements in them save a country by firing men with social hope and patriotic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, and the good done is well worth having even at the price of much harm and ruin. M. Taine gives the same explanation of the success of Rousseau and Voltaire in influencing the minds of the French people, though there were Montesquieu with a sort of historic method, Turgot and the school of the economists and, what is more, seventy thousand of the secular clergy and sixty thousand of the regular clergy, ever proclaiming by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> or exhortation ideas of peace, submission and a kingdom not of this world.\n\nAt certain critical moments in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> men come out from the narrow and confined track of their daily life and comprehend in one wide vision the whole situation; the august face of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> is suddenly unveiled to their eyes: in the sublimity of their emotion they seem to have a foretaste of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and at least discern some of its features. Naturally these features are precisely those which their age and their race happen to be in a condition to understand. The point of view put forward is the only one under which the multitude can place themselves. There is pronounced the unique word, heroic or tender, enthusiastic or tranquillising: the only word that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span> of the time would <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to hearken to; the only one adapted to the deep-growing wants, the long-gathered aspirations, the hereditary faculties.\n\nIt might seem strange if it were not so consonant with past examples, that a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> like Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span> who has so heartily admired the discernment of Taine about the secret of the great movements of human history and explained and elaborated it as clearly as possible, should look upon the present happenings in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> as mere effervescence due to accidental causes that will instantaneously subside at the mere frown of a mortal man however powerful.

Otherwise he would have perhaps understood that the same laws govern and explain all human movements whether among Europeans or Asiatics.

The movement in India, like all other movements in history, has life and vitality in it and its root deep in the very nature of things and events. It is not artificially got up, no movement of the kind can be; it has not been engineered by a Lajpat Rai or an Ajit Singh: it does not proceed from mere discontent or \"disloyalty\": it is no aberration or monstrosity. It has the uniformity, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identity</span> of manifestations in widely-separated regions, the similarity of thought, motive and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> which belong to great, sudden, spontaneous movements, to divine events.\n\nIndia was a centre of human prosperity and a fountain of light when there was still darkness and savagery on the face of the major portion of the earth and she has not gone into an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> eclipse.

The wine-trade in the south of France is on the decline because the French people are taking to other and cheaper beverages, and the vine-growers demand State protection and encouragement for their industry, which the French Government has not denied but has been somewhat dilatory in arranging.

This is all that from this distance <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> can understand. The interest of the outbreak for us lies in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that it began with a huge passive resistance <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> very much on the lines we have advocated in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, the object being to paralyze the Government and the chief weapon the voluntary resignation of the Municipalities which are indispensable instruments of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> in France. Unfortunately a fair <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> was not given to the experiment which should have been one of the most interesting in human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. With the arrival of the Military the movement passed into a queer amalgam of passive resistance, military mutiny and popular revolt; the leaders took fright, surrendered or bolted to Paris, wept at the feet of ministers and returned to advise their followers to weep and surrender along with them. The whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> is somewhat farcical and extremely French.

Perhaps passive resistance is in itself too much not only for French nature but for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span> generally; perhaps it is always bound to pass into active resistance. But this cannot be decided until it is given a fair trial by a more politic, patient and enduring race than the Frenchmen of the south.

The discovery that superior culture has not destroyed the primitive savage in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span>, has been welcomed with fierce gratification. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> paper writes:â€”\"It was a healthy sign to which the attention of native sedition-mongers may be usefully directed that the House of Commons which gave an appreciative reception to the speech of the Secretary of State showed impatience at the captious and mischievous vapourings of Mr. C. J. O'Donnell.\" Well, but why draw attention to it? We have been arguing the same thing from the very beginning of our propaganda. We were among the first to point out to a too credulous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> that the friends of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> in Parliament represented nobody but themselves. It was one of the principal items on the destructive side of the Nationalist programme, to prove the delusiveness of the prevalent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in the ultimate sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> of the British people. If the House of Commons saves us the trouble of farther argument and itself conclusively proves the soundness of our reasoning, we accept its assistance with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gratitude</span> but without surprise. We may draw the attention of our monitor in return to an equally healthy sign in India. Nobody now, at least in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, ventures in public to advocate an appeal to the bureaucracy or to the people in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> for the redress of our grievances. There may not be agreement as to the best means of gathering strength by self-help but the hope of gaining rights and privileges by what is known as constitutional agitation has been given up by one and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>. It is a faded superstition which has no longer any hold on<span class='page-number' id='s-566' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.566]</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span></span>. To warn us that the highly illiberal speech of Mr. Morley struck a responsive chord in every bosom in the House, is therefore <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> wasted. As nobody now looks with wistful eyes to that quarter, it is immaterial what they think or do. They may go into ecstasies over the speech of Morley, or they may gnash their teeth at the vapourings of O'Donnell; we in India are no longer affected by their frown or by their smile. The sympathy of people <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the seas is no longer our guiding star and what happens at Westminster is no concern of ours. We have to improvise our own means of meeting the Regulation *lathi* and other bureaucratic means of repression and we neither hope for nor desire its mitigation.\n\nIf it were possible for anyone to re-evoke that dead phantom of a phantom, British sympathy, we should not be grateful to him for constraining our unbound spirit into bonds again. The legend of British sympathy misled us for a century and now that the phantasm has of itself ceased to haunt us, let no one try to juggle and deceive us again with the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mantras</span>* of that modern black <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span>. Both Mr. Morley's speech and its effect on the British people are, we repeat, matters of supreme indifference to us, and the British and Anglo-Indian journals who want to frighten us into our old mendicant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> by trumpeting the \"sensible and resolute speech\" of Mr. Morley and the appreciation it received in the House, merely show that they have no true conception of the Nationalist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. The mind of our people has at last attained a certain amount of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>. Faith in unrealities no longer clogs its progress. The Budget speech admirably exposed the true relation between England and India and betrayed the hollowness of the so-called liberal professions which have so long exerted their poisonous influence on the unsophisticated Indian mind, displaced as it was from its own orbit by an unnational <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. Mr. Morley's outspokenness was welcome to the House? Well, it was tenfold more welcome to his \"enemies\" in India. Mr. Lalmohan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> in one of his more recent speeches, has said: \"Dazzled by the meretricious glitter of a tawdry <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imperialism</span>, conspicuous members of Parliament are now trying to sponge from their slate the teachings of men<span class='page-number' id='s-567' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.567]</span> like Gladstone and Bright.\" It was reserved for Mr. Morley to tell all India what some of us had perceived long ago, that those teachings were never meant to be carried out in practice.\n\nWhoever is a scourge of India must naturally be a demigod to the British people. The political instinct of a free people long accustomed to the international struggle for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, shrewd, commercial, practical, is not likely to be misled by humanitarian generalities as the politically inexperienced middle class in India have been misled; they have always felt that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who trod down India under a mailed heel and crushed Indian manhood and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> was serving their own interests.\n\nThe sequel to the trial of Warren Hastings is an excellent example of this dominant instinct. Twenty-seven years after the impeachment, sixteen years after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burke</span> had left his orations as a classic to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span></span>,â€”a scene was enacted in the House of Commons similar in spirit to the unanimous acclamation of Mr. Morley's speech. Warren Hastingsâ€”an old man of eightyâ€”appeared at the bar to give evidence in connection with the renewal of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> India charter. He was received with acclamations, a chair was ordered for him, and when he retired the members rose and uncovered. The political instinct of the people perceived that this man, ruthless and monstrous tyrant though he had been, had consolidated for them a political empire and a basis of commercial supremacy, and the means by which this great work had been accomplished, were sanctified by the result. The scourge of India, a recital of whose misdeeds had 27 years before made some of Burke's listeners swoon with horror, was honoured as a hero and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>god</span>, and biographies and histories have been written by the score to justify his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and exalt him to the skies. When therefore Mr. Morley declared his intention of preserving the Empire Hastings had consolidated, by any means however unjust or tyrannical, is it any wonder that an English House of Commons should recognise in him a worthy successor of Hastings and accord to him an unanimous applause?<span class='page-number' id='s-568' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.568]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-acclamation-of-the-house","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Perishing Prestige","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/perishing-prestige","prvt":"Stand Fast","prvu":"/cwsa/07/stand-fast","dt":"1907-07-02","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["perishing-prestige"],"t":"Perishing Prestige","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Some time back a retired Anglo-Indian wrote a letter on the unrest in the Punjab in the *Times*.

Rasul sitting side by side with Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde would form a leaven which, however small, might easily season the mass of the Committee and would at any rate prevent it from being a mere phonograph to repeat the decisions of the Dictator of Bombay. Recently there has been much talk of a meeting of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> Committee. Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> took an active interest in the idea and a sitting was actually arranged for June 30 to consider the crisis in India. There was nothing to object to in that; it seemed right and reasonable that the Committee should at least appear to justify its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. But then comes in the peculiar feature of this Committee which turns it from a straightforward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, of politicians elected by the people and observing the ordinary rules of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span>, into a Tibetan mystery. Certain gentlemen in Calcutta of more or less moderate views and irreproachable political respectability received notice of the meeting but other less favoured members of the Committee *were utterly unaware that the meeting was to be held at all*. A few days before the date fixed they were astonished to receive private letters from Bombay side assuming that they knew of it and would not fail to be present on the occasion. Neither Mr. Rasul nor Moti Babu nor Bipin Babu had received any notice from the proper quarters. Since then the meeting has been postponed and for the present all's well that ends well. But we should like to ask <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> or two questions. Is it possible that the conveners in Bombay did not know the addresses of the Nationalist members?â€”did not know for instance, that Mr. Rasul was a Barrister-at-law, or Sj. Motilal Ghose edited a not altogether unknown journal called the *Amrita Bazar Patrika* or Srijut Bipin Chandra was<span class='page-number' id='s-570' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.570]</span> connected with a weekly called *New India* of which also even Bombay worthies must at least have heard. Or was it merely an amiable bit of \"diplomatic tactics\" such as it has been our privilege to witness on occasions? We heard that Mr. Gokhale had given up the idea because he could not get the Bengal leaders to agreeâ€”though we are not aware that he made any very strenuous efforts to bring about an agreement. Is it possible that it was only intended to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> those of them this time who *could* agree? On the whole we are inclined to be charitable; no doubt the conveners thought that the Nationalist members would be likely to acquaint each other and the Committee might economise the public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> in stamps; or else they may have published the date of meeting in some Bombay paper and left it to these gentlemen to take noteâ€”if they had the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> luck to read it; or perhaps they knew all along that the sitting would not come off and did not like to trouble them. In any case we hope that this time they will be more formal and less kind. The members in question are none of them millionaires and cannot afford, on the strength of a newspaper notice, to take a trip to Bombayâ€”and find the meeting postponed.<span class='page-number' id='s-571' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.571]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/a-congress-committee-mystery","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Europe and Asia","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/europe-and-asia","prvt":"Perishing Prestige","prvu":"/cwsa/07/perishing-prestige","dt":"1907-07-02","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["europe-and-asia"],"t":"Europe and Asia","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The London correspondent of a contemporary quotes, with the apposite change of a word, some verses from a poem by Wilfrid Blunt which so admirably express the basic motive of the Nationalist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> that we reproduce it here.

The East is more ancient by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> thousands of years than the West, but a greater length of years does not necessarily imply a more advanced age. The years which would mean only childhood to a long-lived species would bring old age and death to more ephemeral stocks. Asia is long-lived, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> brief and ephemeral. Asia is in everything hugely-mapped, immense and grandiose in its motions, and its life-periods are measured accordingly. Europe lives by centuries, Asia by millenniums. Europe is parcelled out in nations, Asia in civilisations. The whole of Europe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> with a common, derived and largely second-hand culture; Asia supports three civilisations, each of them original and of the soil. Everything in Europe is small, rapid and short-lived; she has not the secret of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. Greece, the chief source of her civilisation, matured in two or three centuries, flourished for another two, and two more were sufficient for her decline and death. How few in years are the modern European nations, yet Spain is already dead, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Austria</span> death-stricken and suffering from gangrene and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> overtaken by a mortal and incurable malady, England already affected by the initial processes of decay. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> alone show any signs of a healthy and developing manhood. In the place which is left vacant by the decline of the European nations Asia young, strong and vigorous, dowered with the gift of immortality and the secret of self-transmutation, is preparing to step forward and possess the future. She alone can teach the world the secret of immortality which she possesses and in order that she may do so, she must reign.\n\nAsia has been described by the Europeans as decrepit; they will find to their amazement and dismay that she is rather emerging into her age of robust and perfect manhood. It is true that she reached ages ago heights of science, philosophy, civilisation which Europe is now toilfully trying to reach and that afterwards there was a slackening down, loss and disturbance from which she is only now recovering, but there was no decay or<span class='page-number' id='s-574' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.574]</span> decline. It was rather the disturbance, the temporary arrest, disorganization and derangement which marks the transition from boyhood to manhood. Her mighty civilizations, her great philosophies, her acute scientific observations and intuitions were the toys and games of her yet immature and imperfect powers, the light and easy play of a child-giant, and form merely a slight index of the far greater things she will accomplish in the coming days of her ripe strength and maturity. What she did, she did by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> of intuition and imagination, the first free penetrating sympathy of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> fresh from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> source of life.

The fundamental difference between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East and West</span> has been exemplified more than once in recent times. What European nation could have changed its whole political, social and economic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> in a few years like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span>, with so little trouble, with such thoroughness and science, with the minimum of disturbance to its national economy? The phenomenon is so alien to European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> and European experience that even to this day Western observers have been unable to understand it. Japan is a \"weird\" nation, that is all the conclusion they can come to on the subject. What European nation again would deal so swiftly, directly and earnestly with its own national vices as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chinese</span> are dealing with the opium vice in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span>? The very idea that China really meant it, was incredible to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> observers. And well it might be, for one can imagine what would be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of any such attempt to deal with the national vice of drunkenness in England.

Such a rule can surely not be so loosely rooted that the \"vapouring\" of agitators can blow it out of the soil or the helplessness of an unarmed people endanger its security.\n\nThe natural and legitimate method by which a modern government meets sedition, is to present the strong defence of an impeccable administration to its attacks. If there are weak points, they must be so few or of such minor importance that even to the most ignorant eye or the most ill-informed understanding they will appear insignificant compared with the benevolent policy and beneficent working in the large, of the system assailed. If there is misrepresentation, the administration has its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> or its own supporters who can meet the assailants with their own weapons in the Press and on the platform.

Writing and speech are not the monopoly of agitators.

And by such persistent mendicancy alone he aspires to win his country's libertyâ€”liberty to which Europe has wilfully waded her way through a welter of blood after her struggles of centuries. No, cries the irritated European, India can never be fit to govern herself. This is the secret of John Morley's point-blank refusal to satisfy Moderate aspirations; he has thrown to them a plaything or two, for they deserve nothing better. And because Mr. Morley loves and prizes liberty more highly than the average man, therefore has he been the more intolerant of the Moderate's pretensions, the more merciless in felling to the ground all his cherished delusions based on his inverted conception of liberty. The Partition of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> Mr. Morley admits to be a wrong, but he will not undo it because it is a settled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>; in other words, in dealing with dependent India he refuses to observe the rules of political morality which he has himself so clearly enunciated; in enunciating them, he would say, he had in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span> only the rights and obligations that arise between one free people and another, and not the relationship between a ruling race and their abjectly servile subjects. All his other pronouncements point to the same moral. And have we not heard of the common English labourer who on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> harangued eloquently by a Moderate missionary about Indian grievances asked him bluntly if he was really relating the true state of affairs, and on being answered in the affirmative told the missionary without much ceremony that a people who could submit to such wrongs and could think of nothing better than the sending of representatives to England to plead for their removal, fully deserved to be ruled by an arbitrary despotism? Unknowingly perhaps he was summarising the verdict of the civilised world on Indian politics. The moneymaking middle class in England say the same thing, and further<span class='page-number' id='s-586' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.586]</span> strengthen their argument with the interesting inquiry, \"What is to become of our boys if we leave the management of India in your hands?\" The man from the Continent or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> asks plainly, \"How can the whole three hundred million of you be kept under by 70,000 tommies?\"\n\nOught not all this to give our Moderate friends furiously to think? We can appreciate the humanity of their desire to emancipate the country without dragging her through the red horror of a revolution. But let them reconsider how best to achieve this end. Surely their failure to obtain anything worth having after thirty years of patient supplication culminating in the supreme tragedy of the refusal of John Morley, the one man of whom they had expected more than of any otherâ€”even to listen to their prayers with any seriousness, ought to impel them to some introspective inquiry regarding the soundness of their political faith. We also invite their thoughts to the changing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of England and of the whole world towards India since the declaration of the Boycott and the rise of the new party.

And a \"defective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>\" alone is not responsible for the shyness of Indian capital. However, we too admit that the system of education, stamped with official approval, is responsible for much of our woe as it engenders a spirit of helpless dependence and sense of inferiority and discourages in Indians the confidence in one's own ability which is essential to enterprise. It is exactly for this reason that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> has realised the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span> which will have the same effects in India that such a system had in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span>.

The Magistrate prohibits the holding of the District Conference at Khulna. The High Court is moved and the illegal ukase is precipitately withdrawn: but the withdrawal was merely a change of tactics. A bureaucracy never lacks pretexts to harass the undesirables. The promoters of the Conference are now on their trial for making seditious speeches in the Conference.\n\nAt Faridpur a local leader whose faith in the ultimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> sense of the autocratic rulers has outlived even the recent violent strain, arranged for a District Conference on a grand scale<span class='page-number' id='s-589' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.589]</span> notwithstanding the protests of a section of the public against holding meetings with permission from the Police. As the recent District Conferences, though compromising our self-respect to a certain extent, have at last been justified by their results, we have preferred not to press the point of honour. We have submitted to the Ordinance by not holding meetings; Faridpur and Pabna carry their weakness a little further, that is all. And on the whole it was well that the attempt to hold the Conference was made. For the Faridpur leaders adopted to a certain extent the Nationalist programme and have, as a consequence, come in conflict with the bureaucracy. The prohibitory ukase of the Magistrate of Faridpur leaves no doubt as to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the bureaucracy towards opposition in any form. They demand a tame acquiescence in their arbitrary regulations and are determined to put down any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of adverse opinion under the pretext of preventing the spread of disaffection and the disturbance of public tranquillity. Is further explicitness wanted? Cultivate the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of \"wooing\", hold meetings to issue loyalist manifestos or celebrate the Empire Day, but if you are audacious enough to express your discontent, the British truncheon is ready for you. This is the whole meaning of these ukases; this is the moral repeatedly inculcated through the various prohibitory circulars. As the old superstitions have still their hold on some minds, we welcome the repetition of such browbeating. But in the meantime we must not fail to turn them to account. If we are not capable of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> any active opposition to the encroachment on our natural rights, the intensified sense of wrong should at least give a healthy direction to the patriotic efforts of all.

Apparently it was all Mr. Naoroji's fault that no more Indian members are elected. He would keep harping on Indian grievances, a thing no British constituency could be expected to stand. The *Pioneer* then points out that the Congress has been particularly unfortunate in attracting eccentrics and faddists to its side, while it has repelled great and rising statesmen like Mr. Rees. Omitting the *Pioneer*'s little joke about Mr. Rees who would be more in place in a broad farce or musical comedy at the Gaiety than in the House, there is truth in the *Pioneer*'s remarks.

But unfortunately, this which would be the whole matter in a free country, is a very small part of it in India. What is it that Anglo-India is fighting for? What is it that we shall be helping to establish if we support her? It is not the independence of the Press, it is not the common rights of the citizen. Anglo-India is a determined enemy of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of the Indian Press, she is always howling for the repression of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>free speech</span> in matters political and for savage punishments to be meted out to Indian speakers and journalists; and even in non-political matters, if it were only Indian journals that were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> prosecuted, she would not care a button or stir a finger to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> them. Anglo-India is equally a determined opponent of the rights of citizens being extended to Indians, a consistent supporter of despotic and personal rule. And she is so because she has felt confident that the Press repression and administrative coercion she advocated would not be applied against her, rather she would herself be the power behind the throne. This confidence has received a rude and startling shock. Hence her rage and outcry, hence this howling of wolves for the blood of Sir Andrew Fraser. What Anglo-India is fighting for is the independence of the Anglo-Indian Press, and that only as part of the Anglo-Indian supremacy. She is fighting for her exemption from the laws and the administrative severity which she <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> to see savagely applied to us. She is fighting against her being put on the same level as her Indian fellow-subjects. Is this an object in which we can support her? She wishes us to support her in vindicating her independence and supremacy which she will use in binding the chains tighter on ourselves. Are we going to be such idiots as to help her in her game?<span class='page-number' id='s-602' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.602]</span>\n\nThe spirit in which Anglo-India is fighting has hardly been concealed. The *Daily News* has frankly said that despotism is necessary as against the people of India, but that it is limited as against men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> by the ultimate supremacy of the English people of whom, it is hinted, the Anglo-Indians are a part. The question is not so easy as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> that. The supreme power, the sovereignty, maker of the laws and above the laws, in India is the conjoint power of the British Parliament and the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy, the latter receiving its authority from the former, but in practice exercising the whole sovereignty. Every sovereign, however, rests his sovereignty on some support in the country or outside it, and our sovereign the bureaucracy rests on the support, for extraordinary occasions, of the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and for ordinary purposes on that of the Indian police and army and the Anglo-Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>. If the Indian police and military revolt or are unable to maintain the sovereign, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> crisis supervenes and the British army has to be called in to restore the balance. But ordinarily the Indian police and military and especially the former are of supreme importance, much more so than the unofficial Anglo-Indians who can only give a valuable but not indispensable moral support. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> therefore to secure and make the most of its chief support, the sovereign bureaucracy must itself support the police even against Anglo-India. But Anglo-India is not satisfied with this position; she puts a high value on her support and desires to share the sovereignty informally, through the Press and the Chambers of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Commerce</span>. This is a natural desire, but why should we help her to attain it?

Neither the people nor the bureaucracy really accept a conviction as proof of any offence against the law. Indeed it is more or less a matter of caprice or convenience whether <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> offence or another is selected. When the crime is not chosen with a view to the punishment it is desired to inflict, or the greater ease of securing evidence, or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of convicting when there is no evidence, the problem is probably determined by the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span> of the prosecuting Magistrate or by an aesthetic perception of the fitness of things. Generally the Swadeshi worker is charged with sedition or assault or breach of the peace or wishing to break the peace or thinking of doing something which somebody in authority pretends to believe likely to break the peace but he might just as well be charged with burglary or abduction or with contempt of the Magistrate's *khansamah* or with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> stare or the Coconada grimace. The main object is to send him to prison or bind him over not to do any work for Swadeshi for six months or a year, and the pretext is a mere bagatelle. The real point is not whether the accused is innocent or guilty of the particular offence but whether he is innocent or guilty of Swadeshi, whether he is innocent or guilty of patriotism, whether he is innocent or guilty of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>. For this reason no disgrace attaches to conviction,<span class='page-number' id='s-604' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.604]</span> rather it is the passport to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span>, honour and public esteem. The prosecution is a farce, the defence is a farce, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>judgment</span> is the most exquisite farce of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>. The bureaucracy go through the farce because they cling to the shadow of moral prestige even when the substance of it is gone: they like to adopt Russian methods, but they do not like them to be called Russian and still hug the delusion that by going through the legal forms of which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Justice</span> makes use they can cover the nakedness of their tyranny with the rags of law. The accused go through the farce with the sole object of so managing the defence as to dispel even the last shadow of the old moral prestige and to expose the nakedness of bureaucratic oppression more and more. It is a political fight with the law-courts for its scene.\n\nIn no recent political case except Rawalpindi has the veil of law been so ridiculously thin as in the Khulna case. Partly, no doubt, this is due to the personal gifts of the prosecuting Magistrate who decided the case. Mr. Asanuddin Ahmed is a very distinguished <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>. The greatest and most successful achievement of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> was to be a fellow-collegian of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span>. But he has other sufficiently respectable if less gorgeous claims to distinction. Arithmetic, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> and Law are his chief fortes. His mastery over figures is so great that arithmetic is his slave and not his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>; it is even said that he can assess a man at Rs. 90 one day and bring him down 200 per cent in estimation the other. It is whispered that it was not only for a masterly general incompetence but also for this special gift that he was transferred to Khulna. His triumphant dealings with logic were admirably exampled by the original syllogism which he presented to the startled organisers of the District Conference. \"I, Asanuddin, am the District Magistrate; the District Magistrate is the representative of the district; ergo, I, Asanuddin, am the one and only representative of the district. Now only a representative of the district has a right to hold a District Conference or to do anything in the name of the district, or to use any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> in which the word district occurs; I, Asanuddin, am the sole and only representative of the district; ergo, I, Asanuddin, have the sole and only right to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a District Conference.\" Mr. Ahmed's<span class='page-number' id='s-605' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.605]</span> English is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of the judges of the High Court, who are believed to spend sleepless nights in trying to make out the meaning of his judgments. In one case at least, it is said, a distinguished judge had to confess with sorrow and humiliation that he could make nothing of the English of the learned Magistrate and after reading the judgment in the present case we can well believe the story. As for his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of law, the best praise we can give it is that it is on a level with his knowledge of, say, English. Such was the brilliant creature who appointed himself prosecutor, jury and judge in the Khulna sedition case.\n\nUnder such auspices the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the case was sure to be distinguished by a peculiarly effulgent brilliancy. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to prove that Venibhushan Rai talked sedition it was thought necessary to prove how <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> volunteers were present at the Conference. This is a fair example of the kind of evidence on which the case was decided and which the great Asanuddin declared to be particularly relevant. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Beyond</span> evidence of this stamp there was no proof against the accused except the evidence of police officers unsupported by any verbatim report, while on the other side were the statements of the respectable pleaders, the verbatim copy of the speech and a whole mass of unshaken testimony. But our one and only Asanuddin declared that the evidence of respectable men was not to be believed because they *were* respectable and graduates of the Calcutta University and partakers in the Conference; the police apparently were the only disinterested and truthful people in Khulna. But the most remarkable dictum of this remarkable man was that when one is charged with sedition it is not necessary to prove the use of any particular seditious utterances; it is quite enough for the Magistrate to come to the conclusion that something untoward might, could or should have happened as the result of the accused having made a speech. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, it is hardly necessary under the section as interpreted by Daniels of this kind, to prove anything against the accused; the only thing necessary is that the Magistrate should think it better for convenience official or unofficial that he should be bound over. The section answers the same purpose in minor cases which the regulation of 1818<span class='page-number' id='s-606' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.606]</span> answers in the case of more powerful opponents of irresponsible despotism.\n\nThe Khulna case has been from the point of view of Justice an undress rehearsal of the usual bureaucratic comedy; from the point of view of Mr. Asanuddin Ahmed it has been a brilliant exhibition of his superhuman power of acting folly and talking nonsense; from the point of view of Srijut Venibhushan Rai it has been a triumph greater than any legal victory, a public certificate of patriotism, courage and sincerity, an accolade of knighthood and nobility in the service of the motherland.<span class='page-number' id='s-607' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.607]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-khulna-comedy","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"A Noble Example","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-noble-example","prvt":"A Plague o' Both Your Houses","prvu":"/cwsa/07/a-plague-o-both-your-houses","dt":"1907-07-20","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-noble-example"],"t":"A Noble Example","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The proprietors of the Ahmedabad Fine Mills have been doing substantial work not only for the industrial progress of the country but for Indian unity.

He is the first who standing in the dock, called to account by the alien under alien-made law for preaching the gospel of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> to his countrymen, has refused to acknowledge any responsibility to the alien bureaucracy. It is extremely important that the real meaning of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the accused should not be mistaken, for it has undoubtedly been obscured by the shape into which it was put under the influence of others more accustomed to legal notions and legal phraseology than to the plain utterance of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>. The accused was strongly represented, Srijuts Ashutosh <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaudhuri</span>, Aswini <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Banerji</span>, Chittaranjan <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Das</span> and A.

We think, however, it might have been better if Srijut Bhupendranath had rejected even this brilliant legal assistance and relied on the frank and straightforward utterance which wells up from the depths of a strong and abiding feeling and profound intellectual conviction. The over-careful language of legality, guiding its feet with delicate scrupulousness among a million traps and pitfalls and intent only upon avoiding a stumble, that is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> thing; the clear bold speech of the patriot speaking straight to his countrymen's hearts, enamoured of martyrdom, exalted with<span class='page-number' id='s-612' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.612]</span> the passionate realisation of sacred liberty, that is quite another. Bhupendranath's statement was a political declaration, not a legal formula, and it should so have been expressed. Unfortunately it was toned down into legal form and lost half its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. In the original statement drawn up under the instructions of the accused he had declared sans phrase, \"I have done what I considered my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to my country\" and ended by saying, \"I do not wish to make any farther statement or *to take any part in the case*.\" This was clear enough; the editor of *Yugantar*, consistent with the views he had publicly professed, refused to do anything which would seem to be an acknowledgement of responsibility to the codified caprice or selfishness of the small handful of alien officials who <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> themselves the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> established by law. He had written with his eye not on the limitations imposed by the Penal Code, but on the needs of his country. This responsibility was to his countrymen, not to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> officials. To plead before a Court constituted by the bureaucracy, was to admit his responsibility to aliens and deny his responsibility to his countrymen.\n\nUnfortunately the edge of the utterance was blunted by the verbal alterations made by the pleader, who looked on the statement with the eyes of the lawyer, not of the politician. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and dignified appeal to the duty his country demanded of him was marred by the legal plea of good <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>; the patriot's refusal to take part in a trial before the very authority it was his whole mission to displace, was modified into a legal abstention from any further \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>\" in an ordinary undefended trial. Later in the day a worse thing happened. Srijut Ashutosh Chaudhuri has been severely criticised for the remarks with which he accompanied his refusal to give any address. It is fair to state that he does not seem to have been accurately reported. We are informed that he prefaced his remarks by saying that as his client had refused to plead, he had no *locus standi* in the case; whatever he said, was therefore not spoken in the name of Srijut Bhupendranath, but merely expressed his own opinion. We are also informed that he did not say that the accused had placed himself in the Magistrate's hands, but simply that the case was now in the<span class='page-number' id='s-613' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.613]</span> Magistrate's hands and Counsel had no farther concern in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>. Nevertheless, Mr. Chaudhuri's intervention was unfortunate, as it has led to the obscuring of the true spirit of the statement, so much so that Srijut Bhupendranath was considering whether he should not make an additional statement in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to make clear his position but was advised that the opportunity had passed. The proposed statement was to the following effect, \"I do not wish any address to be delivered by Counsel on my behalf. I have refused to plead not because I wish to withdraw a single word of what I have written or acknowledge the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> of any sentence that may be passed on me, but for an opposite reason. I have written what everyone knows to be true and what is in the minds of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> my countrymen, but I was aware that in doing so I would have no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of justice in the British Courts. I do not think it consistent with the views I have always preached to plead before them.\"\n\nThe justice of which there was no chance, was of course, not justice according to the letter of the alien law, but moral justice. When Mr. Aswini Banerji declared that the accused neither pleaded guilty nor not guilty, but simply declared that he had done no wrong, the Magistrate asked whether he meant legal wrong or moral wrong and certain empty-headed people in the audience laughed. But it is no laughing matter to a rule which has no roots in the soil, when there comes to be a recognized opposition, recognized equally by rulers and ruled, between the laws it enforces and the obligations of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span>, when an action savagely punished by authority is recognized as morally inoffensive or praiseworthy. It means that the whole basis of the rule has become rotten, that it has neither a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> nor a moral foundation.\n\nSrijut Bhupendranath's attitude was dignified and consistent. His duty to his country, the interests of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, of her very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, demanded that he should preach the gospel of independence. But the duty to our country, the interests of our country can be no justification before the law of the alien. Rather the interests of the rulers being diametrically opposed to the interests of the ruled, those who try to promote the latter are<span class='page-number' id='s-614' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.614]</span> natural enemies of the former and punishable by the alien law. To hope for justice therefore in political cases where one of the parties is the judge, is irrational and to plead justification to those against whom one's action was directed, an inconsistency and a degradation. It was open to the accused to plead not in order to defend himself, but to make his position clear to the world at large. But not even to this would Bhupendranath condescend. He refused to do anything which could be construed into an acknowledgement of responsibility for his political actions to an established authority ruling and resolved to continue ruling without the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> of the Indian people.<span class='page-number' id='s-615' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.615]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/srijut-bhupendranath","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Issue","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-issue","prvt":"One More for the Altar","prvu":"/cwsa/07/one-more-for-the-altar","dt":"1907-07-26","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-issue"],"t":"The Issue","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The bureaucracy as usual has overreached itself in instituting a case under the sedition clause against the editor of the *Yugantar*.

The question is not whether one Bhupendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> published matter which he knew to be likely to bring the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> established by law, to wit certain mediocrities in Belvedere, Darjeeling, Shillong or Simla who collectively <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> themselves the Government of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> or of India, into contempt or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, or to encourage a desire to resist or subvert their lawful authority. If that were all, we might argue the question whether what he did was wise or what he wrote was true or mistaken, legal or illegal. As it is, these things do not matter even to the value of a broken cowrie. The real issue for us Nationalists is something quite different and infinitely more vital. It is this, \"Is India free?\"â€”not even \"Shall India be free?\" but, is India free and am I as an Indian free or a serf bound to the service, the behest or the forced <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> of something outside and alien to myself and mine, something which is anatman, not myself?

The princes of Bengal at the time of Plassey did not realise that we could save ourselves, they thought that something outside would save us. We were not enslaved by Clive, for not even a thousand Clives could have had strength enough to enslave us, we were enslaved by our own delusions, by the false conviction of weakness. And the moment we get the full conviction of our strength, the conviction that we are for ever and inalienably free, and that nobody but ourselves can either take or keep from us that inalienable and priceless possession, from that moment freedom is assured. So long as we go on crying, \"We are unfit, we are unfit\", or even doubt our fitness, so long we shall make and keep ourselves unfit. It is only the conviction of fitness for freedom and the practice of freedom that makes and keeps men fit for freedom.

The exaggerated praise which was showered by the Bhagalpur vendors of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> on officials who had little or nothing to do with the actual fight with the plague, is an example of the value of these addresses. It is of course impossible for the address-mongers not to have known the real facts, but truth is not a commodity which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> can profitably offer to the official dispensers of posts and titles. There are three kinds of composition which are exempted from the moral obligation of truthfulness, an epitaph, a loyalist address and an official statement. The description given of the work of the Ramakrishna Mission is admirable and touching, but such deeds we take as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of course and the least we can expect from those whose<span class='page-number' id='s-620' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.620]</span> lives have been shaped by Ramakrishna and Vivekananda; it would be surprising if those who have touched the hem of the garments of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> should not themselves have something in them of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span>. But the most significant part of the communication is the remarkable statement about the alarm of the police at the work of the Mission. That alarm is a pregnant comment on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the bureaucratic domination in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. We have more than once pointed out that an alien rule without roots in the soil cannot possibly tolerate the growth of any strength or manliness or nobility in the subject people, and must inevitably try to crush, curb or render ineffective any actual or possible centre of strength around which it is remotely possible for the national self-consciousness to crystallize. Hence the alarm and suspicion which a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> like the Ramakrishna Mission, utterly divorced from politics as it is, awakes in the rulers. \"Here are *men*, here are people who can feel work and dare for their suffering countrymen. If this manhood should prove catching? if it should even grow common and turn into channels directly dangerous to me? if these men should win a commanding influence by their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> works and use it against me?\" Such are the guilty suspicions which the bureaucrat is tortured with, and no movement however innocent can escape them. So he first bids his police spy out and give him full reports of these dangerous characters, dangerous because of their very nobility, and by police oppression, surveillance and harassment he will, when he thinks necessary, try to grind down, wear away and gradually efface the thing he fears. In the beginning of the *Yugantar* case one young <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who was questioned by the police wished to take upon himself the responsibility for the incriminating articles, but the inquiring officer told him, \"Whatever you may say, you will not save Bhupen <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span>; the mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that he is Swami Vivekananda's brother will be enough to send him to prison.\"<span class='page-number' id='s-621' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.621]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/bureaucratic-alarms","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The 7th of August","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-7th-of-august","prvt":"District Conference at Hughly","prvu":"/cwsa/07/district-conference-at-hughly","dt":"1907-07-30","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-7th-of-august"],"t":"The 7th of August","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The approaching celebration of the 7th of August has a double importance this year, for it has not only its general and permanent importance as the commemoration of our declaration of independence, but an occasional though none the less urgent importance as an opportunity of reaffirming our separate national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> against the arbitrary and futile attempt of the bureaucracy to reaffirm and perpetuate a vanishing despotism. The 7th of August will be recognised in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> as a far more important date to the building up of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> than the 16th October. On the 16th October the threatened unity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> was asserted against the disingenuous and dangerous attack engineered by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span>; and since it is on the solidarity of its regional and race units that the greater Pan-Indian unity can alone be firmly founded, the 16th October must always be a holy day in the Indian calendar. But on the 7th of August Bengal discovered for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> the idea of Indian independence as a living reality and not a distant Utopia, on the 7th of August she consecrated herself to the realisation of that supreme ideal by the declaration of the Boycott. The time has not come yet when the full meaning of that declaration can be understood; even the whole of Bengal has not yet understood, much less the whole of India. But the light is coming; partly by the efforts of the preachers of the light, still more by the efforts of the enemies of the light, it is coming: and in the dim wide glimmer of the mighty dawn we can see the vast slow surge of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> quickening under the breath of a stupendous wind, we can discern the angry fringes of the tide casting themselves far <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the old low level, we can almost hear the roar of the surf<span class='page-number' id='s-622' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.622]</span> hurling itself on the flimsy barriers it had once accepted as an iron and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> boundary. The waters are at last alive with the breath of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>, the flood which is to overwhelm the world has begun.\n\nThe 7th of August was India's Independence Day. A big word, it may be said, far too grandiose for the little that was accomplished. To those who judge only by the gross <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> event it may seem so, but to those who look beneath and watch the course of events as they shape themselves in the soul of a nation, the phrase will not seem <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> whit too excessive. It is the soul within us that decides, that makes our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>, that determines <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span>, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span></span>, material events only shape themselves under the limitations of Space and Time to give an outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and realisation to the decisions of the soul. The day of a nation's independence is not the day when the administrative changes are made which complete the outward realisation of its independence but the day when it realises in its soul that it is free and must be free. For it is the self-sufficing separateness of a nation that is its independence, and when that separateness is realised and recorded as a determined thing in ourselves, the outward realisation is only a question of time. The seventh of August was the birthday of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, and Indian Nationalism, as we pointed out the other day, means two things, the self-consecration to the gospel of national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and the practice of independence. Boycott is the practice of independence. When therefore we declared the Boycott on the seventh of August, it was no mere economical revolt we were instituting, but the practice of national independence; for the attempt to be separate and self-sufficient economically must bring with it the attempt to be free in every other function of a nation's life; for these functions are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> mutually interdependent. August 7th is therefore the day when Indian Nationalism was born, when India discovered to her soul her own freedom, when we set our feet irrevocably on the only path to unity, the only path to self-realisation. On that day the foundation-stone of the new Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> was laid.\n\nLet us then celebrate the day in a spirit and after a fashion<span class='page-number' id='s-623' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.623]</span> suitable to its great and glorious meaning. Let it be a reconsecration of the whole of Bengal to the new spirit and the new life, a purification of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> to make it the undivided possession and the consecrated temple and habitation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>. And secondly let it be a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span>, brave and masculine reaffirmation of our independent existence. The bureaucracy has flung itself with savage fury on the new activities of our national life; it has attempted to trample on and break to pieces under its armed heel our economical boycott; it has made the service of the motherland penal in her young men; it has visited with the prison and deportation the preaching of Nationalism by the elder men. The 7th of August must be an emphatic answer to these persecutions and prohibitions. The Boycott must be reaffirmed and this time in its purity and simplicity as the national policy to which all are committed. The Risley Circular must be definitely and unmistakably challenged and negatived in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. Let there be a procession of students led by those venerable leaders of Bengal who are also professors of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> University. And let us see afterwards what the bureaucracy can do and what it dare do to the men who refuse to give up their lifelong and sacred occupation at an alien bidding and to the youths who refuse to abstain from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>initiation</span> in the same sacred service out of sordid hopes and fears.\n\nBut most of all the day should be a day of rejoicing and a day of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span>. The whole Indian part of the town should be illumined in honour of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> which saw the light two years ago. And along with the outer illumination it should be a day of the illumination of hearts. It is the sacrament of our religion that can alone give the perfect and effective blessing to our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, and the celebration of this great day will not be complete until every Indian makes it a sacred observance, worshipping God in his own way, the Hindu in his temple, the Brahmo in his mandir, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> in his mosque, to consecrate himself anew on that day to the service of that single and omnipresent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Deity</span> through the task He has set to the whole nation, the upbuilding of Indian nationality by self-sacrifice for the motherland.<span class='page-number' id='s-624' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.624]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-7th-of-august","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Indian Patriot on Ourselves","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-indian-patriot-on-ourselves","prvt":"Bureaucratic Alarms","prvu":"/cwsa/07/bureaucratic-alarms","dt":"1907-08-06","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-indian-patriot-on-ourselves"],"t":"The Indian Patriot on Ourselves","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We gave in full yesterday the article of the *Indian Patriot* in which our contemporary criticised the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> in searching the *Bande Mataram* office as a preliminary, it is presumed, to a prosecution under the sedition clause.

Because <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> has refused to hear our prayers and melt at our tears, therefore we advocate an appeal to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>.

Those who are at present responsible for the policy of this paper were never believers in the old gospel of mendicancy and at no time in their lives were associated with Congress politics; they publicly opposed the Congress propaganda as futile and doomed to failure at a time when the country at large was full of a touching but ignorant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in prayers and resolutions and British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>.

These copybook maxims are, of course, meant for the especial benefit of the under-dog in the struggle.

No, it is only the down-trodden and suffering people of India who are expected to refrain from following the straight line of their national interest and welfare out of a noble and sensitive unwillingness to excite hatred and strife.\n\nWe have repeatedly said that Boycott is not a gospel of hatred. It is simply an assertion of our independence, our national separateness. But neither do we pretend that we can ask the rulers to overflow with feelings of benevolence for the Boycott or to regard it with kindly neutrality. Boycott has come among us not to bring peace but a sword. And this was inevitable. Until now the discontent, the ill-will, the suffering were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> on one side. When one side is depressed, miserable, suffering, while the other thrives and prospers by means of that misery and suffering, when one side is denied the use of its capacities and the satisfaction of its aspirations, and the other grows great and glorious and robust by the exercise of the usurped opportunities it has taken from its neighbour, there must be resentment, there must be antagonism and therefore strife and ill-will and anger. No amount of pious and ethical exhortation will prevent it. When a just equality is denied, when the possibility of equal opportunities and equal accomplishment is rigidly excluded, there can be no real love and good feeling except such as exists between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and some of the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span>. If there is insensibility on one side and indulgent masterfulness on the other, there can be an insulting patronage and a degrading <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span>, but these are animal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> rather than the higher ethical feelings. It is only where liberty and a just equality are established that true good feeling can reign. Those who deny liberty have no right to appeal to the higher feelings or to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span> at all, for they are trying to perpetuate for their own selfish ends an essentially immoral condition of things. So long as liberty is denied, there must be the hatred which the slave always cherishes for his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>, and when the attempt to throw off the yoke comes, there must be the yet bitterer hatred which the master feels for his revolted slave. The denial of liberty is therefore doubly and trebly immoral and<span class='page-number' id='s-627' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.627]</span> restoration of liberty the first condition of peace and good-will. There has been good feeling between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Austria</span> and a free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span>, but between Austria dominant and Italy enslaved it was impossible.\n\nThe English have long been boycotting us in our own country. They boycotted our industries out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, they boycotted our noblest capacities into atrophy by denying us any share in the higher activities of national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, they boycotted us in the management of our affairs, in the defence of our country, in the making of its laws. And India impoverished, degraded, demoralized, did not look with love upon the spoiler. Now the Boycott has commenced upon the other side, but it is not an act of retaliation merely; it is much more an unravelling of the English web, a retracing of the steps towards perdition which we were forced or induced to take. Shall we continue our course to perdition, shall we refuse to retrace our steps because it cannot be done without strife and ill-feeling, because it must temporarily result in a growth of enmity between class and class? Shall we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to lie for ever stifled in the fatal web because the unweaving of it must enrage the master of the web? No, the curse of alien domination must be worked out, the doom which compels it to create hatred in its making and hatred in its unmaking. When natural relations have been restored, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and India may stand side by side as equals, comrades and allies in the world's work, but until that is done, it is hypocrisy or folly to suppose that we can escape <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s law which makes strife the straight rough way to peace and enmity the father of union.

It was started on the 6th of August last year and its anniversary falls strictly on that date. But it is only in the fitness of things that the organ of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> should choose the birthday of Nationalism in the country for the purpose of observing its anniversary.

The *Bande Mataram* has been before the public for a year and it has, we believe, rendered a tolerably fair account of itself. It claims that it has given <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> to the will of the people and sketched their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> and aspirations with the greatest amount of fidelity. It is for this reason that it has received a splendid reception in almost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the provinces of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. The amount of support it has got in the first year of its existence surpasses all previous records in Indian journalism. The political ideal of the people has changed, the desire for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> to be reckoned with and if anybody has any doubt on the point, success of the *Bande Mataram* should set it at rest.

We think the veteran leader has gauged the situation very accurately, but we confess we do not see at present where the statesmanship is to come from which is to carry out the difficult, arduous and delicate task before us. What we have done hitherto we have done without leadership, almost without clear purpose, under an inspiring and impelling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> which we must necessarily think <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span>. Where that force has visibly guided us, we have done astonishing things: but at the same time there has been much confusion, one-sidedness and incoherence in our work. And now that a powerful and organised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> has set itself in grim earnest to destroy our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, it is imperative that we too should organise and make our whole potential strength effective for self-defence. The divine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> will only be continued to us if we show ourselves in our strength and wisdom worthy of it. But it cannot be denied that the first effect of the repression has been to disorganise our work. Since it began, there has been no concerted and coherent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> has done what seemed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> in his own eyes or else remained inactive. The result has been much weakness, supineness and ineffectiveness. Barisal fights for its own hand to maintain the boycott. The *Yugantar* attacked carries on a heroic struggle with the bureaucracy with what stray assistance, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> generosity or patriotism may offer it. But organised<span class='page-number' id='s-630' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.630]</span> resistance, organised persistence even there is none.\n\nThis unsatisfactory condition of things is traceable to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> main cause. All <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> is heartily agreed in Swadeshi and professedly all are agreed on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of industrial boycott. But a majority of the older leaders, trained in another school of politics, cannot adapt themselves to the new state of things, they cannot even throw themselves heartily into the only measures which can make the industrial boycott crushingly effective, and they are out of sympathy with the wider developments of boycott which are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> indispensable if we are to meet the bureaucratic attack with full success. They object personally to the new men and decline to work in co-operation with them. The new men, on the other hand, who have immensely increased their following and influence in the country, are not in possession of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> of Congress and Conference, are in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> zealously excluded from it by the present possessors and have but small following among the richer men who might provide the sinews of war. They are moreover prevented, by a natural unwillingness to hopelessly divide the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, from organising a machinery of their own. Yet to talk of organising the nation while excluding the new men is absurd. If the older party have the greater solidity and resources, the younger men have the lion's share of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and driving force, they divide the great middle class and are no longer there in a hopeless minority, but are gathering adherents all over the country (even in Madras they commanded one third of the votes at the last Conference) and they exercise an overwhelming empire over the minds of the rising generation. To organise the nation means to make all its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of strength efficient for a single clear and well-understood work under the leadership of a recognised central force. To exclude such important <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> as these we have described, means simply to leave the nation unorganised.\n\nThe country is in need of a statesman, yes: but what kind of statesman? He must be a man thoroughly steeped in the gospel of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, with a clear and fearless recognition of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> to which we are moving, with a dauntless courage to aim consciously, steadily, indomitably towards it, with a consummate<span class='page-number' id='s-631' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.631]</span> skill to mask his movements and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> when necessary and to move boldly and openly when necessary, and, last but not least, with an overmastering magnetic power and tact to lead and use and combine men of all kinds and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>. Such a leader might organise the nation to some purpose, but those who shrink from following where their hearts and intellects lead them or who from party <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> or personal dislike or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>jealousy</span> try to exclude powerful forces from the common national work cannot claim the name of statesman. It is an encouraging sign of the times that Surendranath is coming more and more into sympathy with thorough-going Nationalism, but will he have the courage and magnanimity to hold out his hand to the new men, and if he does will he be able to retain the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> of his principal followers?

If boycott had really been an impossibility or a failure, it is obvious that all this elaborate machinery would not have been brought into play to crush it. On the contrary it has become a very substantial reality, a very palpable success, and now stands out, as we have said, as the central and all-important question of Indian politics. Those who say that no nation was ever made by boycott, do not know what they are talking about, do not understand what boycott is, do not know the teachings of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. Boycott is much more than a mere economical device, it is a rediscovery of national self-respect, a declaration of national separateness: it is the first practical assertion of independence and has therefore in most of the national uprisings of modern times been the forerunner of the struggle for independence. The American struggle with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> began in an enthusiastic and determined boycott of British goods enforced by much the same methods as the Indian boycott but with a much more stringent<span class='page-number' id='s-638' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.638]</span> and effective organisation. The Italian uprising of 1848 was heralded by the boycott of Austrian cigarettes and the tobacco riots in Milan. The boycott was the indispensable weapon of the Parnell movement in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ireland</span>, and boycott and Swadeshi are the leading cries of Sinn Fein. The first practical effect of the resurgence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span> was the boycott of American goods as an assertion of China's long down-trodden self-respect against the brutal and insolent dealings of the Americans towards <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chinese</span> immigrants. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> also boycott began as an assertion of national self-respect, and continued as a declared and practical enforcement of national separateness, liberty, independence and self-dependence. \"We will no longer tamely bear injury and insult, we will no longer traffic and huckster with others for broken fragments of rights and privileges; we are free, we are separate, we are sufficient to ourselves for our own salvation,\" that was what boycott meant and what its enemies have understood it to mean: its economical aspect is only an aspect.\n\nThe economical boycott has been on the whole an immense success,â€”not indeed in every respect, for the crusade against foreign sugar has not diminished the import, though it may have checked to some extent the natural increase of the import, and the Tarpur sugar factory is, we understand, in danger of failing because people will not buy the dearer Swadeshi sugar,â€”an example of the futility of \"honest\" Swadeshi unsupported by a self-sacrificing boycott: but enormous reductions have been made in the import not only of cotton goods but of all kinds of wearing apparel, and salt has been appreciably affected. But now the whole weight of bureaucratic power is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> brought to bear in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to shatter the boycott, and if we intend to save it we must oppose the organised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of the bureaucracy by the organised will of the people. What the unorganised will of the people could do, it has done: it has indeed effected <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span>. But no statesman will rely on the perpetual continuation of a miracle, he will seek to counteract weaknesses, to take full advantage of every element of strength and to bring into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of strength: he will in short utilize every available means towards the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> great national end.

And the readiest way to organise the country is to organise boycott.\n\nThe chief weakness of the movement has been the want of co-ordinated action. We have left everything to personal and local enthusiasm. The consequence is that while in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> the boycott is a fact, in West Bengal it is an idea. There is some Swadeshi in West Bengal, there is no boycott. Moreover Bengal has not brought its united influence to bear upon the other provinces in order to make the boycott universal. The whole force of this vast country is a force which no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> could permanently resist. But this force has not been brought to bear on the struggle, Bengal and Punjab have been left to fight out their battles unaided, without the active sympathy of the rest of India. This must be altered, the rest of India must be converted and we must not rest till we have secured a mandate from the Congress for an universal boycott of British goods. Meanwhile we must bring West Bengal into a line with East Bengal, and for that purpose we must have a stringent and effective organisation. We need not go far for the system which will be most effective. We have only to apply or adapt to the circumstances of the country the methods used by the American boycotters against England.

We leave for the moment the truth of the statement which is contrary to the facts of history; but we should like to know what on earth our universal critic means by his Italian republics? There were republics in mediaeval <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span>, but we did not know that Naples and Sicily were republics under <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span> Bomba, or Rome under the Popes, or Tuscany under the Grand Duke, or Lombardy under the Austrians, or Sardinia and Piedmont under the descendants of Victor Amadeus. Then again Mr. Ghose has \"observed\" that the different States of Greece developed a national unity as soon as they had a common enemy in the Persian. Really? We had always thought that the one outstanding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> history was the utter inability of these states to develop national unity at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, the sentiment of Pan-Hellenism never having a look-in against the separatist spirit of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>city-states</span>. And then he tells us that the provinces and states of ancient Italy (whatever that may mean) also readily united intto make one great nation.o a great national state in the presence of a foreign enemy. Yet those foolish historians tell us that Italy was united not at all willingly by the Roman sword and the Carthaginian invasion simply tested the solidity of the Roman structure; it certainly did not create it. But it would be a wearisome task to<span class='page-number' id='s-641' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.641]</span> hunt down all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>errors</span> with which the article is packed. We think that after this Mr. N. N. Ghose had better stop questioning other people about their qualifications for instructing the people and examine his own.\n\nBut in spite of his historical blunders he has succeeded in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> expression to a very common error which troubles <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> patriotic people and unnerves their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and weakens the quality of their patriotism: \"Let it be distinctly remembered and never forgotten that the essential conditions of a nationality are unity of language, unity of religion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, unity of race.\" And because there is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> of race, religion and language in India he thinks that there is no possibility of creating a nationality in this country. This is a very common stumbling-block, but is there any reality in it? Rather we find that every nationality has been formed not because of, but in spite of, diversity of race or religion or language, and not unoften in spite of the co-existence of all these diversities. The *Indian Nation* has itself admitted that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> nation has been built out of various races, but he has not stated the full complexity of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British nation</span>. He has not observed that to this day the races which came later into the British nationality keep their distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> even now and that one of them clings to its language tenaciously. He has carefully omitted the striking example of Switzerland where distinct racial strains speaking three different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span> and, later, professing different religions coalesced into and persisted as one nation without sacrificing a single one of these diversities. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> three different languages are spoken, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> the candidates for the White House address the nation in fourteen languages, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Austria</span> is a congeries of races and languages, the divisions in Russia are hardly less acute. That unity in race, religion or language is essential to nationality is an idea which will not bear examination. Such <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of unity are very helpful to the growth of a nationality, but they are not essential and will not even of themselves assure its growth. The Roman Empire though it created a common language, a common religion and life, and did its best to crush out racial diversities under the heavy weight of its uniform system failed to make one great nation.<span class='page-number' id='s-642' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.642]</span>\n\nIf these are not essential elements of nationality, what, it may be asked, are the essential elements? We answer that there are certain essential conditions, geographical unity, a common past, a powerful common interest impelling towards unity and certain favourable political conditions which enable the impulse to realise itself in an organised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> expressing the nationality and perpetuating its single and united <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. This may be provided by a part of the nation, a race or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, uniting the others under its leadership or domination, or by an united resistance to a common pressure from outside or within. A common enthusiasm coalescing with a common interest is the most powerful fosterer of nationality. We believe that the necessary elements are present in India, we believe that the time has come and that by a common resistance to a common pressure in the shape of the boycott, inspired by a common enthusiasm and ideal, that united nationality for which the whole history of India has been a preparation, will be speedily and mightily accomplished.<span class='page-number' id='s-643' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.643]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-foundations-of-nationality","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Barbarities at Rawalpindi","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/barbarities-at-rawalpindi","prvt":"To Organise Boycott","prvu":"/cwsa/07/to-organise-boycott","dt":"1907-08-17","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["barbarities-at-rawalpindi"],"t":"Barbarities at Rawalpindi","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*The exact dates of the articles published here under \"August 20th\" are uncertain.

They demand an adequate response of stern and resolute work as an atonement and recompense for the sufferings of these martyrs. No patriot would shrink even from the agonies to which the accused are being subjected during the course of their trial at Rawalpindi if he could at least faintly hope from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of his countrymen that they would carry on the patriotic work undaunted and with a greater amount of determination and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>.

His faith is always his stay and support. But the martyrdom becomes easier if there is the prospect of some immediate benefit to the country resulting from his sufferings.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Rawalpindi trial, the bureaucratic law seems to have been whetted against the alleged offenders. The refusal of bail to the accused amongst whom<span class='page-number' id='s-644' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.644]</span> there are men of unquestioned respectability and integrity testifies to the petty vindictiveness of the judiciary which ostensibly exists to diminish crimes and not to exasperate people into their perpetration. The ill-treatment of the accused can without the least exaggeration be characterised as wanton <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>cruelty</span>. The accused after their experience of the British law courts will find it difficult to distinguish a judge from a mediaeval executioner. The Judge could not be moved to the most elementary feeling of humanity when the accused were overwhelmed by the most painful domestic calamities. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> man was not allowed to see his dying son till he actually expired and was past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> or need of help. This ferocity on the part of a tribunal, whose special study should be to abstain from writing the least punishment on a man till his guilt has been fairly established is a violation of the first principle of justice and turns a court of law into a torture chamber. A judge should not lack firmness in repressing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> but to pursue an alleged offender with implacable wrath from the moment of his arrest is an exhibition of vindictiveness and not of due judicial austerity. The trial has now extended over nearly two months and the sickening details of inhumanity practised upon the accused continue to be as distressing as ever.\n\nLala Hansraj and two or three others of his position have been detained in the prison without any justification. They are not the men who can even think of shirking the consequences of their patriotic actions under an alien rule. But why antedate their punishment from the very time of their arrest. They are not men accustomed to privations and they have all been showing signs of failing health during this pretty long period of police custody. They have already served out a term of punishment disproportionate to the nature of their alleged offence. It is a brand new feature of British justice to go on with the trial of men stretched on their sick-bed in the court room. Our latest telegram from Rawalpindi says that on the 16th Lala Hansraj was shaking with fever and ague on a string cot borrowed from a constable. The internal pain was so intense that tears ran down his cheeks though he tried to be firm and cheerful and pretended that something had fallen into his eyes.<span class='page-number' id='s-645' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.645]</span>\n\nWe need not multiply the details of the prisoners' sufferings. We have already sampled the treatment which the Pindi martyrs are receiving at the hands of the judiciary. We expect no mitigation of their sufferings. The alleged offence of rousing people to a spirit of active resistance perhaps justifies these barbarities in the eyes of the ruling class. They are innocent of all compunction and are calmly watching the effect on the people. The *Englishman* once opined that even the suspected offence of inciting to a riot excuses the most monstrous treatment of the offenders. But we believe their lesson will not be lost on our own countrymen. The heavy price that these men are paying for merely inducing the spirit of self-assertion in us should nerve others to greater and greater sacrifices in the service of the motherland.<span class='page-number' id='s-646' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.646]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/barbarities-at-rawalpindi","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The High Court Miracles","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-high-court-miracles","prvt":"The Foundations of Nationality","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-foundations-of-nationality","dt":"1907-08-20","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-high-court-miracles"],"t":"The High Court Miracles","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*The exact dates of the articles published here under \"August 20th\" are uncertain.

These conditions have been secured in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal and still more completely in the Punjab. But there is one weak point, the Achilles' heel in the otherwise invulnerable constitution of the bureaucracy, and that is the High Court of Bengal. The oldest and most venerable institution of British rule, with the most honourable traditions of integrity and independence maintained by a series of judges learned in the law, trained to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> and equity and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> judicial habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, the High Court had become a thing cherished and valued, a refuge to the oppressed, a guarantee of eventual relief against executive vagaries. It had therefore attracted an almost superstitious reverence and was the chief moral asset of British rule. But the inevitable tendency of bureaucratic rule when threatened by the increasing self-assertion of the people, began eventually to affect the High Court. It is true that the High Court is independent of the executive authorities, but it is under the control of the Chief Justice, and by the simple device of securing a Chief Justice of weak personality and multiplying civilian judges of the right kind the institution can easily be converted into a source of strength to the bureaucracy instead of a source of weakness. Since the beginning of the reactionary policy which followed the Viceroyalty of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> Ripon, this has been the increasing tendency of the High Court and the trust and reverence of the people has decreased proportionately, and the hold of British rule on their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imaginations</span> has decreased with it.<span class='page-number' id='s-647' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.647]</span>\n\nWe have always held that British justice as between Indians and Europeans or in cases in which the bureaucracy was judge, jury and accuser, must obviously and inevitably be a farce unless and until <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span></span> ceases to have any resemblance to its present self. Neither had we any of that enthusiastic admiration for British law and its administration which was not so very long ago the fashion among Indians of the educated class. On the contrary we were compelled to regard its procedure as costly, dilatory and often calculated to defeat justice, its penal system repressive and its punishments savage and barbarous with the cold civilised brutality of a half-baked incomplete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. Our respect for the High Court was tempered by a perception of the ease with which it could be captured by the bureaucracy for its own ends. We have therefore always decried the old moribund <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> in the excellence of the British courts and the tendency to run to them for protection in all cases of oppression and injustice. Have the recent transactions in the High Court proved us wrong? They have certainly proved that there are still Judges Indian and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> who can rise above the depressing atmosphere and lowered traditions of this once venerated institution and equal the distinguished record of those strong fearless Judges who have now become a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>memory</span>, almost a legend of the past. There has been nothing like the series of important decisions given in a few days by Justices Mitter and Fletcher since the seven Bishops were acquitted. The bold opposition of the sense of justice and respect for law to the interests of an irritated and determined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> in a time of great political unrest and disturbance, is an episode which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> will love to record. But is it more than an episode? We apprehend it is the last flaring up of the old fire previous to extinction. The executive will surely take care not to repeat the error by which a fearless, just and religious Hindu lawyer has been placed on the Criminal Bench side by side with a young barrister Judge fresh from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and still full of the uncorrupted moral temper natural in a free country.

The original Newmaniac of Calcutta had the National Volunteers for his special monomania: the *Times* specimen seems to have got the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arya Samaj</span> on his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>. In a long and elaborate article he has traced the genesis of this dangerous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span>, its control over the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bourgeoisie</span>, its deadly seditious attempts to make use of the masses, and the final extinction of the rebellious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> by the strong and masterly policy of Sir Denzil Ibbetson. All this reads well as the romance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>, but when it is given us as a serious attempt to account for the situation in the Punjab, we begin to see what a plentiful lack of wisdom and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> governs us in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. For we may be sure that the diet of lies which the *Times* correspondent serves up as a dainty dish for the British public, is merely a daintily-seasoned version of the official view in the Punjab. It is not to be questioned that the present struggle is a contest between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuals</span> of India who are recruited mainly from the middle class, and the alien officials. In the struggle the former are attempting to range all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> under the common banner of liberty and Indian resurgence, just as the same class has done in Russia, and there is nothing in the aim or the movement which is illegitimate or immoral. If there is any immorality, it is surely on the side of the ruling class which is fighting for monopoly and privilege while the bourgeoisie are fighting for their own self-preservation and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and expansion of their race and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. The *Times* correspondent speaks acutely enough when he says that the middle class are trying to make their will the will of the nation and the object of the bureaucracy must be to prevent that consummation. But when the writer begins to trace all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> to the Arya Samaj, he at once passes into the regions of romance. No doubt the lion's share of the political spirit and<span class='page-number' id='s-649' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.649]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> in the Punjab belongs to the Aryas, but that is the result of the manliness of the creed preached by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dayananda</span> and the admirable working power, self-sacrifice and gift of organisation which the Samaj has fostered among its members. But self-sacrifice, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, organisation are precisely what most terrify the panic-stricken Anglo-Indian, and nothing will convince him that where these are, there is not a dangerous conspiracy against the British Raj. We may tell this new Newmaniac that if there were such a serious and skilfully engineered movement as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> he affects to describe,â€”well, the special correspondent of the *Times* would not be touring at his ease and writing nonsense at the present moment.

The *Englishman* is perhaps the only Anglo-Indian paper in Calcutta which has a rigidly settled and consistent policy. Others allow themselves to be swayed sometimes by feeling and by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> dispassionate reason, and yield perhaps to some gust of generous feeling or suffer the sense of justice or fair play to overcome the dictates of class interest or policy, but Hare Street is above such weaknesses.

A violent and venomous opposition to every Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, to every claim to equality or even to ordinary justice, is the sole, simple and sufficient principle which guides it unerringly through the maze of politics. Legally the excited correspondents who pour out their fury and panic in its sympathetic pages, have not a leg to stand on. Some of them have made clumsy attempts to argue the point of agitation. The attempt is absurd. The position taken by the Judges is unassailable. Intention cannot be argued from the results of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, but from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the actions and utterances of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doer</span> and from the probable consequences of his act as they may be reasonably supposed to have presented themselves to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>. Now the actions of the assailants in this case were not such as to raise any certainty of their intention to kill. Men have been beaten by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and savagely beaten without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> left dead, but have at most had to spend more or less time in hospital recovering from their injuries. The cessation of the beating as soon as the victim fell down, the words of the<span class='page-number' id='s-651' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.651]</span> assailants as they ran away and several other circumstances seem to show that this was the result they aimed at, and the cumulative effect of these indications is very great. At any rate, in the face of such strong considerations in favour of the more lenient view, and in the absence of any positive evidence that the accused premeditated the assault, much less the manslaughter, any Judge knowing his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> would feel himself bound to give them the benefit of the doubt so long as the principle of refusing to convict on a mere probability of guilt remains a fundamental principle of law. We can say without any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of contradiction that the *Englishman* would not have a word to say against the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Judgment</span> if it had been any other than an European who had died: and if it had been an Indian done to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> by an Englishman, Hare Street would have yelled itself hoarse over the brutal severity of the sentences. The position taken up is that because an Englishman was killed, somebody ought to have been hanged and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> who were not hanged transported for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>: otherwise the life of planters in the mofussil cannot be safe. Possibly, but the safety of European life in the mofussil is an extrajudicial consideration with which the Judges of the High Court, or any judges for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of that, are not concerned. Their sole business is to do justice, without any regard to the political consequences. The safety of European life is a question for the executive or for the political authorities. If the planters have made themselves so fiercely hated or the bureaucrats have by their policy rendered Europeans such an eyesore to the Indian masses that the latter are ready to murder them without serious provocation and can only be restrained by savage and iniquitous sentences in the law courts, it is for the planters and the bureaucrats to mend their ways and ease the tension: they cannot expect just and upright men to stain their consciences for their sake.<span class='page-number' id='s-652' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.652]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/a-malicious-persistence","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"In Melancholy Vein","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/in-melancholy-vein","prvt":"The Times Romancist","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-times-romancist","dt":"1907-08-21","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["in-melancholy-vein"],"t":"In Melancholy Vein","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The *Englishman* is in melancholy mood.

We shall find it hard to believe that there is any lack of imagination in Hare Street existence, but this new-born desire to turn the imagination from the gaseous into the solid state is a hopeful sign. Our contemporary anticipates all sorts of curious and pleasing results from his new departure, and even breaks out into irregular blank verse in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span>. \"Then comes again the care-free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of youth, the lines of trouble fade from the face, the empty pocket, like that of Virgil's traveller, becomes a cause for song, or like that of the schoolboy, a hoarding place for curious and assorted treasure.\" We are sorry to hear that the *Englishman*'s pocket is empty, but we think he goes too far in expecting people to write poetry about his diminishing sale and circulation. As for his alternative hope, the *Englishman*'s pocket whether empty of cash or not, is full enough of Golden <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> Mare's nests, Newmaniac effusions and other curious and assorted treasure.

But in these days I feel that young men can very often give better advice than we older people can give. Nor must you ask me to express the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> which your actions, the way in which you have shown your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> towards me, have given rise to in my breast. It is impossible to express them. You <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> know that I have resigned my post. In the meeting you held yesterday I see that you expressed sympathy with me in what you <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> my present troubles. I don't know whether I should call them troubles at all, for the experience that I am going to undergo was long foreseen as inevitable in the discharge of the mission that I have taken up from my childhood, and I am approaching it without regret. What I want to be assured of is not so much that you feel sympathy for me in my troubles, but that you have sympathy for the cause in serving which I have to undergo what you call my troubles. If I know that the rising generation have taken up this cause, that wherever I go, I go leaving behind others to carry on my work, I shall go without the least regret. I take it that whatever respect you have shown to me today was shown not to me, not merely even to the principal, but to your country, to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> in me, because what little I have done has been done for her, and the slight suffering that I am going to endure will be endured for her sake. Taking your sympathy in that light I can feel that if I am incapacitated from carrying on my work, there will be so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> others left behind me. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> other cause of rejoicing for me is to find that practically all my countrymen have the same fellow-feeling for me and for the same reason as yourselves. The unanimity with which all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> have expressed their sympathy for me and even offered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> at<span class='page-number' id='s-655' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.655]</span> the moment of my trial, is a cause for rejoicing, and for the same reason. For I am nothing, what I have done is nothing. I have earned this fellow-feeling because of serving the cause which all my countrymen have at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>.\n\nThe only piece of advice that I can give you now isâ€”carry out the work, the mission, for which this college was created. I have no doubt that all of you have realised by this time what this mission means. When we established this college, and left other occupations, other chances of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, to devote our lives to this institution, we did so because we hoped to see in it the foundation, the nucleus, of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> which is to begin its career after this night of sorrow and trouble, on that day of glory and greatness when India will work for the world. What we want here is not merely to give you a little information, not merely to open to you careers for earning a livelihood, but to build up sons for the motherland to work and to suffer for her. That is why we started this college and that is the work to which I want you to devote yourselves in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. What has been insufficiently and imperfectly begun by us, it is for you to complete and lead to perfection. When I come back I wish to see some of you <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> rich, rich not for yourselves but that you may enrich the Mother with your riches. I wish to see some of you becoming great, great not for your own sakes, not that you may satisfy your own vanity, but great for her, to make India great, to enable her to stand up with head erect among the nations of the earth, as she did in days of yore when the world looked up to her for light. Even those who will remain poor and obscure, I want to see their very poverty and obscurity devoted to the motherland. There are times in a nation's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> when Providence places before it one work, one aim, to which everything else, however high and noble in itself, has to be sacrificed. Such a time has now arrived for our motherland when nothing is dearer than her service, when everything else is to be directed to that end. If you will study, study for her sake; train yourselves <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and soul for her service. You will earn your living that you may live for her sake. You will go abroad to foreign lands that you may<span class='page-number' id='s-656' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.656]</span> bring back <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> with which you may do service to her. Work that she may prosper. Suffer that she may rejoice. All is contained in that one single advice.

He has attempted to answer our criticism in this week's *Indian Nation*, but the answer is so much befouled with an almost maniacal virulence of abuse that most of our friends have advised us to ignore his frenzies and never again give him the notoriety he <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> by noticing him in our columns. It is true that the *Indian Nation* addresses itself to a microscopic audience and expresses the personal vanities, selfishness, jealousies of a single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, but so long as it enjoys a false reputation for learning and wisdom even with a limited circle or trades on that reputation to attack and discredit the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, it is our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to expose its pretensions, and we shall not be deterred by any abuse, however foul.\n\nMr. N. N. Ghose's reply falls into three parts, of which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> consists merely of rancorous vituperation, another of a feeble attempt to wriggle out of the uncomfortable position he has got into by his failure to consult a few historical primers before writing, and the third is a restatement of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> formulated this time in the shape of general ideas<span class='page-number' id='s-658' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.658]</span> without any basis either of historical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> or of Metropolitan College <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span>. As to the abuse we can only say that it might have been more skilfully done. At least it might have been more coherent. The aggrieved sage of Sankaritola picks out from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the *Bande Mataram* writers Srijut Aurobindo Ghose for the object of his wrath and among other elegant terms of abuse calls him a prig and a *Graeculus esuriens*. To those who may not be such accomplished Latin scholars as the Principal of the Metropolitan College, we may explain that the last <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> means a starving and greedy scholar who is prepared to commit any vileness for the sake of earning a livelihood. We will not stop to ask whether this description applies to Srijut Aurobindo Ghose or to a Principal who daily exhorts his students to subordinate honour, high feeling and patriotism to the supreme consideration of bread and himself practises the lofty philosophy he preaches. We will only ask Mr. Ghose whether a man can be at once a prig and an *esurient Greekling*. Srijut Aurobindo Ghose may be one or the other or neither, but he can hardly be both. Either Mr. N. N. Ghose's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of Latin is as distinguished and correct as his knowledge of history, or else he is so ignorant of English as to be even ignorant what the word prig means. We can understand his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> in a rage at the merciless exposure of his pretended scholarship, but that does not excuse his incoherence: nor is it a sufficient reason for what was once a fair counterfeit of a gentleman and a scholar turning himself into the image of a spitting and swearing tom-cat. And with that we leave Mr. N. N. Ghose the fishwife and pass on to Mr. N. N. Ghose the historian.\n\nHe does not try to justify his blunders,â€”that would be hopelessâ€”but he does try to excuse them. He practically admits that his Italian republics are a blunder and that he was thinking of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Middle Ages</span> when he was writing of the nineteenth century. But he pleads that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burke</span> uses the word <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commonwealth</span> in the sense of state and therefore Mr. N. N. Ghose can use the word republic in the same sense. This is Metropolitan College <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> and Metropolitan College knowledge of English. Does Mr. Ghose really think that republic and commonwealth mean the<span class='page-number' id='s-659' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.659]</span> same thing precisely or that Burke would have talked of the Russian republic when he meant the Russian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>monarchy</span>? But, says Mr. Ghose, it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, as I was not talking about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span>. But if Mr. Ghose in his class was to talk about adjectives when he meant nouns, would it be an excuse to say that he was not talking about the difference between various parts of speech? His defence of his other blunders is still more amusing.\n\nSays the Oracle: \"To combat our proposition about ancient Greece an academic commonplace is trotted out, namely, that the people of Greece never developed a Pan-Hellenic sentiment.\" Really this is enough to take one's breath away. Mr. Ghose told us last week that the Greeks became an united nation under the pressure of the Persian invasion: this week he coolly tells us that it is an academic commonplace that the Greeks never even developed a Pan-hellenic sentiment. We certainly never said anything of the sort. The Greeks, as any tyro in history knows, did develop a Pan-hellenic sentiment but it was never strong enoughâ€”and that was all we saidâ€”to unite them into a nation. But Mr. Ghose flounders still deeper into the mire in the next sentences. \"What does it signify whether they did or not? The whole question is, could the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> states have been set against one another? <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Athens</span> and Sparta, for instance, against each other? And if not, why not?\" Really, Mr. Ghose, really now! Is it possible you do not know that soon after the Persian invasion which you say made Greece an united nation, Athens and Sparta were at each other's throats and the whole of the Greek world by land and sea turned into one vast battlefield on which the Hellenic cities engaged in a murderous internecine strife? What would we think of a \"scholar\" who pretended to know Indian history and yet asserted that the Hindus became an united nation under the pressure of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> invasion and that it was impossible to set the Hindu states against each other, Mewar and Amber for instance? Yet this is precisely the blunder Mr. Ghose has committed with respect to Greek history. But he pleads bitterly that his facts are no doubt all wrong, but the conclusions he bases on them are right. What do facts matter? It is only Mr. N. N. Ghose's opinions which matter.<span class='page-number' id='s-660' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.660]</span>\n\nMr. Ghose accuses us of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>incapacity</span> to understand the substance of his article. We quite admit that it is difficult to understand the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mystic</span> wisdom of a sage who asserts that the soundness of his premises has nothing to do with the soundness of his conclusions. Mr. Ghose stated certain facts as supporting a conclusion otherwise unsupported. We have proved that his facts are all childish blunders. He must therefore accept one of the two horns of a dilemma; either his facts had nothing to do with his \"truism\" or his \"truism\" itself is an error. But we had another object in view in exposing the pretentious sciolism of this arrogant publicist. Our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> with him is not so much to disprove his opinions as to convince the few who still believe in him of the hollowness of his pretensions. It was for this reason that we dwelt on his blunders last week and have done the same this week,â€”in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to show that this gentleman who claims a monopoly of culture and wisdom in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, is a half educated shallow man whose boasted mastery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span> even is imperfect and who in other subjects, such as history and politics, is an ignoramus pretending to knowledge.<span class='page-number' id='s-661' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.661]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/sankaritolas-apologia","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Our False Friends","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/our-false-friends","prvt":"Advice to National College Students: Speech","prvu":"/cwsa/07/advice-to-national-college-students-speech","dt":"1907-08-24","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["our-false-friends"],"t":"Our False Friends","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The *Englishman* has been warning us against our false friends.

This freedom is perhaps responsible for the banishment of an Arya Samajist from his country though the trying magistrate has declared him quite innocent of the charge brought against him.

N. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> has again attempted to answer us in his issue of the 26th August. As usual the bulk of his answer is composed of irrelevant abuse, but we are glad to note that except towards the end where his passion of spite and wounded vanity has broken out in a furious yell of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, he has tried to curb his natural inclination to couch the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> of Billingsgate in the language of the gutter. We pointed out that Mr. N. N. Ghose's \"historical facts\"â€”which he had brought forward to prove his theory that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationality</span> was possible everywhere except in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>,â€”were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> blunders of which a schoolboy would have been ashamed, and we drew the inevitable conclusion that the sage of Sankaritola was an ignoramus in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. That was exceedingly plain language, no doubt, but it was relevant to the issue. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who knows nothing about history, has no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> to argue from history and foist on the public conclusions drawn from his own imagination or from others and distorted in the borrowing under the disingenuous pretence that they are the \"laws of national growth\" as ascertained from an accurate study of the world's past experience. And what is Mr. N. N. Ghose's answer? His answer is that Srijut Aurobindo Ghose<span class='page-number' id='s-666' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.666]</span> is a coward and had not courage to ride a horse and that he would never have been a patriot if he had not failed in the Indian Civil Service. Even if that be true,â€”and we can hardly blame the Principal of the Metropolitan College for judging others by his own standard of courage and patriotismâ€”we do not see how it helps his case or goes to prove that his bad premises do not vitiate his conclusions or that Nationality is impossible in India. The question is not whether Srijut Aurobindo Ghose is a coward and a self-seeker but whether Mr. N. N. Ghose is wrong in his facts and in his conclusions. With regard to the facts he has practically admitted defeat. He admits that he is an ignoramus, he admits that the depths of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> have been proved to be unfathomable. We can therefore leave him alone in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and confine ourselves to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>. An ignoramus who pretends to a monopoly of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> and wisdom, and is always questioning other people about their educational qualifications, makes himself offensive and deserves to be exposed but an ignoramus who confesses that he is an ignoramus is harmless and even an object of kindly pity.\n\nMr. Ghose argues that though his facts were wrong, that does not prove that his conclusions were not right. Perhaps not, but it at least creates a presumption in that direction. We shall however leave his self-justification on this point for future treatment and deal with the more substantial issues he has raised in his defence.\n\nMr. N. N. Ghose's positionâ€”and we notice it only because it is the position of better men than heâ€”is contained in the following luminous sentence: \"The bookish politician is not able to cite a single instance where a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> was made by boycott or under any conditions other than the unities we have more than once referred to.\" Here there are two propositions, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>, that boycott never made a nation, the other that in every case of the building up of a nationality there have been present as indispensable conditions and the only causes of the growth of nationality Mr. Ghose's three precious unities,â€”viz., a single language, a single race, a single religion. A more shallow, ignorant and unfounded brace of assertions it would be difficult to imagine. We pointed out in the first article in which we condescended to notice Mr. Ghose's flounderings, several instances of nations which have been welded into unity and maintained their unity without possessing a single one of these indispensable \"unities\". As for unity of race there is not a single one of the European nations which is not a compound of several races except, possibly, the Scandinavian peoples. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> up to the present day the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Celtic races</span> preserve their separateness and distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>: in<span class='page-number' id='s-667' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.667]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Austria</span> there are a superfluity of different races and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span>: Russia is a congeries of peoples: <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> was built up out of various races and even after the accomplishment of national unity the Gallo-Lombard of the North and the Latins, Oscans, Umbrians, Tuscans of the Centre find it difficult to understand and live with the Graeco-Italians of the South: in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> the Prussian, the Slav, the Pole, and the South German are of different race types and temperaments: in Spain the Iberian, the Goth and the Moor have mingled their blood: in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> there are the Breton, still a distinct race, the Provencal and the Frank as well as the Celts of the Centre and the Aquitanian, each with noticeable marks of their separate origin: in Switzerland there are three races speaking three different languages. Does Mr. N. N. Ghose want any more instances? We can give him plenty if he does. If he had even the most insignificant knowledge of common facts, he would not have needed our assistance to enlighten him on the subject. Everyone knows, except the Sankaritola sage, that race and nationality are two totally different things which have no necessary relation to each other, since one depends upon common descent while the other is a geographical and political unity. One might just as well say that different chemical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> cannot combine into a single substance as that different races cannot combine into a single nation. There is no such irreconcilable divergence between the races in India as to make their union an impossibility. If we turn to unity of language we find a respectable number of nations which do not speak a single language. Three languages are spoken in Switzerland, the same number in France, while Welsh holds its own in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Great Britain</span>. Unity of language, therefore, is not necessary to nationality, only the recognition of one prevalent language as the State language is required. If <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span>, needing to be addressed in fourteen languages by her would-be Presidents is a nation, if the Swiss speaking three different languages on equal terms are a nation, what reason is there that the people of India should not federate into a single political unity? As for the religious difficulty, it is an old bogey. We do not deny the difficulty created by the divisions between the Mahomedans and Hindus, but it is idle to<span class='page-number' id='s-668' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.668]</span> say that the difficulty is insuperable. If the spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationalism</span> conquered the much fiercer intolerance of the religious struggles in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> after the reformation, it is not irrational to hope as much for India in the twentieth century. We have not seen in Mr. N. N. Ghose's polemics a single argument or favourable instance for his pretentious theory of the three unities of nationalism. We do not deny that it would be a great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to us if we had a single language or professed a single religion. But we do deny that these \"unities\", still less the unity of race, are indispensable.

Without touching on the relations of this affair with the *Bande Mataram* case we shall say what we have to say on the political aspect of the vindictive sentence passed by the third Presidency Magistrate, an obscure servant of the bureaucracy, on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> with a great and historic mission whom the strange incongruous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Fate</span> brought before his petty judgment-seat.\n\nSrijut Bipin Chandra Pal has been condemned to six months' simple imprisonment, the maximum penalty permitted by the law for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> of possessing a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>.

Apart from the large assumption involved in the assertion that his evidence would have materially assisted the prosecution this appears to us a singular plea for a lawyer to put forward. It has not yet been made a crime punishable under the Penal Code to baulk a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> prosecution and if it was the intention to draw the Magistrate's attention to the political bearings of the case, it was at least<span class='page-number' id='s-672' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.672]</span> maladroit to allow the suggestion to be palpable. We will take it, however, that the Magistrate sentenced Bipin Babu for a breach of the law which the defendant did not deny, not for an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of which there was no evidence and which is not an offence under the law. What then was Bipin Babu's offence? Certainly it was not that he carried the policy of Boycott <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the limits of legality and preferred adhesion to his own political programme before the dictates of the alien's law. That would have been an action which, however pardonable or praiseworthy in the eyes of patriots engaged in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> struggle with the bureaucracy, must necessarily figure as a serious offence in the eyes of the bureaucracy itself and we could hardly quarrel with its servant for trying to serve the interests of his employers by the infliction of a severe punishment. But it was distinctly declared by Bipin Babu that it was not as a boycotter, not with the political intention of making the working of the bureaucratic law-courts impossible that he declined to give evidence or take the oath. The boycott in Bengal has not yet been extended in practice to the law courts, and even in theory it is proposed to extend it only to voluntary resort to the protection of the alien authorities and not to cases in which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> is compelled to them by a warrant or a summons. A few men like Bhupendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> who have realised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> in their souls and refuse to be bound by any limitations of an alien making, may decline to have anything to do with the law which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> had no hand in framing and the courts over which the nation has no control, but this has not yet become the accepted policy of the New Party and there was no moral compulsion on its leader to make any such refusal. If it had been an ordinary case of crime, he would not have refused to give evidence. It was, in fact, as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> case of conscience that he regarded the question. In his first statement Bipin Babu declared that it was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of a citizen to refuse to take any part in such cases which are manifestly unjust and injurious to society and the peace of the country. In his later statement the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> about the duty of the citizen was, wisely we think, dropped: for we in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> are not citizens and having no rights of citizenship cannot be saddled with any duties of citizenship.<span class='page-number' id='s-673' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.673]</span> The members of a subject nation absolutely destitute of any inalienable rights cannot have any moral obligations as citizens: they can only have moral obligations as patriots and subject to their patriotic obligations, as members of a social <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>. If therefore we recognise any obligation to respect and obey the law, it is not as citizens but as members of the social order who are interested in its maintenance and in the maintenance of peace and order so long as and no longer than that order and peace do not militate against the well-being of the society instead of promoting it. The moment <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to the law involves a wound to society, the individual is brought face to face with a difficult case of conscience.\n\nIt was in such a difficult situation that Bipin Babu found himself. He was called on to associate himself as a prosecution witness with a political policy carried on under the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of law, a policy which he considered fatal to the well-being and peace of the nation, but which he had no means of challenging except by the passive protest of refusing to perform the function required of him. He had to obey either the dictates of his con science or the requirements of the law and he held the imperative command of his conscience a more sacred and binding law than the Penal Code. The law had a right to assert itself by inflicting on him a nominal or slight penalty, it had no right to punish a man vindictively for obeying his conscience. The Magistrate thought perhaps that he was serving the interests of the present system and ensuring its stability by putting Bipin Pal in prison for six months, but what has he really done? Merely made people believe that the bureaucracy is so savage in its repression, so enamoured of power, that for its sake it will not even allow a man to possess a conscience, that an honest and reluctant protest on the part of a distinguished and honourable man against a misuse of the law will be punished by it with eager severity if it happens to conflict with its own interests or its repressive policy.\n\nThe country will not suffer by the incarceration of this great orator and writer, this spokesman and prophet of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, nor will Bipin Chandra himself suffer by it.

The truth that he inculcates has had its martyrs in every country of the world and it cannot be otherwise in India. Everything that he asks of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> requires sacrifice, and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that the nation that has been under subjection for centuries may awaken to the truth of his idea, to the greatness of his faith, he must be the first to set the example.

The mere logical superiority of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> to Moderation cannot be reasonably expected to revolutionise Indian politics; that superiority must be supplemented by the full measure of personal sacrifices on the part of the exponents of the new faith. The Nationalists have been dwelling on two propositions mainly, namely, that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> is the primary necessity of the country, and that freedom can be won only by struggle and sacrifice.

The hour of trial has arrived, let them stand firm.\n\nEvery act of sacrifice that the Nationalist now performs in fulfilment of his mission will advance his cause by bounds. It will bring home to his countrymen the reality of Nationalism over and against the unreality of Moderation.

In the ideal of Nationalism which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> will set before the world, there will be an essential equality between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and man, between caste and caste, between class and class, all being as Mr. Tilak has pointed out different but equal and united parts of the Virat Purusha as realised in the nation. The insistent preaching of our religion and the work of the Indian Nationalist is to bring home to every one of his countrymen this ideal of their country's religion and philosophy. We are intolerant of autocracy because it is the denial in politics of this essential equality, we object to the modern distortion of the caste system because it is the denial in society of the same essential equality. While we insist<span class='page-number' id='s-679' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.679]</span> on reorganising the nation into a democratic unity politically, we recognise that the same principle of reorganisation ought to and inevitably will assert itself socially; even if, as our opponents choose to imagine, we are desirous of confining its working to politics, our attempts will be fruitless, for the principle once realised in politics must inevitably assert itself in society. No monopoly racial or hereditary can form part of the Nationalist's scheme of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, his dream of the day for the advent of which he is striving and struggling.\n\nThe caste system was once productive of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, and as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> has been a necessary phase of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human progress</span> through which all the civilizations of the world have had to pass. The autocratic form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> has similarly had its use in the development of the world's polity, for there was certainly a time when it was the only kind of political organisation that made the preservation of society possible. The Nationalist does not quarrel with the past, but he insists on its transformation, the transformation of individual or class autocracy into the autocracy, self-rule or Swaraj, of the nation and of the fixed, hereditary, anti-democratic caste-organisation into the pliable, self-adapting, democratic distribution of function at which socialism <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>. In the present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> in politics and the present narrow caste-organisation in society he finds a negation of that equality which his religion enjoins. Both must be transformed. The historic problem that the present attitude of Indian Nationalism at once brings to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, as to how a caste-governed society could co-exist with a democratic religion and philosophy, we do not propose to consider here today. We only point out that Indian Nationalism must by its inherent tendencies move towards the removal of unreasoning and arbitrary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> and inequalities.

There is just a little flaw in this advice of the Anglo-Indian monitors, it puts the cart before the horse, and that is the reason why we have always refused to act upon it.\n\nIt does not require much expenditure of thought to find<span class='page-number' id='s-680' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.680]</span> out that the only way to rid the human mind of abuses and superstitions is through a transformation of spirit and not merely of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span>. We must educate every Indian, man, woman and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> of our religion and philosophy before we can rationally expect our society to reshape itself in the full and perfect spirit of the Vedantic gospel of equality. We dwell on this commonsense idea here at the risk of being guilty of repetition. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span> on a national scale is an indispensable precondition of our social amelioration. And because such education is impossible except through the aid of state-finance, therefore, even if there were no other reason, the Nationalist must emphasise the immediate need of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> without which Indians cannot obtain the necessary control over their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span>.

Apart from the question of the cultivation of those virtues which only come in the wake of liberty, apart from the question of reorganisation of the country, if we were to look into the problem in its purely social aspect, even then we are confronted with the primary need of political emancipation as the condition precedent of further fruitful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>.\n\nThe Nationalist has been putting the main stress on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of political freedom almost to the exclusion of the other needs of the nation, not because he is not alive to the vital importance of those needs of economic renovation, of education, of social transformation, but because he knows that in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that his ideal of equality may be brought to its fullest fruition, he must first bring about the political freedom and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>federation</span> of his country.<span class='page-number' id='s-681' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.681]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-un-hindu-spirit-of-caste-rigidity","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Caste and Democracy","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-democracy","prvt":"Sacrifice and Redemption","prvu":"/cwsa/07/sacrifice-and-redemption","dt":"1907-09-20","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["caste-and-democracy"],"t":"Caste and Democracy","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> our correspondent who has criticised on another page the consistency of our views on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>, has hardly taken any trouble to understand the real drift of our articles. His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> seems to be that we must be either entirely for caste as it at present exists or entirely against the institution and condemn it root and branch in the style of the ordinary unthinking social reformer. Because on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> hand we protested against the ignorant abuse of the institution often indulged in simply because it is different in form and spirit from European institutions, and on the other hand emphasized the perversions of its form and spirit and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of its transformation in the pure spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hinduism</span>, our correspondent imagines that we are inconsistent and guilty of adopting successively two different and incompatible attitudes. Our position is perfectly clear and straightforward. Caste was originally an arrangement for the distribution of functions in society, just as much as class in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>, but the principle on which the distribution was based in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> was peculiar to this country. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> of Europe has always been preponderatingly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> was material in its principles and material in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, but our civilisation has always been preponderatingly spiritual and moral, and caste division in India had a spiritual object and a spiritual and moral basis. The division of classes in Europe had its root in a distribution of powers and rights and developed and still develops through a struggle of conflicting interests; its aim was merely the organisation of society for its own sake and mainly indeed for its economic convenience. The division of castes in India was conceived as a distribution of duties. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>'s caste depended on his *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>*, his<span class='page-number' id='s-682' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.682]</span> spiritual, moral and practical duties, and his *dharma* depended on his *swabhava*, his temperament and inborn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. A Brahmin was a Brahmin not by mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, but because he discharged the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of preserving the spiritual and intellectual elevation of the race, and he had to cultivate the spiritual temperament and acquire the spiritual training which could alone qualify him for the task. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span> was a Kshatriya not merely because he was the son of warriors and princes, but because he discharged the duty of protecting the country and preserving the high courage and manhood of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, and he had to cultivate the princely temperament and acquire the strong and lofty Samurai training which alone fitted him for his duties. So it was with the Vaishya whose function was to amass wealth for the race and the Sudra who discharged the humbler duties of service without which the other castes could not perform their share of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for the common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>. This was what we meant when we said that caste was a socialistic institution. No doubt there was a gradation of social respect which placed the function of the Brahmin at the summit and the function of the Sudra at the base, but this inequality was accidental, external, *vyavaharika*. Essentially there was, between the devout Brahmin and the devout Sudra, no inequality in the single Virat Purusha of which each was a necessary part. Chokha Mela, the Maratha Pariah, became the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guru</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahmins</span> proud of their caste purity; the Chandala taught Shankaracharya: for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahman</span> was revealed in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of the Pariah and in the Chandala there was the utter presence of Shiva the Almighty. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Heredity</span> entered into caste divisions, and in the light of the conclusions of modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> who shall say erroneously? But it entered into it as a subordinate element. For Hindu civilisation <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> spiritual based its institutions on spiritual and moral foundations and subordinated the material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> and material considerations. Caste therefore was not only an institution which ought to be immune from the cheap second-hand denunciations so long in fashion, but a supreme necessity without which Hindu civilisation could not have developed its distinctive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> or worked out its unique mission.\n\nBut to recognise this is not to debar ourselves from pointing<span class='page-number' id='s-683' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.683]</span> out its later perversions and desiring its transformation. It is the nature of human institutions to degenerate, to lose their vitality, and decay, and the first sign of decay is the loss of flexibility and oblivion of the essential spirit in which they were conceived. The spirit is permanent, the body changes; and a body which refuses to change must die. The spirit expresses itself in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> ways while itself remaining essentially the same, but the body must change to suit its changing environments if it wishes to live. There is no doubt that the institution of caste degenerated. It ceased to be determined by spiritual qualifications which, once essential, have now come to be subordinate and even immaterial and is determined by the purely material tests of occupation and birth. By this change it has set itself against the fundamental tendency of Hinduism which is to insist on the spiritual and subordinate the material and thus lost most of its meaning. The spirit of caste arrogance, exclusiveness and superiority came to dominate it instead of the spirit of duty, and the change weakened the nation and helped to reduce us to our present condition. It is these perversions which we wish to see set right. The institution must transform itself so as to fulfil its essential and permanent object under the changed conditions of modern times. If it refuses to change, it will become a mere social survival and crumble to pieces. If it transforms itself, it will yet play a great part in the fulfilment of civilisation.\n\nOur correspondent accuses us of attempting to corrupt society with the intrusion of the European idea of Socialism. Socialism is not an European idea, it is essentially Asiatic and especially Indian. What is called Socialism in Europe, is the old Asiatic attempt to effect a permanent solution of the economic problem of society which will give man leisure and peace to develop undisturbed his higher self. Without Socialism <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> would remain a tendency that never reached its fulfilment, a rule of the masses by a small aristocratic or monied class with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> and votes of the masses, or a tyranny of the artisan classes over the rest.

This spirit has been exposed in a lurid and sensational manner in the Comilla case when an innocent man with difficulty escaped the gallows to which a political prosecution had condemned him. But in the *Bande Mataram* case also there has been a less sensational though sufficient exposure of the same sinister spirit. What has been the whole meaning and aim of this prosecution? Certainly not an honest impartial desire to vindicate outraged law and check without personal animus or any purely political aim a wanton tendency to disturb the public tranquillity, which would be the only excuse for a sedition prosecution. It has been an obvious attempt to crush a particular paper and a particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>. The bureaucracy has sought to cripple or silence the *Bande Mataram* because it has been preaching with extraordinary success a political creed which was dangerous to the continuance of bureaucratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> and was threatening to become a centre of strength round which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> Nationalistic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> might gather. It has sought to single out and silence a particular individual because it chose to think that he was, as the Friend of India expresses it, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> behind the policy of the paper. If we are challenged to justify this assertion,<span class='page-number' id='s-687' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.687]</span> it will be sufficient to point to the conduct of this case from its very inception. The *Bande Mataram* has been for over a year attacking without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> and without disguise the present system of government and advocating a radical and revolutionary change. It has advocated that change on grounds of historical experience, the first principles of politics and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of national self-preservation. It has not minced matters or sought to conceal revolutionary aspirations under the veil of moderate professions or ambiguous phraseology. It has not concealed its opinion that the bureaucracy cannot be expected to transform itself, that the people of India and not the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> must save India, and that we cannot hope for any boons but must wrest what we desire by strong national combination from unwilling hands. Hundreds of articles have appeared in the paper in this vein and the bureaucrats had only to pick and choose. But they have not attacked one of these articles, nor did their counsel venture to cite even a single one of them to prove seditious intention. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> is that, however dangerous such a propaganda may be to an absolutist handful desiring to perpetuate their irresponsible rule, no government pretending to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> itself civilised can prosecute it as seditious without forfeiting all claim to the last vestige of the world's respect. But though the paper could not be characterised as seditious, it was highly inconvenient, and there was a growing clamour which extended even to the cloudy home of the Thunderer in London, for its prosecution and, if possible, suppression. And so watch is kept to find the paper tripping over some trifle, for which it can be hauled up and got into trouble on a side issue. What is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> for which the *Bande Mataram* was prosecuted? A reprint of the official translations of certain articles from a vernacular paper, translations issued as part of a case in the law-courts and reproduced as such, that is one count; and an insignificant correspondence which does not even profess to give voice to the policy of the paper, that is the second and third; and there is no other. The *Yugantar* was prosecuted on articles expressing its essential policy; the *Sandhya* has been proceeded against on articles expressing its views on important matters; but it was sought to crush the *Bande<span class='page-number' id='s-688' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.688]</span> Mataram* partly for a technical offence and partly on a side-issue. So eagerly, so carelessly is the casual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> given snatched at that the executive do not even trouble to know what is the article on which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> taken; they give sanction to prosecute on an advertisement in the right-hand corner of the paper, and but for the compassionate correction vouchsafed by an officer of the Company the mistake would have had to be rectified in the course of the trial itself. Sanction is given to prosecute a nameless Editor and the police at once proceed to ask for a warrant against Aurobindo <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span>. It is in evidence that they had nothing better to go on than hearsay. But they had no hesitation in immediately pouncing on one particular writer of the *Bande Mataram* without possessing the least scrap of evidence against him. Obviously they cannot have done this without instructions. It was popularly believed that Srijut Aurobindo Ghose was all in all on the *Bande Mataram* staff, that all the best articles were written by him, that he gave the tone of the paper and that it could not last without him. Why did the police take a body-warrant against Aurobindo Ghose to the office and why, having taken it, did they not arrest him? Obviously they took it because they thought that they would find plenty of evidence against him in the search, and they did not execute it because they found that not a scrap of proof rewarded their efforts. After that there was a pause till Anukul <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mukherji</span> testimony was secured, and on that flimsy evidence the trial was started. Had it been honestly intended to deal only with the Editor, whoever he might turn out to be, the proceedings against Aurobindo Ghose would have been given up, but the police made no secret of the fact that it was this one man who was wanted and that no other, whatever the evidence against him, would be thought worth capture. Even when the case for the prosecution was complete without any evidence fit to raise more than a flimsy presumption the Standing Counsel would not give up, but in an outrageous address in which he rode roughshod over the higher traditions of his office, pressed weak points and wrested ambiguous evidence to get the charge framed. And after Anukul had broken down in cross-examination and made admissions fatal to their case, still<span class='page-number' id='s-689' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.689]</span> the prosecution struggled for a verdict. And with what result? Even a civilian Magistrate willing to support the prestige of the Government had more sense of law and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> than the bureaucracy and its advisers and was able to see that a man could not be sent to two years' rigorous imprisonment without any shadow of evidence. Their prey escaped them; the Manager who seems to have been arrested on spec and tried without even any pretence that there was any evidence against him was acquitted, and only an unfortunate Printer who knew no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> and had no notion what all the pother was about, was sent to prison for a few months to vindicate the much-damaged majesty of the almighty bureaucracy.<span class='page-number' id='s-690' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.690]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/bande-mataram-prosecution","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Pioneer or Hindu Patriot?","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/pioneer-or-hindu-patriot","prvt":"Caste and Democracy","prvu":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-democracy","dt":"1907-09-25","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["pioneer-or-hindu-patriot"],"t":"Pioneer or Hindu Patriot?","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Here is a precious paragraph from the *Patriot*!â€”\n\n\"THE following Press *communique* has been issued: 'There is no truth whatever in the rumour that questions affecting the Permanent Settlement in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> are under the consideration of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>.

It cannot conceal its chagrin and mortification at the disappointment of its cherished hopes, and as a *pis aller*, it tries to discredit the *Bande Mataram* and informs our subscribers that they ought not to support us any longer because it has been proved that we are either guilty of having put forward a false defence or of the unpardonable immorality of having an editorial staff instead of a single Editor. The tone and method of this attack are worthy of this unctuous and mealy-mouthed Pecksniff of Anglo-Indian journalism. It unscrupulously supports its malicious insinuations by calling the witnesses summoned by the prosecution \"defence witnesses\" as if the accused had put men into the witness-box to tell a false story: and it shelters itself from the charge of libel by the use of 'if's and 'or's. Yet it has the impudence to claim a superior sense of honour for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> pamphleteers and editors! \"The great English political writers\", it says, \"have never been afraid to own their handiwork and we cannot recall a single instance<span class='page-number' id='s-692' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.692]</span> in which an English pamphleteer or Editor has endeavoured to evade the law by raising technical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> as to his share of responsibility.\" There are three separate insinuations in this carefully written sentence; first, it is hinted that Srijut Aurobindo Ghose was the real writer of the correspondence, \"Politics for Indians\", but falsely denied his handiwork; secondly that he was the responsible Editor of the paper and his denial of responsibility was \"technical\" and untrue; thirdly, that any writer for the paper was morally bound to accept responsibility for anything that might appear in the paper as a part of the political propaganda in which he was engaged and Aurobindo Ghose, knowing himself to be so bound, evaded his responsibility out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>. Certainly the writer of this article need not disown his handiwork or evade his responsibility, for he has brought the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of safe slander to its utmost possible perfection.\n\nWe have no hesitation in saying that if we had invented a system of divided responsibility with the object of baffling a possible bureaucratic prosecution, we should have been entirely within our rights.

To allow the voice of Nationalism to be silenced would be to play into the hands of the adversary to whom we owe no duty. The gospel of National ism has to be preached with unflinching candour, but Nationalist organs will be perfectly within their rights if they protect their writers so long as it is humanly possible to protect them and so prolong their own career of propagandist usefulness.\n\nNo such arrangement was made in the case of the *Bande Mataram*. Had we intended to protect ourselves, we would have done it by the simple and convenient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japanese</span> device of a jail editor. The device imputed to us would be neither illegal nor immoral, but it would be cumbrous and unsafe. It is perfectly true that it throws great difficulties in the way of the prosecution, but it is equally obvious that it leaves the bureaucracy free to single out anyone they choose for harassment and does not protect him at all, since the police have only to be clever enough in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of witnesses and the arrangement of the evidence, and the accused, whether really responsible or not, is doomed. Everybody can feel that if Anukul <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mukherji</span> had had more backbone and lied more cleverly in the cross-examination, Srijut Aurobindo Ghose would now be a convict in the Central Jail. Had we thought of putting forward a false defence, we could have done it very effectively by producing an Editor on the spot. There were at least three men on the staff who were anxious to immolate themselves in this manner, and it was only<span class='page-number' id='s-694' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.694]</span> prevented by the refusal of the accused to accept any such sacrifice and by the singular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the prosecution in calling the officers of the Company as their witnesses. The moment Srijut Sailendranath Ghose entered the witness box, there was no course left open to the defence but to take their stand on the facts as elicited by the prosecution. For a member of the staff to come forward and by a splendid falsehood take upon himself the responsibility of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> complained of, if not of the whole editorial function, would have been morally permissible; but it was obviously impossible for the Secretary of the Company to perjure himself by fixing a non-existent responsibility on any particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>. The one defect in the conduct of the defence was that the circumstances which brought about the state of things described by the Secretary, were not elicited in cross-examination. When we come to deal with the facts of the case in detail, we shall mend that deficiency and our readers will see that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of that arrangement was natural and even inevitable.\n\nIn the diatribe of the Chowringhee Pecksniff against us there is one bit of Pecksniffian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> which we fail to appreciate. He seems to think that a paper cannot be respectable unless it has a single autocratic Editor and that the readers of a paper not so blessed must be disreputable. Why, pray? We had always thought that what one man could do in the way of management, could be done as well by a board or committee of men acting in unison and with one clearly understood policy; we used even to think that such conjoint management was in politics the characteristic of democratic times. But Chowringhee liberalism evidently thinks no arrangement respectable which does not involve absolute control by a single master-mind. It argues that the *Bande Mataram* policy being the joint product of several minds must be the result of distracted counsels, since only an autocrat can think clearly. After that we can hardly be surprised at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> of the Friend of India for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> and absolutist methods or the support it has given to the new Grand Mogul who now governs India on mediaeval principles from Westminster.<span class='page-number' id='s-695' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.695]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-chowringhee-pecksniff-and-ourselves","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Statesman in Retreat","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-statesman-in-retreat","prvt":"Pioneer or Hindu Patriot?","prvu":"/cwsa/07/pioneer-or-hindu-patriot","dt":"1907-09-26","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-statesman-in-retreat"],"t":"The Statesman in Retreat","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The strong censures which the *Statesman*'s article on the *Bande Mataram* case has called forth from the Bengali Press in Calcutta, have forced that journal to enter into some explanation of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>. While professing to stand by every word it had written, it manages under cover of the plea that it has been misunderstood, to unsay much that it had said. The article was on the face of it a malignant attack on the *Bande Mataram*, an attempt to create the impression that this paper was either a journal managed on a dishonest, disreputable and impossible principle or else that its staff were a gang of liars and cowards with an Editor who made a false or practically false defence in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to avoid the responsibility for his political propaganda. We were told that from this dilemma there was no possible escape. The *Statesman* has now considerably altered its tone. In order that we may not be accused of wilfully misinterpreting our very Liberal contemporary, we will give his explanation of his own meaning in his own words and answer him point by point. \"We maintained\", he says, \"that there had been in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> a miscarriage of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> in the *Bande Mataram* case, since the trial had resulted in the conviction of the Printer, whereas the real offenderâ€”the author of the article or articles complained ofâ€”was not brought to book. We pointed out in the next place, that in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> the person really responsible for the articles could readily have been found, for no attempt would have been made to evade the issue on the divided liability principle adopted in the *Bande Mataram* office, still less to make a scapegoat of an ignorant workman. We maintained lastly that unless every public journal had a responsible head of some sort, the liberty of the<span class='page-number' id='s-696' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.696]</span> Press would degenerate into a licence under which no institution of organised society, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>'s reputation would be safe.\"\n\nWe do not for a moment deny that there was a very serious miscarriage of justice in the *Bande Mataram* case, but we are certainly astonished at the malignity of the *Statesman* in trying to fasten the responsibility for the Printer's conviction on the *Bande Mataram* or on the other accused. It writes as if it were we who took out a warrant against the Printer, knowing him to be nothing but an ignorant workman, or who sentenced him to three months' rigorous imprisonment in spite of the evidence that he knew nothing of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> and could not have had any criminal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> or intention, or as if we had asked the Printer to take any responsibility upon himself for the articles. Does the Friend of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> find anywhere in the records of the case or out of them either that any of the accused tried to shield himself by putting the responsibility on the Printer? The blame for the miscarriage of justice must rest on the unjust British law which makes an ignorant workman responsible, on the bureaucrats who sanctioned his prosecution and on the Magistrate who sentenced him, and the attempt to fasten it on our shoulders is as grotesque as it is malicious. The *Statesman* is, farther, much exercised because the real author of the offending article has escaped punishment, but this is not a calamity over which we can affect to be greatly grieved. After <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, miscarriages of justice, whether in the shape of the conviction of innocent Indians or the immunity from punishment of European criminals, are not so rare in this country that society will be shattered to pieces because the writer of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> letter disagreeable to the sacred <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of the bureaucracy has not been sent to turn the oil-mill for a couple of years. \"In England the person really responsible for the article could readily have been found.\" If the real writer is meant, we deny this altogether. In England it would be absolutely impossible to discover the true writer of an unsigned article, for it is not considered binding on him to come forward even if another suffers for his offence or his indiscretion; and when the *Statesman* claims a chivalrous sense of honour for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> writers political or other and asserts that they always come forward<span class='page-number' id='s-697' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.697]</span> to claim their handiwork it is trading on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> which is prevalent in this country. If, on the other hand, the Editor is meant, we would advise our contemporary to study the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the English Press more minutely. He will find that English editors have not always been so enamoured of legal penalties as to forego any opportunity of evading responsibility which the law allowed them. We will admit that ordinarily in England there is a single responsible head of some kind, though he is not always the writer of the articles, but this is not the case in every country nor with every newspaper, and we cannot admit that any such arrangement is necessary in the interests of society. When the *Statesman* says that no man's reputation is safe unless every paper has its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> responsible head, it is talking and knows that it is talking pure nonsense. A man who thinks himself libelled has always his remedy in civil law and it cannot matter to him whether he gets his damages from the actual writer of the libellous matter or from the proprietor or from a company or syndicate owning the paper. Was Mr. Lever's reputation unsafe because his damages were paid by the Harmsworth Trust and not by the actual libeller? If the proprietor happens to be a corporate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, the aggrieved person is no doubt deprived of the vindictive pleasure of sending his critic to prison, but we hardly think it can be said that society is mortally wounded by his loss. But of course what the *Statesman* is really troubled about is the safety of the bureaucratic groups who administer the country at present and whom it dignifies and disguises by describing as \"institutions of organised society\". This anxiety of the *Statesman*'s is rather humorous. The bureaucracy has armed itself with such liberal powers of repression that a journalist attacking it is like a man with no better weapon than a pebble assailing a Goliath panoplied from head to foot, armed with a repeating rifle and supported by howitzers and maxim guns. For a backer of the giant to complain because the unarmed assailant throws his pebble from behind a bush or wall is, to say the least of it, a trifle incongruous.\n\nThe gravamen of the *Statesman*'s charge, however, lies in the question it triumphantly posits at the end of its rejoinder as<span class='page-number' id='s-698' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.698]</span> a final settler for its critics. The impugned \"articles in the *Bande Mataram* must have been written by someone; is it courageous and honourable conduct on the part of their unknown author, this precious 'patriot', that he should elect to remain in hiding and let a poor unfortunate Printer go to jail in place of himself?\" And our contemporary asks its critics either to affirm that it is right for a journalist to allow an innocent man to suffer in his place,â€”or else be silent. We admit our contemporary's luminous suggestion that someone must have written the article \"Politics for Indians\" and the better to clear up the confusion of his ideas we will add that the someone must have been either a member of the staff or an outside correspondent. The evidence showed that he must have been the latter, and, if so, his conduct in not coming forward was in accordance with those traditions of English journalism by which the *Statesman* sets such store. It may not have been ethically the most heroic or exalted conduct possible, but it does not lie in the mouth of an Englishman to question it. And we presume that the *Statesman* will not seriously suggest that it was our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>, even if we had recorded the name, to peach against a correspondent in order to save our own man, or that such a betrayal would have been either courageous or honourable. If, on the other hand, the real writer were a journalist on the staff, he must have been someone other than Aurobindo <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> to whom no one in his senses would attribute such a half-baked effusion. He would then be one who was not accused and could only take the responsibility by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> evidence against himself as a witness for the defence. No Englishman in a similar situation would have done it unless actually put in the witness box, but for an Indian patriot, we admit, it would have been the natural course if the Printer could have been saved by his self-devotion but it is perfectly obvious that the Printer would still have been liable under the statute and got his three months.

We are farther told by our contemporary that the moment the peace was broken, the budmash element asserted itself.

The first is that if the present bureaucratic government were to be, let us not say \"overthrown\" but to be driven to retire in dudgeon from the scene, the Arms Act would deal with them and the people would very soon have the means as well as the will to defend themselves. The second is that the police in a free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> would be compelled to protect the citizens instead of supplementing the deficiencies of the hooligans.

For the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> are a great and wonderful people.

England had two sides, and the one which dazzled men was very bright. And now all the world is watching what England will do now that the same problem is once more set for her which every nation has failed to solve, whether she will tread the same path of futile bloodshed, violence and defiance of irresistible decrees which other nations have trod before her or be wise in her generation as she was wise when her own children rose against her in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Canada</span>, as she has once more been wise after her hour of blood-thirst and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span> in the Transvaal.

Still her rulers have qualms, hesitations, fears, still they dare not utterly set their own law and the law of God at defiance. At the last moment a palsy overtakes their hands, a relenting works in their souls. After their long torture the Rawalpindi prisoners are free; Nibaran has hardly escaped from the gallows by a strange mercy of Fate; here and there the monotonous roll of repression is brightened by occasional acquittals, by stray glimpses of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> if not of forbearance. But the Anglo-Indian bureaucrats have set out on the slippery path where futile ferocity and vain blood guiltiness hurry down the car of empire to sink in the sea of shame and blood below. Seldom and by a miracle can the wheels that have once gone some way down by that slope be retarded and stopped.\n\nWhat is it that you seek, rulers who are eager to confuse the interests of a handful of white administrators with the welfare of humanity, or what is it that you dream, traders who think that God made this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> of ours only as a market for your merchandise?

But do you think that therefore God has utterly abandoned us and given us up for ever to be a mere convenience for the West, the helots of its commerce, and the feeders of its luxury and pride? We are still God's chosen people and all our calamities have been but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> of suffering, because for the great mission before us prosperity was not sufficient, adversity had also its training; to taste the glory of power and beneficence and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> was not sufficient, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of weakness and torture and humiliation was also needed; it was not enough that we should be able to fill the role of the merciful sage and the beneficent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>king</span>, we had also to experience in our own persons the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of the outcaste and the slave. But now that lesson is learned, and the time for our resurgence is come. And no power shall stay that uprising and no opposing interest shall deny us the right to live, to be ourselves, to set our seal once more upon the world. Every race and people that oppressed us even in our evening and our midnight has been broken into pieces and their glory turned into a legend of the past. Yet you venture to hope that in the hour of our morning you will be able to draw back the veil of night once more over our land as if to read you a lesson. God has lighted the fire in a quarter where you least feared it and it is beginning to eat up your commerce and threaten your ease. He has raised up the people you despised as weaklings and cowards, a people of clerks and babblers and slaves and set you to break their insurgent spirit and trample them into the dust if you can. And you cannot. You have tried every means except <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> massacre and you have failed. And now what will you do? Will you learn the lesson before it is too late or will you sink your Empire in the mire of shame where other nations have gone who had not the excuse of the knowledge of liberty and the teachings of the past? For us, for you, today everything is trembling in the balance, and it is not for us who have but reacted passively to your action, it is for you to decide.<span class='page-number' id='s-708' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.708]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-vanity-of-reaction","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Price of a Friend","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-price-of-a-friend","prvt":"\"Armenian Horrors\"","prvu":"/cwsa/07/armenian-horrors","dt":"1907-10-07","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-price-of-a-friend"],"t":"The Price of a Friend","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Recent events are daily putting a greater and greater strain on the sweet and cordial relation of the Friend of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> with her people. It is no doubt hard to part when friends are dear, perhaps it will cost a sigh, a tear. Under the circumstances the poet's advice is to steal away and choose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>'s own time.

The Friend so fondly hoped that the Moderates compared with whom the Extremists are \"a mere drop in the ocean\" would ever remain docile and teachable, sit at its feet for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> time and hang on its lips with the attention and reverence they show to their spiritual preceptors. But this sudden change in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> has come to our friend as a surprise. The Moderates are now most indecently and openly hobnobbing with the Extremists. When a prominent Extremist goes to jail the Moderates stand by him, nay shed tears over his unjust incarceration. When an Extremist newspaper is prosecuted and the bureaucracy fails to spot the real offender on account of its having been conducted under an arrangement which, whatever its merit, lacks the fairness and candour of delivering the management at once into the hands of the enemy whenever so required, the Moderates do not realise the enormity of the latter's offence and what is more resent the Friend of India's pious demand that the conductors of the paper should have thrust their neck down the wolf's throat. This ill-advised obstinacy the friend can hardly excuse and we quite understand its righteous indignation. There is time yet for the Moderates to come round, go on their knees before their justly offended friend and sign a pledge to go back to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. This the friend demands and hopes that the Moderates will accede to it. The friend also reaffirms his claim to their allegiance and that is his persistent support of their \"just aspirations\". It is by<span class='page-number' id='s-709' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.709]</span> their unjust aspirations that they have forfeited the sympathy of this precious friend.

Whoever wants to alter this most reasonable and fair arrangement must be shunned and expelled from the Congress and all other institutions which desire the countenance of the *Statesman*. The friend also contends that though the constitutional method has not hitherto paid, that does not mean that it will never pay.

In badly-governed countries like Russia, Turkey and India, the line of demarcation is very small between the police and the habitual criminal, the *budmash*, the hooligan whom it is their nominal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to repress. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of pampering the police so that they may be the faithful instruments of a small, unpopular and insecure ruling class in coercing and breaking the spirit of the great mass of the people, inevitably removes all moral restraint, the ever-present sense of duty, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of punishment and the abiding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> of being servants and not masters of the people, which can alone prevent such dangerous though necessary powers as those wielded by the police from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> a curse instead of a protection to society. The almost universal habit of unpunished extortion and corruption, the free indulgence in insolence and brutality which are the hallmark of a serviceable Indian police, are not peculiar to them, but common to all despotically governed countries. Such a police naturally become the patrons and protectors of the *budmash* element.<span class='page-number' id='s-712' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.712]</span> They keep it in control and punish individuals so far as suits their own purposes, so far, that is to say, as is necessary to keep the hooligan in terror and make him feel that the police is his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> but if the hooligan is subservient and willing to pay for impunity, the police will wink at his anti-social pursuits and his particular offences and get the innocent punished the better to screen their proteges. These are facts of such common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> in India that they hardly repay repetition except in order to drive home a truth it has taken our politicians a long time to realise,â€”that no amount of commissions and paper reforms and new methods of recruitment and readjustments of the scale of pay will destroy or even mitigate the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> which is constitutional, congenital, ingrained, in the very system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> now obtaining in India and cannot be mended or ended unless that system of government is itself mended or ended. Our present point, however, is that in countries where such relations obtain between the police and the habitual criminal, the latter can become a very useful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> in dealing with political discontent, when the police itself is unable to cope with people, or for political reasons, it is thought advisable to screen partially or wholly their use of violent and illegal means of repression, or even when diplomatic considerations make it necessary that there should be a riot or tumult so that nationalism may be discredited or an excuse provided for benevolent intervention or philanthropic annexation or the other devices to which civilized international piracy has nowadays recourse.\n\nThe most complete examples of this protected hooliganism are, of course, to be found in Russia, but the specimens occasionally produced by the Indian police are, perhaps, of a superior make and more artistic finish. A still more remarkable and successful specimen, however has been recently revealed to us in Wilfrid Blunt's remarkable book on the Secret <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>History</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> Occupation of Egypt. We shall have occasion to return upon the curious revelations made in this book as to the sinister and Machiavellian methods by which an Anglo-Indian official trained in the arts of government as practised in India, brought about the great act of piracy on the banks of the<span class='page-number' id='s-713' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.713]</span> Nile, the characteristic part played by John <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>, that honest broker of injustice and oppression, in forcing foreign domination on Egypt, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> striking lessons which the history of Nationalism in Egypt has for the new-born Nationalism in India. We confine ourselves at present to quoting the pointed remarks of historians in the *Indian Review* for September on the revelations of Wilfrid Blunt. Speaking of the riot which was made an excuse for British intervention he says:â€”\n\n\"There, it is clearly brought home to the unbiassed readers' <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> how Arabi was innocent of the premeditated Alexandrian riot, how Omar Pasha Lufte was the chief culprit, and how the gendarmerie and the police had deliberately purchased beforehand and distributed a large quantity of naboots or lathis to the lowest class of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arabs</span> and Bedouins. The evidence of unofficial and disinterested eyewitnesses has been also recorded to show that knives and bayonets which the police had supplied were the instruments by which people were killed. Ten European doctors who had examined the dead bodies at the hospital averred in their report that all the wounds were inflicted either by the lathis or the knives and the bayonets which were the arms of the police, and yet, strange to say, no proceedings had been taken against the police who took an active part in the riots, under the direct orders of the police prefect, killing many a Christian.\" Mr. Blunt proves how Arabi Pasha was entirely guiltless in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, for while the riots raged most furiously there was \"the utter absence in the streets of the soldiers of the regular troops,\" who alone were under the command of that personage. The evidence of one Mr. Hewat, an English accountant, is exceedingly corroborative. He had \"no hesitation in saying that instead of suppressing the riot,\" this police \"did all in its power to increase it and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> on the occasion was most barbarous, violent and fanatical.\" And there is the personal testimony of so eminent a person of commercial reputation as the late Mr. Stephen Ralli of the great house of Ralli Brothers. \"To show the treachery of the authorities one has only to know the followingâ€”the street disturbance began at 3 o'clock, the policeman doing the most of the killing, until past 7 o'clock.\" But enough of these gruesome details.<span class='page-number' id='s-714' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.714]</span> They remind us of the part the Indian police has taken now and again in past years in promoting riots, suborning witnesses and perjuring themselves with impunity. The strangest part, however, of this deplorable affair is the persistent manner in which Earl Granville, the foreign minister, under the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> of the two men on the spot, endeavoured by hook or by crook, to fasten on Arabi Pasha the responsibility of the bloodshed caused by the riot when impartial European witnesses had testified that it was the police and the gendarmerie alone who had previously arranged for the affray and distributed staves and arms, and had actually done the butchering. Says Mr. Blunt: \"The English Government apparently only gave the idea of a preconcerted and deliberate massacre on the impossibility being forced on them of connecting Arabi with that event.\" This phase of the incident, too, is not unfamiliar to Indian people, namely, how the authorities have in the past strained every nerve to screen the actual instigators and wrong doers, namely, the police, and foist upon innocent men the origin of riots. But the dismal analogy does not end here. There is even a third <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> which also has its counterpart in the experience of Indians. Mr. Blunt remarks: \"The fact that no telegrams or messages between the Governor, Omar Lufti, and the Khedive, between the Khedive and Sir E. Malet, or between the Admiral and Sir E. Malet and the English Consulate, which must have been passing continually while the riots were proceeding, have been produced, is highly suspicious and requires explanation.\" Have not Indians, too, been highly suspicious of the absence of important telegrams in Blue-books published months after the occurrence of events by Parliament under \"responsible\" Ministers so-called? Blue-books in general never do contain letters and documents which are of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> to incriminate officials and reflect on the conduct and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> of the highest authorities themselves.\n\nThe parallel drawn so ably by historians, to which fresh point is lent by the disturbances in Calcutta, ends here. Protected hooliganism succeeded in Egypt because the circumstances were different and the Nationalism of the Egyptians at that time of a less robust and less exalted type. If it is tried in India, it cannot<span class='page-number' id='s-715' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.715]</span> succeed. The Egyptian nationalists made the mistake of trying to accomplish their ends by diplomacy, by reliance upon European support and, when that failed them, by a military struggle between their armed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and the British intruders, without first awakening the people and inspiring them with the passion for liberty which can alone give a long-subject <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> the strength to endure and survive, to thrive on disaster and overcome defeat. The work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> must be done before the work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cavour</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Garibaldi</span> can begin. In India the awakening has come, the passion for liberty is abroad, and we have the satisfaction of knowing that the fire we have kindled is unquenchable and the impetus given is one against which no human power can stand. In Egypt Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. John Morley and their allies had only to create an excuse for armed interference and to crush a feeble military resistance in order that their nefarious work might be done. But to coerce indignation and resistance of a whole people is a more difficult task than to win battles, for here it is not the engines of war, but the engines of the spirit which decide the conflict, and when the motive power on one side comes from Heaven itself while the source is merely human, the task of despotism becomes an impossibility.<span class='page-number' id='s-716' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.716]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/protected-hooliganism-a-parallel","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Mr. Keir Hardie and India","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/mr-keir-hardie-and-india","prvt":"A New Literary Departure","prvu":"/cwsa/07/a-new-literary-departure","dt":"1907-10-08","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["mr-keir-hardie-and-india"],"t":"Mr. Keir Hardie and India","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The visit of Mr. Keir Hardie to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, so much feared by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> papers, has come and gone and the reactionist Press have taken care that it should create the right sort of sensation in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> so that whatever he may tell of the carefully-hidden truth about the \"unrest\" in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> may be discredited beforehand. We have been watching these manoeuvres with some amusement, mingled with a kind of admiration for the sheer bare-faced impudence of the lies which these amiable gentry are administering so liberally to a willing British public. Anything is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> enough for British consumption, and accordingly Anglo-India sets itself no limits in the grossness and incredibility of the inventions it circulates. Mr. Hardie's presence is responsible for<span class='page-number' id='s-716' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.716]</span> the riots, for the Union Jute Mills strike, for every development of the political struggle which has occurred since the formidable Labourite set foot on Indian soil. We shall hardly be surprised if we see it next asserted in the *Englishman* and then telegraphed by the *Englishman*'s faithful Reuter that the boldness of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay's statement in the dock was caused by the expectation of Keir Hardie's visit or that some dim prophetic anticipation of it moved Basanta Bhattacharjee when he faced the terrors of British law. We are ready to give Anglo-India credit for very great lengths of denseness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and folly, but it is hard to believe that they cannot realise the change which has come over Indian political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and still think that the words or presence of an Englishman can ever again influence the minds of the people even in an ordinary way much less in the fabulous fashion which Newmania concocts. Anglo-India feared that if the truth travelled to England, the campaign of repression might be stopped and measures of conciliation adopted. For ourselves we never entertained any such <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span>. It is not ignorance of the truth, but their own self-interest as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> which determines the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> English parties, not excluding the Labourites. The interest of the monied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> is bound up with the continuance of arbitrary British domination, and for that domination Liberal as well as Tory will fight tooth and nail. As for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Labour</span> party, it will support that domination if they think it is to the interest of the working classes; otherwise they will oppose it. We have met and talked with Mr. Keir Hardie and we found him a strong, shrewd-witted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> possessed of a great deal of clear common sense. He is a Labourite and a Socialist. As a Labourite he will do whatever he thinks best in the interests of Labour; as a Socialist, the interests of whose creed are bound up with the progress of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>internationalism</span>, he may take Indian questions with a greater sincerity than the Cottons and Wedderburns. But as we said before in our article on Mr. Keir Hardie, to suppose that he can do anything for us is a delusion.

The riots in Shyambazar had a double utility, to intimidate the people into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> up the boycott and to put an end to the meetings in the public squares which bore periodical witness of the quick and continued heart-beats of the great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. The first object has not been served; on the contrary, popular exasperation has manifested itself in a more thorough-going resort to the weapon of boycott and the chances of a large sale of foreign goods, which were before the riots fairly <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, are now, we believe, nil. The police and their *goondas* failed also to intimidate the student and middle-class population of Calcutta who showed a far more sustained courage than an ordinary European mob would have shown if placed at a similar disadvantage. But although the riots have not frightened the people of Calcutta into cessation from public meetings, they have afforded an excuse for taking advantage of the unlimited and irresponsible powers provided for the coercion of the people by an alien-made law. In so far they have served their end. Meetings have been prohibited in Calcutta in any public place, and the bureaucrats no doubt hope that this will cripple the boycott and spoil the celebration of the Partition day. Such is the wisdom of bureaucrats! The obvious answer to this proclamation is to celebrate the rites of Partition day with greater solemnity than ever, to meet in large private courts and compounds, instead of the public squares, to take organized and stringent measures for the social boycott of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> who take a scrap of British goods in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and for the leaders to denounce and end any kind of co-operation with or recognition of the<span class='page-number' id='s-718' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.718]</span> bureaucrats who are responsible for these continued outrages on public sentiment. We look to see this done and if the leaders are not ready to do it, it is for the people to make their voice heard in that sense with no uncertain utterance. It is useless to go on glossing over the issue; the time has come when it should be clearly recognised that any act of compromise with the bureaucrats in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> is an act of treason to the people and their aspirations.

They had a Nationalist majority in the Executive Committee and the Moderates were arranging for a fresh meeting of the Reception Committee to alter this state of things. This unconstitutional step led to the subsequent unpleasant development. It is very difficult to disentangle the truth from the apparently exaggerated reports of \"Nationalist rowdyism\" of which so much has been heard of late. But we have a suspicion that it is the wonted game of the Moderates to have it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> their own way and then to try to discredit the opponents by making them responsible to the country for the disunion and dissension in the camp. Why do they not adopt a straightforward course from the very beginning? It is they who stand in the way of a united <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> by denying a fair representation to those who hold advanced political views. They always want the Nationalists to compromise their principle by an appeal in the name of unity. But their selfishness and autocracy never allow them to reflect on the true way of achieving unity.\n\nThere is a cant phrase which is always on our lips in season and out of season, and it is the cry for unity. We <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> it a cant phrase because those who use it, have not the slightest conception of what they mean when they use it, but simply employ it as an effective formula to discourage independence<span class='page-number' id='s-720' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.720]</span> in thought and progressiveness in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. It is not the reality of united thought and action which they desire, it is merely the appearance of unity. \"Do not let the Englishman think we are not entirely at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> on any and every question,\" that is the bottom idea underlying this formula. It is a habit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> born of the spirit of dependence and weakness. It is a fosterer of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>falsehood</span> and encourages cowardice and insincerity. \"Be your views what they may, suppress them, for they will spoil our unity; swallow your principles, they will spoil our unity; do not battle for what you think to be the right, it will spoil our unity; leave necessary things undone, for the attempt to do them will spoil our unity\"; this is the cry. The prevalence of a dead and lifeless unity is the true index of national degradation, quite as much as the prevalence of a living unity is the index of national greatness. So long as India was asleep and only talking in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>, a show of unity was possible, but the moment it awoke and began to live, this show was bound to be broken. So long as mendicancy was our method and ideal, the show was necessary, for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span> of beggars must not vary in its statements or in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of its request to the prospective patron; they must cringe and whine in a single key. Under other circumstances, the maintenance of the show becomes of less paramount importance.\n\nThere is another idea underlying the cry for unity and it is the utterly erroneous impression that nations have never been able to liberate themselves and do great deeds unless they were entirely and flawlessly united within. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>History</span> supplies no justification for this specious theory. On the contrary when a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> is living at high pressure and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> are at white <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> and actions are bound to diverge far more strongly than at other times. In the strenuous times before the American War of Independence, the colony was divided into a powerful minority who were wholly for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>, a great hesitating majority who were eager for internal autonomy but unwilling to use extreme methods, and a small but vigorous minority of extremists with men like John Adams at their head who pushed the country into revolt and created a nation. The history of the Italian revolution tells the same story. We are fond of quoting the instance of<span class='page-number' id='s-721' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.721]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span>, pointing to its magnificent unity and crying shame on ourselves for falling below that glorious standard; but those of us who talk most of Japan often betray a sovereign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of its history. Nowhere was there a more keen, determined and murderous struggle between parties than in Japan in the days of its preparation, and the struggle was not over the ultimate ideal or objectâ€”the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and greatness of Japan, on which all parties were agreedâ€”but on questions of method and internal organisation. Until that question as between the moderate Shogun party and the extremist Mikado party had been settled, it was felt by all that the approach to the ultimate ideal of all could not be seriously attempted.\n\nTrue national unity is the unity of self-dedication to the country when the liberty and greatness of our motherland is the paramount consideration to which all others must be subordinated. In India at the present hour there are three conflicting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>; one party sets the maintenance of British supremacy above all other considerations; another would maintain that supremacy in a modified form; a third aspires to make India a free and autonomous nation, connected with England, if it may be, but not dependent on her. Until one of these conflicting ideals is accepted by the majority of the nation, it is idle to make a show of unity. That was possible formerly because the ideal of a modified British supremacy was the prevailing ideal, but now that new hopes and resolves are entering the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>, these must either be crushed or prevail, before true unity of a regenerated nation can replace the false unity of acquiescence in servitude.<span class='page-number' id='s-722' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.722]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-nagpur-affair-and-true-unity","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Nagpur Imbroglio","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-nagpur-imbroglio","prvt":"The Shadow of the Ordinance in Calcutta","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-shadow-of-the-ordinance-in-calcutta","dt":"1907-10-23","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-nagpur-imbroglio"],"t":"The Nagpur Imbroglio","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"It is difficult to get authentic and undisputed news of the Nagpur imbroglio, but if report is to be believed, there is a better <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> than before of a satisfactory working compromise. It is in every way desirable that the present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> should be smoothed over if that can be done without any sacrifice of essential principle, and for any such compromise it is essential for both sides to recognise that while they may and should fight stubbornly for their principles both outside and inside the Congress, yet the National Assembly itself is not the monopoly of either. A great deal of clamour has been raised by the Moderates of Nagpur and Bombay over the outbursts of excited popular feeling in which a few Loyalists were roughly handled, and use has been freely made of them to obscure the real issue. It is well therefore that this incident, which we must <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> regret, should be understood in its true light. The Moderate majority on the Nagpur Reception Committee happens to be a factitious majority and most of the members take no sustained interest in the Committee work while the Nationalist minority are alert and active. At the meeting which elected the Executive Committee the Moderates did not attend except in small <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and a strong Nationalist majority was elected. The inconveniences of this tactical defeat were very soon felt by the Moderate party and after a fashion to which they are unfortunately too much addicted, they tried to remedy their original error by riding roughshod over procedure and the unwritten law that guides the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of all public bodies. Mr. Chitnavis, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the Secretaries, called on his own initiative a fresh meeting to elect a new Executive in which the Moderates should predominate. Dr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Munje</span>, also a Secretary, was perfectly<span class='page-number' id='s-723' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.723]</span> within his rights in opposing the bare-faced illegality of this unconstitutional procedure and refusing to allow the meeting to be held. Meanwhile great popular excitement had been created and there was a strong feeling of indignation among the students and people in general against the Moderate aristocrats of Nagpur and when they issued from the abortive meeting, they were angrily received by the crowd waiting outside and handled in a very rough and unseemly manner. This was certainly regrettable, but it is absurd to make the Nationalist leaders in Nagpur responsible for the outburst. All that they did was to baffle a very discreditable attempt to defy all constitutional procedure and public decorum in the interests of party trickery, and in doing so they were entirely right.\n\nA persistent attempt has also been made to prejudice the Nagpur Nationalists in the eyes of the country and obscure the real question by grossly misrepresenting their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> with regard to the issue about the Presidentship. By the rule formulated at last year's Congressâ€”a rule we have always considered foolish and unworkableâ€”the local Reception Committee has to elect the President for the year by a three-fourths majority, and, if they cannot do so, the decision rests with the All-India Congress Committee. This arrangement is admirably conceived for swelling the Congress funds on the one hand and for defeating public opinion on the other. The Reception Committee is not an elected or representative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> but is constituted on a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> basis, as anyone who can pay twenty-five rupees or get another to pay it for him can have his name enrolled as a member. Whichever side has the longer purse can secure the election of the President of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>. Such an election is no more likely to represent public opinion than Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s Council of Notables is likely to represent it. Like the Council of Notables it will represent the opinion of the monied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span>, the men of position and purse, the men \"with a stake in the country\". Nevertheless the rule is there and so long as it stands, it must be observed. The position in Nagpur as in the Deccan is this, that the Loyalist Moderate party is composed of the wealthy, successful and high-placed men, the retired officials, the Rai Sahebs<span class='page-number' id='s-724' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.724]</span> and Rai Bahadurs, the comfortable professional men and those who pride themselves on their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and Western enlightenment and look down with contempt on the ignorant masses. On the other hand the young men and the poorer middle class form the bulk of the Nationalist party, although it contains a minority of the wealthier men. The lines of divergence are therefore somewhat different from those in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> and the gulf between the two parties wider both in opinion and in spirit. In Bombay or Nagpur it would be perfectly impossible for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> like Sj. Surendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Banerji</span> to be a leader of the Moderates; he would be looked on with suspicion, continually checked, snubbed, thrust into the shadow and eventually forced out of the camp.\n\nThe struggle over the Presidentship in Nagpur followed lines necessitated by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the two parties. The Moderates relied on the length of their purse, the Nationalists appealed to the people. A few Moderates of wealth advanced money and filled the Reception Committee with men of their persuasion, who were therefore in a sense paid to vote for any President proposed by their wealthy patrons. The Nationalists on the other hand created a Nationalist organisation or Rashtriya Mandali and invited all who were willing to become members of the Reception Committee *on condition that Mr. Tilak became President* to send in the requisite sum, not to the Reception Committee but to the Rashtriya Mandali. Eventually it was found that though the total sum raised by the Nationalists was much larger than that contributed by the Moderate magnates, yet the votes it represented fell short of three-fourths. It was decided, therefore, after paying in the sums sent in unconditionally to the Congress funds, to devote the rest to some Nationalist purpose, preferably the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of a National School in Nagpur. This decision has been deliberately misrepresented as a perversion of Congress funds and a refusal on the part of the Nationalist party to contribute their share of the Congress expenses. The money was expressly sent in on the condition and with the proviso that the contributors would become members of the Reception Committee *only* if there was a certainty of Mr. Tilak's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span><span class='page-number' id='s-725' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.725]</span> elected, and for this reason it was sent in to the Rashtriya Mandali and not to the Congress Committee as the latter could not accept conditional contributions. In the disposal of these monies therefore, Mr. Tilak not having been elected, the Congress has no concern whatever and the Moderate party less than none; it is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> entirely between the Nationalist organisation and its contributors. Yet it is on these and similarly flimsy pretexts that the Moderate magnates have withdrawn from the Reception Committee.\n\nA compromise can now be arrived at only on condition that the present constitution of the Executive Committee is not interfered with and that the Congress session will be duly held at Nagpur. To transfer the Congress to Madras or any other centre for the convenience of the Moderate party while there are men willing to hold it in Nagpur would mean a definite and final split in the Congress camp which would turn the Congress into a Rump of Loyalists and Moderates possibly with a Nationalist Assembly standing in opposition to it. The All-India Committee is not likely to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> on such an undesirable consummation. Whoever may or may not retire himself from the Reception Committee, the body itself remains and is the only one constitutionally capable of holding the session this year. On the other hand the rule of the three-fourths majority remains and if Mr. Tilak's followers cannot secure this for their nominee, the Nationalists cannot lower themselves by attempting to secure his election by any unfair or unconstitutional means. They may also meet the Moderates halfway by raising further funds as their share of the Congress expenditure. If Mr. Tilak is not elected, it does not matter to us, in the absence of Lala Lajpat Rai, whether Dr. Rash Behari <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> or any other figurehead graces the Presidential seat, and this need not be a cause of further quarrel. On the basis of Dr. Ghose's election and the *status quo* in other respects a compromise ought not to be impossible, and at the present juncture it is undoubtedly desirable. We hope that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> sense and not party feeling will prevail.<span class='page-number' id='s-726' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.726]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-nagpur-imbroglio","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"English Democracy Shown Up","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/english-democracy-shown-up","prvt":"The Nagpur Affair and True Unity","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-nagpur-affair-and-true-unity","dt":"1907-10-29","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["english-democracy-shown-up"],"t":"English Democracy Shown Up","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Scratch an Englishman and you will find an Anglo-Indian,â€”this is what we said in these columns sometime ago.

We must not commit the mistake of supposing that the English Press is indignant because it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span> the truth of Mr. Hardie's statements against the Indian Government; not that at all; they know very well, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> and all of that yelling throng, that every word of what he has said is true, and that Reuter has wired a grossly mendacious version of his statements; but they are full of wrath because the leader of the Independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Labour</span> Party has told the unvarnished truth respecting the character of the rule that England has established here.

He is no longer a statesman because he could not deliberately suppress a truth in consideration of the reasons of state, which in the present instance means, in the interest of the sickening British lieâ€”repeated *ad nauseam* before Europe and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span>â€”that England governs India for the benefit of the Indians. The paper which so often contains articles from the pen of Sir Henry Cotton joins in this infamous chorus of denunciation no less than the *Daily News* which always so overflows with the pure milk of undiluted Liberalism, that is to say British Liberalism.\n\nLet us hope this at least will serve to open wide the eyes of those of our countrymen who are still troubled now and then with the visitings of their old faith in England.

If an Englishman with a disengaged mind has the courage to take up our cause, and tell the world the most elementary facts about the wrong England is doing us, his voice is drowned in the roar of the ruling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> whose one aim is mercilessly to exploit India and let the rest of the world know as little about their real Indian policy as possible, and even to deceive it whenever opportunity offers.

That grandiose declaration was not without its effect in the international world, though we know only too well that the Transvaal Indians live under infinitely more humiliating conditions now than they ever did under the Government of Paul Kruger. And one need not feel surprised if one hears an Englishman, even at the present day, repeating the pronouncement of Lord Lansdowne in all solemnity in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to prove England's constant anxiety and watchfulness on behalf of her Indian subjects.\n\nThere can hardly be any doubt that the Press has been shamelessly encouraged in its campaign of foul misrepresentation against Mr. Keir Hardie by Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s speech at Arbroath.

For we learn from Reuter, that \"he paid a tribute to the courage, patience and fidelity of the House of Commons, from which he augured that the democracies were going to show their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to tackle difficult and complicated problems.\" The one remarkable feature of European democracies from the days of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Athens</span> to those of England, has throughout been that whilst they always most jealously keep vigil over the integrity of their own republican constitution, they revel at the same time in the despotic sway of unlimited power over the peoples they conquer. This is strictly true of the Pagan republics of Hellas and Rome as well as of the Christian communes and country-states of Mediaeval and Modern Europe. The ideal that has shaped the polity of Europe is always consciously or unconsciously Hellenic and not Hebraic; the Christian ideal of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span> the European is apt to regard as part of the privilege of his citizenship, is not to be extended to a conquered people. This is strictly true, the Christian missions and missionaries of Europe notwithstanding. In other words Christian Europe flings her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span> aside in her treatment of those who have had the misfortune to come under her rule; these she looks upon as Athens and Rome did on their subject peoples. Mr. Morley whilst congratulating the English <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> on the determination they have shown to keep their Indian Empire their own, might very well have been feeling the secret glow of an historic enthusiasm in insensibly thinking of similar figures in ancient and modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span></span> extolling their countrymen on similar occasions.\n\nWhat we meant by taxing him with want of historic perception was that he has betrayed a sad <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of Asiatic history. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span> has never embraced an ideal without universalising it. To profess the Christian faith and persist in confining the Christian ideal of human brotherhood to one's own nation strikes the Asiatic as a monstrous hypocrisy. Nor, as we have had occasion<span class='page-number' id='s-730' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.730]</span> to remark before, has an ideal had to win its way to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the Orient through a welter of its martyrs' blood, as has been the case with all kinds of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> in Europe. This is the secret of the willingness and readiness with which the monarchies of Asia are democratising the constitutions of their country. The period of English History dating from 1066 and ending with 1832, the Shah of Persia has had the magnanimity to summarise into a few years of Persian History. It is therefore that the average Indian who has studied England's history and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> feels so extremely perplexed, and is just now beginning to feel indignant at her strenuous and persistent refusal to give India that liberty which she has so prized all through her history.\n\nEngland, on the other hand, and quite consistently enough, thinks she is rightly acting in withholding from the Indian the citizenship of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span>, for in so doing she is strictly in the wake of European tradition, and has the full justification of history as she has known and understood it. And consequently John Morley hastens to remind Indians of the \"weary steps\" necessary before they can attain liberty, the weary steps that the countries of Europe have had to traverse before they secured it.\n\nWe fully understand the import of the latest speech of the Indian Secretary, and of the latest outburst of the British democracyâ€”India will only have liberty when she has the strength, physical and moral, to wrench it from the selfish grasp of the ruling country.<span class='page-number' id='s-731' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.731]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/english-democracy-shown-up","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Difficulties at Nagpur","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/difficulties-at-nagpur","prvt":"The Nagpur Imbroglio","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-nagpur-imbroglio","dt":"1907-10-31","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["difficulties-at-nagpur"],"t":"Difficulties at Nagpur","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> experienced at Nagpur in bringing about the compromise which at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> time seemed on the point of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> effected, do not strike a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> outside the whirlpool of local excitement and controversy as either obvious or insurmountable; yet it is evident that so much importance is being attached to them as to seriously imperil the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of a Congress session being held at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> this year. It is imperative that some decision should be arrived at in the course of the next few days either one way or the other. Both sides lay the blame of the failure to arrive at an agreement on its opponents. The Nationalists say that the Moderate party will not accept any reasonable terms and the Moderates charge the Nationalists with backing out of the compromise on the question of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> subscribed to the Rashtriya Mandali. It appears that the Nationalists are willing to co-operate if Srijut Surendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Banerji</span> be nominated as President in lieu of Mr. Tilak. The reasons for this proposal and its rejection are not far to seek. Sj. Surendranath is recognised all over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> as the acknowledged leader of one of the two great parties in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> with a great name and a great following in the country and, what is more important from the Nationalist standpoint, one who, whatever vagaries his ideas of policy may lead him into, is believed to be a thorough-going Boycotter and Swadeshist and in no sense a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> man. Dr. Rash Behari <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> on the other hand is a dark horse in politics. All that the rest of India knows of him is that he is a distinguished jurist, the Chairman of last year's Reception Committee andâ€”a Legislative Councillor. None of these titles to distinction is sufficient to justify his being suddenly put forward as President<span class='page-number' id='s-732' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.732]</span> of the National Congress; for the time has passed away, not to return, when appointment to the Legislative Councils, provincial or imperial, was sufficient to raise a successful man of intellectual distinction or social influence not before politically notable, to the position of a leader or at least a sort of Congress grandee entitled to the respect of the common herd. A seat on the Legislative Council is nowadays an obstacle and not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to leadership, a cause of distrust and not of trust: the man to whom the bureaucracy lends ear is not one whom the people can trust and follow, and one who consents to sit in a Council where he is not listened to and can command no influence, has not the self-respect and backbone which are necessary to a popular leaderâ€”in days of stress and struggle. To us Nationalists a seat on the Council is not merely an obstacle but an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> bar to popular leadership, for it means that the man has one foot in the enemy's camp and one in the people's. It is easy to understand therefore why the Nagpur Nationalists are opposed to the idea of Dr. Ghose's Presidentship, specially as his political views are not understood nor has he, like Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span>, a record of past services and self-sacrifice to set against the disqualification of a seat on the Legislative Council. Nor is it difficult to understand why the Moderates of Nagpur have shied at the idea of Srijut Surendranath's Presidentship. The Moderatism of Western India is much more Loyalist than Moderate, unlike that of Bengal, where except in the case of a small minority Moderatism wears <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> more or less loosely as a sort of cloak or garment of respectability than as an essential part of its politics. This tendency is exaggerated in places like the Central Provinces where before the Nationalist upheaval the pulse of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> beat dull and slow. For a Moderate of the Nagpur Rai Bahadur type to be asked to take Surendranath as a substitute for Tilak is as if they were asked to exchange Satan for Beelzebub; both are to them, as to the *Englishman*, devils of Extremism, one only less objectionable than the other.\n\nBut the rights of this question are so simple that there is no excuse for allowing the Congress to break up over it. If the Moderates want Dr. Rash Behari Ghose or any other Loyalist or<span class='page-number' id='s-733' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.733]</span> Legislative Councillor as President they must be satisfied with their three-fourths majority on the Reception Committee and pay the bulk of the expenses of the session. If they desire a larger co-operation on the part of the Nationalists, they should meet them halfway by accepting the nomination of Surendranath or any other President acceptable to both parties as a compromise. And if they will take neither course, they should leave it to the Nationalists to arrange for the holding of the Congress with Mr. Tilak as President. But for them to insist on the Rashtriya Mandali funds, raised on the clear understanding that they should only be devoted to Congress purposes if Mr. Tilak were nominated President, being given into their hands to hold a Congress with a Loyalist President in the chair is a preposterously childish and unreasoning obstinacy. We cannot understand how the Rashtriya Mandali could take this step even if they wished, since it would be a distinct contravention of the condition on which the money was given and a misuse of public money. Yet it is because the Rashtriya Mandali will not comply with this unreasonable demand that the Moderates of Nagpur seem to have given the coup de <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> to the Nagpur session. The plea of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of schoolboy rowdyism is plainly disingenuous, for these gentlemen were willing to face that terrible danger provided the Nationalists paid in their funds to the Reception Committee and accepted their nominee as President; these therefore are the real points on which the Moderate party is unwilling to compromise and the plea of rowdyism is only a convenient if undignified excuse to cover an untenable position. For our part we do not think the question of the Presidentship need be made a cause of final cleavage. Dr. Rash Behari Ghose is pledged like most public men in Bengal to Swadeshi and Boycott and this is still the most important issue before the Congress. If therefore the Loyalists can still be got to listen to reason in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of the Rashtriya Mandali funds, we think the Nationalists might give way on this point to avoid a national scandal. If on the other hand the Rai Sahebs and Rai Bahadurs are obdurate, it is time for Nationalists all over the country to consult together as to the course they will follow in the two possible contingencies of<span class='page-number' id='s-734' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.734]</span> no session being held or of the Moderate party deciding to hold the Congress in another province.

The Bombay Moderates with their usual skill in the use of their one strong weapon, misrepresentation, have been writing and speaking as if the question of Mr. Tilak's election to the President's chair were a personal issue; they blame Mr. Tilak for not withdrawing from the field, talk of us as Tilakites and assume throughout that we are fighting for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and not for a principle. If it were a personal matter, Mr. Tilak who has always been an unselfish and unassuming patriot, always averse to pushing himself or to figuring personally more than was necessary for his work, always a strong fighter for the success of his ideas and methods but never for his own hand, would be the first to obviate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> discord by withdrawing. But it is not a personal matter and Mr. Tilak has not himself come forward as a candidate for the Presidentship.

In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> his personal right of accepting or refusing the Presidentship can only arise when and if it is offered him by the local Reception Committee or the All-India Committee.

But our idea of a leader is not and will never be one whom we have to follow as an individual for his own sake, whether he is right or wrong; we follow him only so long as he is faithful to the principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> and is ready to fight its battles in accordance with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>collective will</span> of the party.\n\nThe question was first raised last year in Bengal when at a meeting of the Nationalists in Calcutta it was decided to suggest to the country the name of Mr. Tilak as President of the Calcutta Congress and in accordance with this decision Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal, who was then touring in the Mofussil, was communicated with and asked to bring the question forward and take the sense of the public upon it in Eastern Bengal. We have never concealed the fact that this was deliberately done in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to throw down the gauntlet publicly to Loyalism, Anti-Swadeshism, Moderatism and every other *ism* which seeks to bring in foreign considerations and alloy or weaken the pure and uncompromising Nationalist creed. The nomination of Mr. Tilak was a crucial point as between the two parties, for three separate reasons. At that time the country was divided between the Swadeshists on principle and the Anti-Swadeshistsâ€”or, let us say, \"honest\" Swadeshists of the Mehta-Watcha type and still more sharply between Boycotters and those who trembled at the very name of Boycott. From this point of view, the attempt to secure Mr. Tilak's nomination was an attempt on our part to have the Swadeshi-Boycott propaganda recognised on the Congress platform. Secondly, there was and still is a small ring of Congress officials who treat the Congress as their own private property, decide in secret conclave what it shall do or not do,<span class='page-number' id='s-737' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.737]</span> and hand round the Presidentship among themselves and the occasional newcomers admitted to their ranks from the Legislative Councils, except when a live M.P. can be secured from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> had to be nominated to demonstrate Hindu-Musulman unity. The second object of the attempt to get Mr. Tilak nominated was to break through this oligarchic ring and establish the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the Congress as no mere <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> to be engineered by a few wealthy or successful proprietors, but a popular assembly in which the will of the people must prevail. Thirdly, the opposition to Mr. Tilak and the attempt to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> him always into the background arose largely from the feeling that Mr. Tilak's views and personality are objectionable to the bureaucracy and that the nomination of a public man once convicted of sedition would deprive the Congress and, what was more important to Loyalists and leading men of the Congress, of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> favour. But these very reasons which made the name of Mr. Tilak an offence and a stumbling-block to the Loyalists, imposed upon the Nationalist party the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of bringing forward Mr. Tilak's name year after year until he is elected. Leadership in the Congress must no longer be regarded as a convenient and profitable road to appointments on the Bench and in the Government Councils but as a post of danger and a position of service to the people and it must depend on service done and suffering endured for the cause and not in the slightest degree on bureaucratic approval, and the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> must be recognised as a sacred cause which exists in its own right and cannot consent to be regulated by the smiles and frowns of the bureaucracy which it is its first object to displace. These are the principles for which our party are contending when they insist on Mr. Tilak's nomination and they are principles which are essential to the Nationalist position and are as living today as they were last year. The question of Mr. Tilak's Presidentship will be always with us until it is finally set at rest by his election, for until then we shall pass it year after year.\n\nBut so far as the Nagpur session is concerned, the question no longer exists. The attempt to make this question wholly<span class='page-number' id='s-738' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.738]</span> responsible for the difficulty is disingenuous and the demand that Mr. Tilak should throw over his own party by a gratuitous refusal to be President if ever he is asked, so as to reassure irreconcilable Loyalists in their fears, is absolutely preposterous. The Nagpur Nationalists have put his name forward and they alone are competent to withdraw it. But such withdrawal is not necessary. They have failed to secure the necessary three-fourths majority and they can therefore no longer insist on his name unless they are asked to hold the Congress with their own funds. They are willing to withdraw in a body from the Reception Committee if the Moderates so desire; they are willing to co-operate on lines both definite and reasonable; and they are willing, if called upon, to hold the Congress with any Moderate President in the chair if the funds in Mr. Dixit's hands are paid in. But they are not willing to misappropriate public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> for the Congress funds and they are not willing to walk into the Loyalist trap by an admission of any personal responsibility for the disturbances that have taken place, in the shape of a guarantee that no disturbance of any kind shall take place at the time of the Congress. Such a guarantee can only be given by those who were responsible for the rowdyism or instigated it, and this unwarrantable charge has already been emphatically denied by the leading Nationalists; to ask them to give a guarantee is to ask them to admit what they have already denied. If therefore the Moderates insist on these preposterous conditions, the public will know whom they have to blame.<span class='page-number' id='s-739' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.739]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/mr-tilak-and-the-presidentship","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Nagpur and Loyalist Methods","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/nagpur-and-loyalist-methods","prvt":"Difficulties at Nagpur","prvu":"/cwsa/07/difficulties-at-nagpur","dt":"1907-11-05","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["nagpur-and-loyalist-methods"],"t":"Nagpur and Loyalist Methods","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The decision of the All-India Congress Committee, holding its session appropriately enough not in any place of meeting suitable to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> as a public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> but in \"Sir Pherozshah <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span>'s bungalow\", has put the crown on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the most discreditable intrigues of which even Bombay Loyalism is capable.

Now that the die is cast, it is time for us to speak our minds. From the whole course of the Loyalist manoeuvres in Nagpur since the strength of the Nationalist party in the Central Provinces became apparent, it was quite evident that from the first the Loyalists had made up their minds under <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> from Bombay to prevent the holding of the Congress at Nagpur. To effect this object they were prepared to bring about a public scandal of the most shameful kind and bring discredit on the Congress if only their party might win a tactical advantage and, as the chief Moderate organ in Bombay frankly put it, keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists. It was in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists that the session was originally arranged to be held at Nagpur and the prior claims of the Punjab ignored. For Nagpur was then supposed to be a sleepy hollow of politics, a happy-hunting-ground of Rai Bahadurs and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> pets and tame patriots with the official collar round their necks, where there was no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of Mr. Tilak's nomination <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> even a remote possibility and Sir<span class='page-number' id='s-740' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.740]</span> Pherozshah Mehta might safely hope to retrieve the crushing blow his dictatorship had received at Calcutta. The Congress cabal had, unfortunately for themselves, reckoned without the fiery <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and indomitable self-confidence which have always been the characteristics of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> in every country and every age of its emergence. The Nationalists of the Berar and Central Provinces took the work of proselytisation in hand and as the result of several tours undertaken by leading members of the party from town to town and village to village the sleepy hollow awoke to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, a great revolution of opinion was effected and Nationalism became in a few months a power to be reckoned with. It soon appeared that in Nagpur there was on one side the small body of wealthy, respectable and successful elders with their dependents, hangers-on and satellites and on the other side, behind a growing body of true patriots among the men of name and standing, the great bulk of the young men and the poorer middle class. When a trial of strength came over the question of Mr. Tilak's nomination the Loyalists could muster a large body of votes on the Reception Committee only by the wealthy men paying for the admission of their dependents and hangers-on, while even so against the Rs. 21,000 they could muster, the Rashtriya Mandali was able to show a total of more than Rs. 30,000, representing what would have been a substantial majority of votes if the rule of a three-fourths majority had not been in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. It thus became apparent that the Nationalist party might easily command a majority of the local delegates and, since the place of session was within easy reach of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> and a strong body of Nationalist votes from the North, from Madras and from the Deccan might be expected, Loyalism was evidently in danger of a serious reverse compared with which its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> at Calcutta might sink into insignificance. Nor was the outlook made rosier by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that there was on the Nagpur Executive Committee an active Nationalist majority led by a strong and fearless stalwart. It had become imperative, if the primary object of Loyalist politics, \"to keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists\" and so avoid a rupture with the bureaucracy, was not to be hopelessly frustrated, either<span class='page-number' id='s-741' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.741]</span> to drive the Extremists out of the Executive Committee and turn it into a convenient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for Sir Pherozshah Mehta's masterly manoeuvres or to transfer the Congress to a less central and thoroughly Loyalist locality where the Dictator's will could reign supreme.\n\nFrom this point onward the hand of the great wire-puller behind the scenes can be observed in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the developments on the Nagpur stage. Left to themselves there is little doubt that the two local parties would have come to some understanding; nor can it be for a moment supposed that the audacious and high-handed attempt at a shamelessly unconstitutional *coup d'Ã©tat* on the 22nd September was conceived in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of so harmless and insignificant a personality as Mr. Chitnavis. The attempt to expel Dr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Munje</span> and his Nationalist colleagues from the Executive Committee was a failure because leonine tactics require a leonine personality to carry them through and Mr. Chitnavis was trying to wear the giant's robe without possessing the bulk and sinews of the giant. But their failure and the disturbance that followed it served the alternative plan of the Loyalists. That disturbance was obviously not engineered by the Nationalist leaders since, their point having been gained, it could serve no purpose whatever and on the contrary might do them harm, as it was bound to give and did give the Loyalists a handle for discrediting the Nationalists and stood them in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> stead as a convenient and always serviceable pretext for breaking the Nagpur session if every other trumped-up excuse should fail. The same guiding hand is seen in the skill with which the very success of the Rashtriya Mandali was turned to the uses of the intrigue by the preposterous and cynical demand that the condition under which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> had been paid into it should be disregarded and a breach of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> with the public committed. Neither can we regard seriously the much advertised visits of Moderate leaders to Nagpur to effect a reconciliation, followed as they were by ostentatiously sorrowful and misleading telegrams to the effect that both sides refused to accept any compromise while the simple truth was that the Nationalists in their eagerness to have the session at Nagpur were making every time larger<span class='page-number' id='s-742' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.742]</span> and larger concessions and it was the Loyalists who throughout showed themselves intractable. It is not to be believed that if such influential peacemakers had been in earnest, the Nagpur Loyalists would have showed this spirit of inflexibility; it was obviously not a local product but made in Bombay, and all these attempts at conciliation were simply meant to prepare the public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> for the transfer to Surat which had already been decided on by the mastermind in Bombay. Meanwhile the wires were pulled at Surat and Madras and the Surat respectables and Mr. Krishnaswamy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aiyar</span> and his Mahajan Sabha danced to the skilful manipulation. We do not believe the Madras offer was anything but a feint, for Madras is much too near to Bengal and there is already a strong Nationalist party in the northern parts of that province; but to have only the single offer from Surat would have been to leave the whole intrigue too bare to the public eye. Our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> is confirmed by the Bombay correspondent of the *Bengalee* who openly says that Madras was not chosen because there were men in Madras pledged to Extremist views. Finally, the last act of the farce supplies the key to all that has gone before. An informal and unofficial representation from a minority of the Reception Committee is precipitately seized upon by the All-India Congress Committee, a meeting is announced not at Nagpur where the members might have gone into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> on the spot and arranged a working compromise, but in Bombay and at Sir Pherozshah Mehta's bungalow, as if the Committee and the Congress itself were Sir Pherozshah's personal movable property; and instead of calling for a report of the Reception Committee or taking cognisance of the fact that there were citizens of Nagpur willing and able to reconstitute the Committee and hold the session as arranged at Calcutta, the Moderate majority records a predetermined decision to transfer Sir Pherozshah's movable property to Surat at a safe distance from Bengal where the Loyalist position is as yet unbreached and there is no time for the Nationalists to instruct public opinion before the holding of the session.\n\nThe intrigue is now complete, to the huge <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span> of the *Englishman*, and officialdom is full of hope that Sir Pherozshah<span class='page-number' id='s-743' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.743]</span> will this year save the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span>. For the Nationalists it should be a spur to redoubled efforts to spread their creed into every corner of the country so that Loyalism may nowhere find a secure resting place for its foot-soles. As to the Surat Pherozshah Congress it would be the logical course for us regarding the decision of the All-India Committee meeting as a misuse of the powers of that body, to abstain and allow the Loyalists to hold a purely Moderate Congress of their own. The other alternative is to arrange forthwith the organisation of Nationalist propaganda in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gujerat</span> and make full use of the opportunity such as it is which the session will provide. In either case a conference of our party is necessary, for, in view of the bureaucratic campaign on one side and the danger of a retrograde step on the part of the Congress on the other, the times are critical and concerted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> imperative.<span class='page-number' id='s-744' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.744]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/nagpur-and-loyalist-methods","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Life of Nationalism","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-life-of-nationalism","prvt":"Mr. Tilak and the Presidentship","prvu":"/cwsa/07/mr-tilak-and-the-presidentship","dt":"1907-11-16","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-life-of-nationalism"],"t":"The Life of Nationalism","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"For <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> great movements, for all ideas that have a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> before them, there are four seasons of life-development.

The world admires and hates and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span>, but will not believe. The enemies of the idea have sworn to give it short shrift. They promulgate an ordinance to the effect that it shall not dare to live, and pass a law that it shall be dumb on pain of imprisonment and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, and add a byelaw that whoever has power and authority in any part of<span class='page-number' id='s-745' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.745]</span> the land shall seek out the first-born and the young children of the idea and put them to the sword. As in the early days of the Christian Church, so always zealous persecutors carry on an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inquisition</span> in house and school and market to know who favour the new doctrine; they \"breathe out threatenings and slaughters against the disciples of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>\" and \"make havoc of the Church, entering into every house, and haling men and women commit them to prison\". The instruments of death are furbished up, the rack and thumbscrew and old engines of torture which had been rusting in the lumber-room of the past are brought out, and the gallows is made ready and the scaffold raised. Even of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> to which the gospel is preached, the rich men and the high-priests and pundits and people of weight and authority receive its doctrine with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> and contempt;â€”anger, because it threatens their position of comfortable authority amongst men; fear, because they see it grow with an inexplicable portentous rapidity and know that its advent means a time of upheaval, turmoil and bloodshed very disturbing to the digestions, property and peace of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> of the wealthy and \"enlightened few\"; contempt, because its enthusiasms are unintelligible to their worldly wisdom, its gigantic promises incredible to their cautious scepticism and its inspired teachings an offence and a scandal to their narrow systems of expediency and pedantic wisdom of the schools. They condemn it, therefore, as a violent and pernicious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span>, belittle it as a troublesome but insignificant sect, get their learned men to argue it or their jesters to ridicule it out of existence, or even accuse its apostles before the tribunal of alien rulers, Pontius Pilate, a Felix or a Festus, as \"pestilent fellows and movers of sedition throughout the nation\". But in spite of all and largely because of all the persecution, denunciation and disparagement the idea gathers strength and increases; there are strange and great conversions, baptisms of whole multitudes and eager embracings of martyrdom, and the reasonings of the wise and learned are no more heeded and the prisons of the ruler overflow to no purpose and the gallows bears its ghastly burden fruitlessly and the sword of the powerful drips blood in vain. For the idea is<span class='page-number' id='s-746' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.746]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s deputy and life and death, victory and defeat, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> and suffering have become its servants and cannot <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> ministering to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> purpose.\n\nThe idea of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> is in the second season of its life <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. The Moderate legend of its origin is that it was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span> of Lord <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> begotten upon despair and brought safely to birth by the skilful midwifery of Sir Bampfylde. Nationalism was never a gospel of despair nor did it owe its birth to oppression. It is no true account of it to say that because Lord Curzon favoured reaction, a section of the Congress party lost <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and turned Extremist, and it is vain political trickery to tell the bureaucrats in their councils that it was their frown which created Extremism and the renewal of their smiles will kill it. The fixed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span> of these Moderate gospellers is that the national life of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> is merely a fluid mirror reflecting the moods of the bureaucracy, sunny and serene when they are in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span> and stormy and troubled when they are out of temper, that it can have no independent existence, no self-determined <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of its own which the favour of the bureaucracy cannot influence and its anger cannot disturb. But Nationalism was not born of persecution and cannot be killed by the cessation of persecution. Long before the advent of Curzonism and Fullerism, while the Congress was beslavering the present absolutist bureaucracy with fulsome praise as a good and beneficent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> marred by a few serious defects, while it was singing hymns of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> and descanting on the blessings of British rule, Nationalism was already born and a slowly-growing force. It was not born and did not grow in the Congress Pandal, nor in the Bombay Presidency <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Association</span>, nor in the councils of the wise economists and learned reformers, nor in the brains of the Mehtas and Gokhales, nor in the tongues of the Surendranaths and Lalmohans, nor under the hat and coat of the denationalised ape of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> speech and manners. It was born like Krishna in the prison-house, in the hearts of men to whom India under the good and beneficent government of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> seemed an intolerable dungeon, to whom the blessings of an alien despotic rule were hardly more acceptable than the plagues of Egypt, who<span class='page-number' id='s-747' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.747]</span> regarded the comfort, safety and ease of the Pax Britannica,â€”an ease and safety not earned by our own efforts and vigilance but purchased by the slow loss of every element of manhood and every field of independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> among us,â€”as more fatal to the life of the people than the *poosta* of the Moguls, with whom a few seats in the Council or on the Bench and right of entry into the Civil Service and a free Press and platform could not weigh against the starvation of the rack-rented millions, the drain of our life-blood, the atrophy of our energies and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> of our national character and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>; who looked <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the temporary ease and opportunities of a few merchants, clerks and successful professional men to the lasting pauperism and degradation of a great and ancient people. And Nationalism grew as Krishna grew who ripened to strength and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, not in the courts of princes and the schools of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Brahmins</span> but in the obscure and despised homes of the poor and ignorant. In the cave of the Sannyasin, under the garb of the Fakir, in the hearts of young men and boys many of whom could not speak a word of English but all of whom could work and dare and sacrifice for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>, in the life of men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and parts who had received the *mantra* and put from them the desire of wealth and honours to teach and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> so that the good religion might spread, there Nationalism grew slowly to its strength, unheeded and unnoticed, until in its good time it came to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, the destined place of its self-manifestation and for three years, unheeded and unnoticed, spread over the country, gathering in every place the few who were capable of the vision and waiting for the time that would surely come when oppression would begin in earnest and the people look round them for some way of deliverance.\n\nFor that an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> rule will <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> day begin to coerce and trample on the subject population is an inevitable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span></span> which none can escape. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> with full power of life and death over his servant can only be gracious so long as he is either afraid of his slave or else sure that the slave will continue willing, obedient and humble in his servitude and not transgress the limits of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> allowed him by his master. But if the serf<span class='page-number' id='s-748' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.748]</span> begins to assert himself, to insist on the indulgence conceded to him as on a right, to rebel against occasional harshnesses, to wag his tongue with too insolent a licence and disobey imperative orders, then it is not in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span> for the master to refrain from calling for the scourge and the fetters. And if the slave resists the application of the scourge and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>imposition</span> of the fetters, it becomes a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of life and death for the master to enforce his orders and put down the mutiny. Oppression was therefore inevitable, and oppression was necessary that the people as a whole might be disposed to accept Nationalism, but Nationalism was not born of oppression. The oppressions and slaughters committed by Kansa upon the Yadavas did not give birth to Krishna but they were needed that the people of Mathura might look for the deliverer and accept him when he came. To hope that conciliation will kill Nationalism is to mistake entirely the birth, nature and workings of the new force, nor will either the debating skill of Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> nor all Dr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span>'s army of literary quotations and allusions convince Englishmen that any such hope can be admitted for a moment. For Englishmen are political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>animals</span> with centuries of political experience in their blood, and though they possess little <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span> and less wisdom, yet in such matters they have an instinct which is often surer than reason or logic. They know that what is belittled as Extremism is really Nationalism and Nationalism has never been killed by conciliation; concessions it will only take as new weapons in its fight for complete victory and unabridged dominion. We desire our countrymen on their side to cultivate a corresponding instinct and cherish an invincible faith. There are some who fear that conciliation or policy may unstring the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and others who fear that persecution may crush it. Let them have a robuster faith in the destinies of their race. As neither the milk of Putana nor the hoofs of the demon could destroy the infant Krishna, so neither Riponism nor Poona prosecutions could check the growth of Nationalism while yet it was an indistinct force; and as neither Kansa's wiles nor his *vishakanyas* nor his mad elephants nor his wrestlers could kill Krishna revealed in Mathura, so neither a revival of Riponism nor the poison of<span class='page-number' id='s-749' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.749]</span> discord sown by bureaucratic allurements, nor Fullerism plus hooliganism, nor prosecution under cover of legal statutes can slay Nationalism now that it has entered the arena.

I have been reading his Arbroath speech again and my admiration for him has risen to such a boiling point that I am at last obliged to let it bubble over into the columns of the *Bande Mataram*. Mr. Morley rises above the ordinary ruck of mortals in three very important respects; first, he is a literary man; secondly, he is a philosopher; thirdly, he is a politician. This would not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> much if he kept his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>, politics and philosophy apart in fairly water-tight compartments; but he doesn't. He has not only doubled his parts, he has trebled them; he is not merely a literary philosopher and philosophic litterateur, he is a literary philosopher-politician. Now this is a superlative combination; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> cannot better it and the devil does not want to. For if an ordinary man steals, he steals and there are no more bones made about it; he gets caught and is sent to prison, or he is not caught and goes on his way rejoicing. In either case the matter is a simple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> without any artistic possibilities. But if a literary philosopher steals he steals on the basis of the great and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> verities and in the choicest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span>.\n\n---\n\nAnd so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> along the line. An ordinary man may be illogical and silly and everybody realises that he is illogical and silly; but the literary man when he goes about the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> will be brilliantly foolish and convincingly illogical while the philosopher<span class='page-number' id='s-751' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.751]</span> will be logically illogical and talk nonsense according to the strictest rules of philosophical reasoning. An ordinary man may turn his back on his principles and he will be called a turncoat, or he may break all the commandments and he will be punished by the law and society,â€”unless of course he is an American millionaire or a member of the ruling race in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>;â€”but the literary philosopher will reconcile his principles with his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> by an appeal to a fur-coat or a syllogism from a pair of jackboots; he will abrogate all the commandments on the strength of a solar topee. A politician again will lie and people will take it as a matter of course, especially if he is in office, but a literary philosopher-politician will easily prove to you that when he is most a liar, then he is most truthful and when he is juggling most cynically with truth and principle, then he most deserves the name of Honest John; and he will do it in such well-turned periods that one must indeed have a very bad ear for the rhythm of a sentence before one can quarrel with his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span>. Oh yes, a literary philosopher-politician is the choicest work of God,â€”when he is not the most effective <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> in the hands of the Prince of Darkness. For the Prince of Darkness is not only a gentleman as Shakespeare discovered, but a gentleman of artistic perceptions who knows a fine and carefully-worked tool when he sees it and loves to handle it with the best dexterity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of which he is capable.\n\n---\n\nOf course it is not his speeches alone for which I admire John Morley. I admire him for what he has done almost as much as for the way in which he has done it. He is not so great a man as his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> Gladstone who was the biggest opportunist and most adroit political gambler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> has yet engendered and yet persuaded himself and the world that he was an enthusiast and a man of high religious principle. But Gladstone was a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and his old henchman is only a man of talent. Still Mr. Morley has done the best of which he is capable and that is not a poor best. He has served the devil in the name of God with signal success on two occasions. The first was when he championed the cause<span class='page-number' id='s-752' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.752]</span> of the financiers in Egypt, the men who gamble with the destinies of nations, who make <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> out of the groans of the people and coin into gold the blood of patriots and the tears of widows and orphans,â€”when abusing his influence as a journalist, he lied to the British public about Arabi and urged on Gladstone to crush the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of democratic and humanitarian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> in Egypt, the movement in which all that is noble, humane and gracious in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span> sought fulfilment and a small field on earth for the fine flowering of a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. The second is now when he is trying in the sordid interests of British capital to crush the resurgent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of India and baffle the attempt of the children of Vedanta to recover their own country for the development of a revivified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian civilisation</span>.

Truly, Satan knows his own and sees to it that they do not their great work negligently.\n\n---\n\nMr. Morley is a great bookman, a great democrat, a great exponent of principles. No man better fitted than he to prove that when the noblest human movements are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> suppressed by imprisonment and the sword, it is done in the interests of humanity; that when a people struggling to live is trampled down by repression, pushed back by the use of the Gurkha and the hooligan, the prison walls and the whipping-post into the hell of misery, famine and starvation, the black pit of insult, ignominy and bonds from which it had dared to hope for an escape, the motive of the oppressor finds its root in a very agony of conscientiousness and it is with a sobbing and bleeding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> that he presses his heel on the people's throat for their own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>; that the ruthless exploitation and starvation of a country by foreign leeches is one of the best services that can be done to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>, the international crimes of the great captains of finance a supreme work of civilisation and the brutal and selfish immolation of nations to Mammon an acceptable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> on<span class='page-number' id='s-753' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.753]</span> the altar of the indwelling God in humanity. But these things have been done and said before; they are the usual blasphemous cant of nineteenth century devil-worship formulated when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Commerce</span> began to take the place once nominally allowed to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span> and the ledger became <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>'s <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bible</span>. Mr. Morley does it with more authority than others, but his own particular and original faculty lies in the direction I indicated when drawing the distinction between the ordinary man and the extraordinary Morley. What he has done has been after all on the initiative of others; what he has said about it is his own, and nothing more his own than the admirably brilliant and inconsequential phrases in which he has justified wickedness to an admiring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>.\n\n---\n\nMan has been defined sometimes as a political animal and sometimes as a reasoning animal, but he has become still more pre-eminently a literary animal. He is a political animal who has always made a triumphant mess of politics, a reasoning animal whose continual occupation it is to make a system out of his blunders, a literary animal who is always the slave of a phrase and not the least so when the phrase means nothing. The power of the phrase on humanity has never been sufficiently considered. The phrase is in the nostrils of the vast unruly mass of mankind like the ring in the nose of a camel. It can be led by the phrasemaker wherever he wishes to lead it. And the only distinction between the sage and the sophist is that the phrases of the sage mean something while the phrases of the sophist only seem to mean something. Now Mr. Morley is an adept in the making of phrases which seem to mean something.\n\n---\n\nTake for instance his phrase \"My anchor holds.\" Mr. Morley complains that he who has served Liberalism so long and so well, is not allowed to be illiberal when he likes, that when he amuses himself with a little reaction he is charged with deserting his principles! \"It is true, gentlemen,\" says Mr. Morley, \"that I am doing things which are neither liberal nor democratic; but,<span class='page-number' id='s-754' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.754]</span> then, my anchor holds. Yes, gentlemen, I dare to believe that my anchor holds.\" So might a clergyman detected in immorality explain himself to his parishioners, \"It is true I have preached all my life continence and chastity, yet been found in very awkward circumstances; but what then? My anchor holds. Yes, dear brethren in Christ, I dare to believe that my anchor holds.\" So might Robespierre have justified himself for the Reign of Terror, \"It is true, Frenchmen, that I have always condemned <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capital punishment</span> as itself a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span>, yet am judicially massacring my countrymen without pause or pity; but my anchor holds. Yes, citizens, I dare to believe that my anchor holds.\" So argues Mr. Morley and all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> applauds in a thousand newspapers and acquits him of political sin.\n\nBut of course Mr. Morley's crowning mercy is the phrase about the fur coat. It is true that the simile about the coat is not new in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>; for a man who abandons his principles has always been said to turn his coat; but never has that profitable manoeuvre been justified in so excellently literary and philosophic a fashion before. Mr. Morley has given us the philosophy of the turncoat. \"Principles\", he has said in effect, \"are not a light by which you can <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> your steps in all circumstances, but a coat which is worn for comfort and convenience. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Canada</span>, which is cold, you have to wear a fur coat, there is no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> for it; in Egypt which is hot, you can change it for thin alpaca; in India where it is very hot indeed, you need not wear a coat at all; the natives of the country did not before we came and we should not encourage them to go in for such an uncomfortable luxury. It is just so with principles, democratic and other.\" The reasoning is excellent and of a very wide application. For instance it may be wrong in England to convict a political opponent for political reasons of an offence of which you know him to be innocent and on evidence you know to be false, or to sentence a man to be hanged for a murder which you are quite aware somebody else committed, or to disregard the plainest evidence and allow a bestial ravisher to go free because he happens to be a hog with a white skin, but it is absurd to suppose that such principles can keep in<span class='page-number' id='s-755' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.755]</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heat</span> of the Indian sun. It is difficult to know what iniquity reasoning of this sort would not cover. \"I thoroughly believe in the ten Commandments,\" <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Caesar</span> Borgia might have said in his full career of political poisonings and strangulations, \"but they may do very well in one country and age without applying at all to another. They suited Palestine, but mediaeval <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> is not Palestine. Principles are a matter of chronology and climate, and it would be highly unphilosophical and unpractical of me to be guided by them as if I were Christ or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Moses</span>. So I shall go on poisoning and strangling for the good of myself and Italy and leave 'impatient idealists' to their irresponsible chatter. Still I am a Christian and the nephew of a pope, so my anchor holds, yes, my anchor holds.\"\n\n---\n\nMr. Morley's fur coat is one of the most comprehensive garments ever discovered. All the tribe of high-aiming tyrants and patriotic pirates and able political scoundrels and intelligent turncoats that the world has produced, he gathers together and covers up their sins and keeps them snug and comforted against the cold blasts of censure blowing from a too logical and narrow-minded world, all in the shelter of a single fur coat. And the British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span> too, that wondrous production of a humorous Creator, seeking justification for the career of cynical violence its representatives have entered on in India, rejoices in Mr. Morley's fur coat and snuggles with a contented chuckle into its ample folds. Am I wrong in saying that Honest John is a wonder-worker of the mightiest and that Aaron's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> rod was a Brummagem fraud compared with Mr. Morley's phrases? *Vivat* John Morley!<span class='page-number' id='s-756' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.756]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-in-praise-of-honest-john","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Bureaucratic Policy","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/bureaucratic-policy","prvt":"The Life of Nationalism","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-life-of-nationalism","dt":"1907-11-18","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["bureaucratic-policy"],"t":"Bureaucratic Policy","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The policy of the bureaucracy at the present moment would be a curious study to any dispassionate observer of politics. It is not an unmixed and fearless policy of repression, yet the repression, wherever entered on, is as thoroughgoing, ruthless and without scruple as the most virulent advocate of the strong hand could desire. It is not a policy of frank and wise concession, though concessions of a kind are fitfully made with no very apparent rhyme or reason. A Coercion Act is put upon the Statute-book of the most thoroughly Russian severity; it is supposed to be passed in hot haste to meet a crisis of an exceptional kind and to be urgently and imperatively demanded by the Chief Bureaucrats of three provinces who decline to be responsible otherwise for the preservation of peace and the British rule within their respective jurisdictions; yet when it has been passed, it is only applied to a single district in the whole of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. The protests of Moderate politicians against the deportations and their urgent pleas for the release of the prisoners in Mandalay are brushed aside with contempt, yet the very next news is that Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh are released and on their way homeward. Simla, vowing it will ne'er <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span>, has consented. On the other hand Liakat Hussain is pursued with relentless severity, a politically-minded High Court Bench discharges with a contemptuous impatience the appeals brought before it in political cases, and the wholesale persecutions of young men in the mofussil <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> and the campaign against the Nationalist Press does not relax.

With <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> respect to Hare Street we will offer another explanation which we think will be found nearer to the mark.\n\nThe policy of the Anglo-Indian bureaucrats has always been checked by their strong sense of the weakness of their position in India. They know perfectly well that if the whole population of India gets to be infected by the enthusiastic beliefs and insurgent spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, their present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> sway over the country will at once become an impossibility. They know that the almost universal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> of the educated class to Nationalism is a contingency of the near <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> and that Nationalism having once taken possession of the educated class must immediately proceed to invade the masses; such a consummation is sure to be immensely hastened by a policy of unflinching repression which will alienate the whole educated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>. The bureaucracy have indeed no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> for the educated class, and the policy dearest to their hearts would be to create in the masses a counterpoise to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuals</span>, such as another bureaucracy once hoped to create in Russia. It is not likely that they will fix any permanent hope, still less their main hope, on the policy of setting Hindu and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> by the ears by an unstinted pampering of the latter community, however thoroughly they may have resorted to that expedient in the terror of the moment; for by doing so they will not only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to weld the Hindu population into a homogeneous whole, but they will be creating a new and dangerous power in the country in a Mahomedan community excited by new hopes and eager to recover their old ascendency. On the other hand, the masses under present circumstances are not easily accessible to a foreign and unsympathetic handful of aliens chiefly known to them through a corrupt, brutal and cruelly oppressive police, while the work of educating them into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> will take a long time and may be no less a failure in the end than the old plan of creating a permanently loyal middle class as a support to foreign rule against the regrets of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span> and the possible fanaticism of the masses. Awaiting therefore the launching and success of their experiment with the masses the<span class='page-number' id='s-758' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.758]</span> bureaucrats would like to keep the more pliable portion of the educated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> as long as possible in their own hands and set them against Nationalism. But they are not prepared to purchase this support at the sacrifice of any least fragment of their absolute authority and irresponsible power; they are only willing to appease the rising unrest by sham concessions or any temporary and isolated step which will not affect their prestige or their authority. The difficulty is that with the exception of the Loyalist section of the Moderate party led by men like Sir Pherozshah Mehta, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> would be satisfied with apparent concessions sufficient only to meet the claims of the wealthier upper ten of the educated community to titles, honour and position; the more advanced section which places patriotism before loyalty demands in addition such a substantial concession as would in their opinion pave the way for complete self-government in the future; but this the bureaucracy are not prepared to concede. Yet the Loyalists are precisely those whose support is least worth having. Really strong in commercial centres like Bombay and Surat, wearing an appearance only of strength, in other parts where Nationalism has not yet put forth a strength, it is a waning <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> constitutionally prone to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> and incapable of exciting enthusiasm.\n\nSuch is the position which the bureaucrats have to face, and once we realise it their policy becomes quite coherent and intelligible. They have to be prepared against the possibility of the flood of Nationalism submerging the whole country in spite of all the dams they may erect, and for this reason they are arming themselves with extraordinary powers which will enable them to check its future expansion and crush it where it has already established itself. At the present moment they hope to get it under without persisting in a general repression which would drive the whole educated community into the Nationalist camp. They have got Bipin Pal and Liakat under lock and key, Brahmabandhab is dead, Aswini Dutta may be paralysed by a rigorous enforcement of the new Act in Bakarganj, and of all the more powerful Nationalist speakers and writers one or two only have so far escaped the attack made upon them. The<span class='page-number' id='s-759' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.759]</span> bureaucracy may well hope that the back of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is broken and relax their legal thumbscrew, at least until they have seen what Sir Pherozshah can do at Surat. Any fresh development of Nationalism they are prepared to meet by ruthless repression. Wherever they see it spreading itself by open propaganda, they will forthwith apply the Gagging Act; wherever it spreads by its own force without the aid of the platform they will attack it through the young men as at Rangpur, Dinajpur, Dacca and Midnapore, and whatever leader or active propagandist comes forward, they will find some pretext to thrust into prison. Meanwhile they will pursue their policy of isolating the movement, locally by crushing it where it is bold and vehement while they will play with and indulge it for a time where it is milder and more cautious, politically by setting all other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> in the country against it.\n\nThis is their second line of defence, to find for themselves as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> points of support as possible against Indian Nationalism amongst the Indians themselves. Their first hope is in the Mahomedans whom they will encourage enough to buy their hostility to the Hindus, but not enough to make them really powerful or give an impetus to a Mahomedan revival. Their second hope is in the landed aristocracy whom they broke and ground into the dust with the aid of the newly created middle class and would now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in in their turn to help in crushing that very middle class grown too powerful for its creator. Their third hope is in the masses whom they expect to dominate partly by a carefully conceived primary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, partly by decentralising their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> sufficiently to give the District Officer direct touch with and autocratic control over the peasantry and partly by creating in officially controlled Panchayats instruments of check and supervision among the masses themselves. Their fourth point of support is in the Loyalist-cum-Moderate party in the Congress. It is to keep the way open for a reconciliation with that party that Lajpat Rai has been released, the Gagging Act kept in abeyance outside Bakarganj and overtures made in the demi-official Press, notably in such foul-mouthed revilers of all educated India as the C. M. *Gazette* and the *Englishman* to the<span class='page-number' id='s-760' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.760]</span>re sensible and sober <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> in the Congress.

The question is, \"What <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> has it of success? and what should be the line taken by the Nationalist party to frustrate this curious mixture of force and guile?\" That is the chief problem to which we have now to turn our attention.<span class='page-number' id='s-761' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.761]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/bureaucratic-policy","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"About Unity","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/about-unity","prvt":"By the Way - In Praise of Honest John","prvu":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-in-praise-of-honest-john","dt":"1907-11-19","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["about-unity"],"t":"About Unity","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Our esteemed contemporary, the *Bengalee*, has recently been reading us eloquent sermons on the uses and advantages of unity.

Political unity can be prepared by men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> parts of the country joining in a common struggle for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of a single national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span>, but the other unity is only possible if the whole nation is inspired by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> spirit and one idea. The *Bengalee* thinks there is substantially such an unity between, say, Sir Pherozshah <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span>, Srijut Surendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Banerji</span> and Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal; but we have our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span>. Surendra wants Colonial Self-government, Pherozshah would be hugely pleased with something infinitely less; Bipin Chandra wants <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> autonomy. Where is the unity? If Colonial Self-government for India, that political monstrosity, means anything, it means a hampered and provincial autonomy; the Nationalists strive for a complete and international autonomy, and if our contemporary thinks that is a small or merely academic difference, we cannot compliment him on his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> either of history or politics. We will admit however for the sake of argument that our aim is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span>, though in one case frankly expressed and in the other hidden under a veil, but that our methods are different. How then can there be that unity of action for which the *Bengalee* so sonorously but hazily pleads? Unity of action along with and unaffected by difference of methods is a kind of unity which we do not understand, and we rather suspect it is a chimaera from the land of confused ideas very much on a par with the \"Colonial Self-government for India\" of our friends or Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s wonderful reconciliation of a free Press and Platform with an autocratic government. If one party has petitioning for its method and another rejects it for passive resistance, how can there be unity of action? Or if one party insists on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> with and opposition to the bureaucracy (another twy-natured and self-contradictory figment from dreamland) and the other repudiates the association, how<span class='page-number' id='s-763' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.763]</span> can there be united action? If united action is at all possible in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, it is because the Moderate party in Bengal has ceased to be wagged by its loyalist tail and is now following the lead of its small but advanced head which is in sympathy with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> of the Nationalist ideas though it is not prepared to carry them to their complete and logical end with the thoroughness and audacity which true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> requires. The Moderates have given up for the present the policy of mendicancy, they have given their adherence to the programme of passive resistance though only in part. So far therefore as the methods of the two parties agree, united action is possible, though difference of fundamental ideas and difference of spirit make it impossible for that concord to be real and wholehearted, even if personal misunderstandings and dislikes did not stand in the way. But it is only in Bengal that even so much unity is possible, though there is a tendency in that direction in Madras. In the rest of India Moderatism is in its public professions and actions frankly loyalist and is quite prepared to eject the Nationalists from the Congress so far as it can be done with safety to itself. The Nagpur affair and the action of the All-India Congress Committee prove that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> doubt. Where then is the basis of unity? For that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, the Bengal Moderates while they sing dulcetly to us the praises of unity, have invariably joined heartily in Loyalist attempts to suppress the voice of Nationalism in the Congress. They were, we are convinced, consenting parties to the unconstitutional political trickery by which Sir Pherozshah transferred the meeting place of the Congress to one of his own pocket boroughs. Again we ask, on what ground can we meet for heartily united action? We have our work to do and cannot wait for ever on sweet words and professions used as a veil for secretâ€”well, shall we say, diplomacy? We are ourselves anxious to carry the support of our Moderate countrymen with us in our struggles, but their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>friendship</span> must first become less of the \"I <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> you and kick you downstairs\" kind than it is at present.

There is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> remark of our contemporary's, however, which seems to us unfair to the Nationalist party and with which therefore we feel bound to join issue. He censures the Nagpur Nationalists for forcing on a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> in the camp over a personal question like the election of Mr. Tilak as President. The question of the Presidentship is, in his opinion, not only a purely personal issue but also extremely trivial, as the President has no function of importance and a democratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> like the Congress ought not to make a vital issue out of a nomination to a purely honorific post. We have already given our reasons for originally raising and still persisting in this question and we again assert that we are not swayed in the slightest degree by personal questions. It will not raise Mr. Tilak in our eyes if he becomes President, it will not lower him in our eyes if he is never nominated. To a certain extent the Presidentship is a position of honour, and so far as it is so, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> of ability and reputation, an acknowledged leader and moulder of opinion who has suffered courageously for the country is entitled to that honour. But that is not the position we take. The Presidentship is in our view much more a position of responsibility and service. We cannot agree that it is of no importance who is chosen to fill the chair, even if the Congress be a democratic body, which, as at present constituted and conducted, it is not. In no democratic assembly is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of the President, whether he be a virtual ruler, as<span class='page-number' id='s-765' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.765]</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span>, or only a moderator, as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span>, a question of no importance. Our Congress is not as yet either a deliberative or a legislative body, but even so the Presidentship is a function of considerable importance. The President is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> observers of the dignity and personality of that year's session and as such his address, though it may not be binding on the whole body, is an utterance of great weight and is or ought to be largely indicative of the national temper and policy. The Congress shows the importance it attaches to his address by devoting the first day to it, an arrangement which, if the address has no weight or value as a manifesto of Congress views and policy, is an absurd and reprehensible waste of time. Besides, the President is a moderator of debate in the Subjects Committee, and of rule and decorum in the public sitting. When divided views are before the national gathering it depends on him whether all sides shall get a fair <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span> and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of impressing their views on the Congress. We raised the question of Mr. Tilak's Presidentship at a time when Swadeshi was the question before the country partly in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that the most powerful Swadeshi worker in the country might pronounce for Swadeshi from the President's chair and the Congress by electing him might show its sympathy with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. We made no secret of our object at the time and it was certainly not of a personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. But there was a second point at issue which was in the minds of all though it was never formulated, and this too was a point of principle, viz. that the Congress should not in any of its actions be influenced by the desire of bureaucratic favour or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of bureaucratic displeasure, that it should declare its complete independence as a body which looked to the people alone and not to the bureaucracy. This could not be better done than by the election of a great man and leader who was not a persona grata with the bureaucrats and had undergone sentence of imprisonment for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> of patriotism. That is the real difficulty in the way of the Moderates' accepting Mr. Tilak and it is equally the reason why the Nationalists refuse to give up their point. An apparently personal question often conceals one of essential principle, even when the person is not as in this case<span class='page-number' id='s-766' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.766]</span> a great patriot and leader. It was not for profligate John Wilkes that the people of Middlesex fought in the eighteenth century but for the liberty of the Press which was attacked in his person.

The old school of politics was chiefly remarkable for a blithe indifference to facts and an extraordinary predilection for vague abstractions which could not possibly apply to the conditions with which our political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> had to deal. The nineteenth-century Indian politician never cared to study <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>, but used a ready-made and high-sounding philosophy of politics based chiefly on the circumstances and conditions of modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> politics which had no validity at all for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. The result of this divorce from real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> was a tendency to use words without caring to consider their real practical meaning. We find the *Bengalee* in its article learnedly repeating these old mistakes. It builds wordy arguments from the terms of modern Science without grasping the true facts and hard realities of life, without a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of which the terms cannot be correctly applied. It argues from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> that progress is an ever-increasing unity of ever-developing parts, that therefore progress is nothing but unity, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> is nothing but unity, greatness is nothing but unity, ergo unity is not a means but an end, not an important or necessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> to arriving at progress, freedom and greatness but itself at once progress, freedom and greatness. This is merely playing with words. The question is, what is this unity which the *Bengalee* makes so much of and which it asks us to prefer to our principles and in its name to join in action which we believe to be harmful to the country? If our contemporary means political unity, the<span class='page-number' id='s-768' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.768]</span> formation of all the communities and races in the country into a single political organism with a common centre of life, that is certainly, as we have already admitted, a necessary condition of independence and greatness; but it is a thing of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> which is impossible so long as the centre of life in the country is alien and external, and all we can do towards it is to unite people of all communities and races in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> common struggle to replace the alien and external centre of political life by an indigenous and internal centre in the national organism itself.\n\nVery <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, but the question still remains, by what method can that result be attained? We believe the methods proposed by the Loyalists to be futile and injurious, we understand their aim to be not the independence of the national organism, but an impossible scheme of two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of political life controlling the country at the same time of which the alien shall be supreme and yet the indigenous shall be free! What the *Bengalee* asks of us is to disregard this vital difference of opinion and aim and be united,â€”in what? In aiming at an object which we believe to be absurd, by means which we believe to be futile. It does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, says the *Bengalee*, in what we are united, so long as we are united; for unity is progress, unity is freedom and greatness. So that if we are united in petitioning we are by the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of that unity free and great! The error of the *Bengalee*'s argument is that it confuses political unity, which is a necessary condition of independence, with unity of opinion and action, which is an immense help if the opinion and the action are in the right direction, but certainly not indispensable. It is not true that unity, even political unity, is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>identical</span> with freedom, for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> may be united in bondage or united in submission to a foreign and absolutist rule. Still less is it true that unity in following the wrong road is the true means to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>, much less the goal itself. We tried to prove from history that nations had been made free not by a scrupulous pursuit of unanimity or of unity in action but by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and courage in a number of its more energetic sons carrying away the bulk of the nation into a strenuous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to reach a great ideal.

The *Bengalee*, however, like all Moderate politicians, will have nothing to do with history or at least with the facts of history. History, it says in effect, is a record of human error, and the methods of which it tells us, involve great waste. So we in India are to invent something brand new, an ingenious and carefully calculated method of revolution which will bring us freedom and greatness without any waste, without any risk, by a minimum expenditure of trouble, disturbance and sacrifice. We <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> it has left out of consideration the fact that waste also is one of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span>'s methods, indeed that what we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> waste is one of the most subtle parts of her economy. No <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> or nation that refused to venture hugely like a gambler for huge ends ever arrived at freedom, none who has not been prodigal of his best has ever risen to greatness, and what has been in the past will be in the future; for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human nature</span> and the laws of human action remain the same, and cannot be new-shaped in Colootola.

So the clans gathered and Sir Harvey of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span> of the sons of Adam spoke from \"beneath the spreading antlers of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Monarch</span> of the Glen\" (so at least the *Englishman* dropping into poetry in its fervour assured us in sonorous blank verse) and behold! even as was the state of his stomach, so was the speech of Sir Harvey full-stomached and packed with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> titbits, comfortable, placid and well-pleased.\n\n---\n\nOf course Sir Harvey talked of the unrest, but his speech was eminently restful; it had <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the large benevolence, sweet reasonableness and placid self-satisfaction of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who had legislated as he had dined, wisely and well. It reeked of the olives and turtle soup and bannocks o' barley meal, it had the generous flavour of the liqueurs and the champagne. He first assured the assembled clans that the unrest was not purely a seditious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> nor an anti-partition movement,â€”Sir Harvey has found out that,<span class='page-number' id='s-771' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.771]</span> and we congratulate him on his statesmanlike perspicuity. But he has found out other things too. He has not only found out what the unrest is not, he has also found out what it is. It is simply this, that the educated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> are learning to realise their own position and to aspire to \"a larger share\" in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> of their own country. Now at last we see this luminous reading of the situation has shed a flood of light on Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s policy. The educated classes want their present share in the government enlarged. Most natural, most laudable! A benevolent Minto, a Radical Morley are not the men to stand in the way of such admirable aspirations. The present share of the people in the government of their own country is nothing; they want more of it: very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, we will give them a larger share of nothing. The Legislative Council is a nothing; go to, we will enlarge that nothing; we will add fresh nothings in the shape of an Advisory Council of notables to assist the educated class in doing nothing and lest the burden of such an arduous task should be too heavy for their educated shoulders we will give them upon the Councils plenty of capable helpers some of whom have been doing nothing all their lives and ought by now to be experts. If after that the educated class does not feel satisfied in its aspirations, if it does not feel as full-fed and happy as Sir Harvey after his haggis, well, they are ungrateful brutes and there is an end of it.\n\n---\n\nUnkind people have said that the intention of the Government was not to satisfy the aspirations of the educated class but to exclude them from the Councils under the cover of a misnamed \"reforms\". Sir Harvey is naturally shocked at so gross an imputation against his benevolent Government. All that the Government <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> is to make the representation of the lawyers and educated men a \"fair\" representation. It does not want to exclude educated men, but only to swamp them with zamindars, Mahomedans and Europeans; and it does not want to \"suppress the middle class\" but only to reduce them to a nullity. And this because they will not have \"what is scornfully known in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> as a vakil-ridden country\". It was evidently the generosity of the<span class='page-number' id='s-772' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.772]</span> champagne that made Sir Harvey expand all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> into the East. We are not aware that the vakil class as it exists in India is to be found anywhere except in India. It is the happy result of British rule in this favoured land that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> now consists of a huge mass of starving peasants, a small <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of dumb Government servants, and sweated office clerks, a landed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span> habitually overawed, fleeced and for the most part well advanced on the road to ruin, a sprinkling of prosperous middlemen and as the only independent class a handful of lawyers, journalists and schoolmasters. That is what Sir Harvey calls a vakil-ridden country. We have heard the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> Vakil-Raj, but we have not heard it used \"scornfully\" except by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Indians</span>. But no doubt when he talks of the East, Sir Harvey means himself and his brother Scots out to make <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> in the East, just as by Indian trade is always meant Anglo-Indian trade and by Indian prosperity the prosperity of Anglo-India. This is a sort of official slang which has become a recognised idiom of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language. Anglo-India is equal to India, India is equal to the East, therefore Anglo-India is the East. The Anglo-Indian has mastered the practice of the Vedanta, for he sees himself as the whole world, and the whole world in himself; why should he then make any bones about attributing his own sentiments to a whole continent?\n\n---\n\nThe Government, we are gratified to learn, has no intention of stemming the flowing tide. It wants instead to cut a new channel for the tide and divert it into a lake of notables where it will cease from its flowing and be at rest. As for the old channel of Swadeshi and Swaraj, it will be carefully stopped up with a strong composite of sedition laws, Gurkhas and regulation lathis. But meanwhile what does the tide itself think about this neat little plan? Well, says Sir Harvey, Moderate politicians are delighted, but the native press dissatisfied. We had to look twice at this remarkable assertion to make sure that the champagne (or was it good old Scotch) which Sir Harvey had drunk to the health of the unrest, had not missed its way and wandered<span class='page-number' id='s-773' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.773]</span> into our eyes instead of Sir Harvey's legislative cranium. All the native papers then are Extremist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>! What all, Sir Harvey? The *Bengalee* no less than the *Bande Mataram*, the *Indu Prakash* in the same boat with the *Kesari*? All Extremists, for have not all expressed dissatisfaction with reforms which would have been received two years ago with an unanimous shriek of infantine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>? Who then can be Moderates? Sir Harvey was right after all. It is the virus of Extremism which has entered secretly into the unsophisticated Congress <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and taught it to ask for something more than its long-cherished baubles. But in that case who are the Moderate politicians who are satisfied with the new playthings? Why, of course, Mr. Malabari and the Maharaja of Burdwan and Nawab of Dacca. For at this rate even Sir Pherozshah is suspected of Extremism.\n\n---\n\nSir Harvey has much to say about sedition and what he says is very interesting. He explains what sedition is and the explanation is of course authoritative, since it comes from the Law Member. First, the preaching of active rebellion against the British Government. To that of course there can be no objection. Whoever preaches an armed rebellion, does it with the gaol and gallows before his eyes, and is not likely to complain if he is punished. Secondly, efforts to reduce the native army from its allegiance, and then we get a remarkable sentence. \"The Government has been publicly charged with instigation of dacoity and sacrilege\" etc. As we all know a charge was made by the whole press, Moderate, Extremist and Loyalist, against local officials, of having given a free hand to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> hooliganism, and the charge was never refuted and now Sir Harvey identifies the Government with these officials and lays down the law that whoever brings a charge against any official is guilty of sedition! \"I and my Father in Simla are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>,\" the local official may now say, \"and he who blasphemeth against me blasphemeth against him.\" Secondly the Government has been charged with \"propagating famine and plague\". We note therefore that it is sedition to say that the economic conditions created and perpetuated by<span class='page-number' id='s-774' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.774]</span> the present system of government are responsible for famine and poverty and the diseases which thrive on poverty! Thirdly, the Government is seditiously charged with draining the resources of India for the benefit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>. So it is sedition too to talk of the drain or refer to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> and his luminous remarks about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> and exploitation! These are, it seems, \"turgid accusations which are made to sell and do not influence sober-minded men\". So Mr. R. C. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> is not a sober-minded man, nor Mr. Dadabhai <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Naoroji</span>, nor Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span>, nor even the knighted Bombay Lion. They are all turgid seditionists whose utterances are \"made to sell\". One wonders who and where the devil are these sober-minded men of Sir Harvey's whom he warrants immune from turgidity, and again one has to fall back on Mr. B. M. Malabari, the Maharaja of Burdwan and the Nawab of Dacca. O blest and sainted trio.\n\n---\n\nOf course Sir Harvey is strong on the seditious press, in other words, the organs of anti-bureaucratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>. Our newspapers are \"of a low class\", their editors have \"discovered that sedition is a commercial success\" and so write, it is suggested, what they do not believe because it sells. Fudge, Sir Harvey! If you could be transformed from a perorating official Scot into the manager of a Nationalist newspaper for the first year or two of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, you would \"discover\" at what tremendous pecuniary and personal sacrifice these papers have been established and maintained. If Sir Harvey knew anything about the conditions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in the land he is helping to misgovern, he would know that an Indian newspaper, unless it is long established, and sometimes even then, can command immense influence and yet be commercially no more than able to pay its way, especially when on principle it debars itself from taking all but Swadeshi advertisements. Fudge, Sir Harvey! The Nationalists are not shopkeepers trading in the misery of the millions; they are men like Upadhyay and Bipin Pal and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> more who have put from them all the ordinary chances of life to devote themselves to a cause, and in the few instances in which a Nationalist journal<span class='page-number' id='s-775' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.775]</span> has been run at a profit, the income has gone to Swadeshi work and the maintenance of workers and not into the pockets of the proprietors, while in almost every case men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and ability have foregone their salary or half starved on a pittance in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to relieve the burden of the struggling journal. These are your editors of low newspapers, traders in sedition, \"interested agitators\", men without sense of responsibility or \"matured understanding\". You say the thing which is not, and know it, a licensed slanderer of men a corner of whose brains has a richer content than your whole Scotch skull and whose shoes you are unworthy to touch.\n\n---\n\nIt is refreshing to learn that Sir Harvey thinks he has got under one chief means of sedition, the platform, by his gagging ordinance turned into law. He has stiffened it, he says, into a tap which can be turned on wherever his vigilant eye sees a travelling spark of sedition, so on that side the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span> and the profits of the clans are safe. But against the press he has not been able to find an equally effective extinguisher. The Government were apparently equal to the manufacture, but they want to try those tools they have before forging others that we know not of. The British public also might turn nasty if there were too rapid a succession of such stiffenings and Morley might find the fur coat an insufficient protection against the cold biting blasts of his friends' ingratitude. So Sir Harvey means to try a few more prosecutions first. But if Kingsford's pills prove ineffective, well, then Sir Harvey, in spite of the British public and Mr. Morley's sufferings, will be the first to recommend the smothering of the patient who refuses to be cured. After that the orator passed off into complaints about his bearer and praises of whiskey and soda and other subjects too sacred to touch. And so on the note of \"whiskey in moderation\" Sir Harvey closed his historic speech. And the British Empire knew itself safe.<span class='page-number' id='s-776' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.776]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-1","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Caste and Representation","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-representation","prvt":"More about Unity","prvu":"/cwsa/07/more-about-unity","dt":"1907-12-05","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["caste-and-representation"],"t":"Caste and Representation","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The policy of the bureaucracy in the face of the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, so far as it is anything more than crude repression, is a policy of makeshifts and dodges, and, though skilful in a way, it shows throughout an extraordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of the country they rule. The latest brilliant device is an attempt to reshuffle the constituent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of Indian politics and sort them out afresh on the basis not only of creed, but of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>. The *Pioneer* has come out with an article in its best style of businesslike gravity, in which it settles the basis on which representation should be given to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. For two years of unrest have brought us so far that Anglo-India is awakened to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> some kind of representation to the Indians, and petty details of administrative reform, the demand for which was then considered as much a crying for the moon as the cry for Swaraj nowadays, are fast coming into the range of \"practical politics\". Great are the virtues of unrest! Of course it is only representation and not representative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> which Anglo-India is bending itself to think within the range of possibility; for government means control and control is the last thing which they will <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to yield to us. When Viceroys and Law Members talk of giving us a larger share in the government of our country, they mean of course not control but what they <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a voice, and they will take <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> care that this voice shall be *vox et praeterea <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nihil</span>*, a voice and nothing more. But even a voice may be a serious inconvenience to an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> government and pains are therefore to be taken to substitute an echo for a voice, an echo of bureaucratic whisperings for the living utterance of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. In the representative institutions which the bureaucracy are likely<span class='page-number' id='s-777' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.777]</span> to give us, it is the drone of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> notables and the mechanical squeaking of officially manipulated puppets that we shall hear, and this, the world will be told, is the voice of the Indian people.\n\nBut Anglo-Indian statesmanship will not rest satisfied with reducing the ineffective voice with which they desire to delude our aspirations, to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of a flat and foolish echo; they will farther make every arrangement to turn it into a source of fresh weakness to the growing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> instead of a source of strength. They began of course, long ago, the attempt to make capital of the religious diversities of Indian society and recently the policy of setting the Mahomedans as a counterpoise to the Hindus has been openly adopted. In the new Legislative Councils the Mahomedans are to have representation not as children of the soil, an integral portion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> Indian people, but as a politically distinct and hostile interest which will, it is hoped, outweigh or at least nullify the Hindus. The bureaucratic Machiavels have not realised that the conditions of the new struggle which has begun, are of so different a kind from any yet known in British India that the Mahomedans cannot be turned into an effective tool in the hands of the bureaucracy without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> at the same time a danger to the artisan of discord who uses them. For the field of the struggle is not nowadays in Simla or on the floor of the House of Commons or on any lists where outside opinion can have a decisive or even a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> influence. It is not a voice which they have to set against a voice or a show which they have to outface with a better show, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> which they will have to call into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> to oppose a force. The Hindus have become self-conscious, they have heard a voice that cries to them, \"Arise from the dead, live and follow me,\" and they are irresistibly growing into a living and powerful political force. Unless the Mahomedans can be built up also into a self-conscious, living and powerful political force, their assistance to the rulers will be a mere handful of dust in the balance. But the moment they become a living and self-conscious power the doom of bureaucracy will be sealed. For no self-conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> aware of its strength and separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> will consent to go on pulling chestnuts out of the fire for<span class='page-number' id='s-778' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.778]</span> Anglo-Indian Machiavels. Even if they do not coalesce with the Hindus, they will certainly demand a share of the power which they maintain. Not in that direction lies any permanent hope of salvation for the absolute power of the bureaucracy. Perhaps the more thinking part of Anglo-India perceives this truth, hence the desire to find additional points of support and other principles of discord by which Indian Nationality can be hopelessly divided and cut to pieces in the making.\n\nOf course the *Pioneer* does not avow the real object of this scheme for creating and perpetuating as political entities divisions which every healthful political organism progresses by subordinating and discharging of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> political significance; but it is obvious enough. If it were possible for the bureaucracy to turn the social divisions of the community into political divisions, there could be no more fatal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of political disorganisation, and just as a natural indigenous rule finds its safety in better political organisation, so an unnatural alien rule finds its safety in disorganisation of what it preys upon. If it can, it destroys all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of political organisation except itself; otherwise it tries to create unnatural centres whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> will hamper and distract the organic growth. Caste with the proper safeguards is an admirable means of social organisation and conservation, but it has not and should not be allowed to have any political meaning. In India with the exception of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span> it has had no political meaning at all. In the old times it was different. All the executive power and functions of war and politics were in the hands of the Kshatriyas for the good reasons that the whole work of war and protection of the country from internal and external disorder was assigned by society to them, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> which did not give of their blood to preserve the peace and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of their country could not claim a direct control of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>. The Brahmin legislated, but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>legislation</span> was then a religious function which implied no political power or position, and the people at large exercised only an indirect control by the pressure of a public opinion which no ruler could afford to neglect.

On the contrary all classes, Brahmin, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span>, Vaishya, Sudra, could and did rise to any position of political power, even the throne itself, and except in Rajasthan where the Kshatriya <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> and institutions were preserved, caste came to count less rather than more in politics as time went on. All the great nation-builders have ignored caste as a political factor and it was only when the national spirit of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahrattas</span> declined after Panipat that a cleavage on the lines of caste took place which is still a slight danger to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> in the South. It is curious to find the British rulers who have done their best to undermine caste as a social institution now dreaming of perpetuating and using it as a political instrument. We do not think they will make much by this move. The centripetal impulse in Hindu society is already too strong and with most of us political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> by castes is too foreign to our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of thought to take root.

Only where certain classes are much depressed and submerged a temporary strife may be created, but the onward sweep of the national movement, profoundly democratic as it is, will lift these classes to a nobler function in society and give them prizes which a Government post or title cannot hope to rival. If we listened to our Loyalists and continued to depend on alien favours and look on them as the crown of our political life, then indeed discord might be sown and castes learn to view themselves as distinct and hostile political interests, but against the force of the national movement such devices will array themselves in vain; its democratic and unifying spirit will make light of all such feeble attempts to divide.<span class='page-number' id='s-780' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.780]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-representation","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"About Unmistakable Terms","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/about-unmistakable-terms","prvt":"By the Way","prvu":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-1","dt":"1907-12-06","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["about-unmistakable-terms"],"t":"About Unmistakable Terms","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We answered yesterday in general terms the claim advanced in the columns of the *Bengalee* to implicit and blind <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> Bengalis to the Calcutta Moderate leaders and to any local representatives of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> and moderation whom they may be pleased to erect to the gaze of an adoring public. But the *Bengalee*'s article contained also certain passages which demand more direct and plain-spoken answer and this today we will give. The *Bengalee*, not contented with its arrogant demand for submission, goes on to declare that the Nationalists, because they refuse this claim, are traitors to their country, that the men who opposed Mr. Chitnavis' autocracy at Nagpur or Sir Pherozshah's at Calcutta or Mr. K. B. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span>'s at Midnapore are rowdies and the Nationalist leaders, Mr. Tilak and Mr. Khaparde in the West or Srijuts Bipin Pal, Aurobindo <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> or Brahmabandhab Upadhyay in Calcutta have been abettors of rowdies, and it calls on the whole country to speak out in unmistakable terms against us. Unmistakable terms? Well, then let us have an understanding about terms, to begin with. What is the definition of a traitor to his country? Are men traitors who have exposed themselves to persecution, imprisonment and harassment for the sake of their country? Are those traitors who have made large sacrifices and devoted themselves to the cause of the Motherland? Or are those young men traitors who have stood in the forefront of the battle of boycott, braving the full fury of the bureaucrats and their police, and but for whom the boycott agitation would have flagged and perished after the first six months of excitement? The *Bengalee* says they are: for they may have done all these things, and yet if they oppose Mr. K. B. Dutt or Srijut Surendranath, they<span class='page-number' id='s-781' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.781]</span> are traitors to their country. On the other hand, have not those rather the complexion of traitors who are ready to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in police assistance against their countrymen in a Swadeshi conference although there has been no riot or violence, who boast that the police are in their hands and they can get all arrested who oppose them, who are ready to forget all the oppression from Barisal till now and call in Magistrates and police superintendents to the place of honour in national meetings, who are ready to take the *lathis* out of the hands of volunteers to please a District official? Or those, to take other examples, who wrote with brilliant success to Anglo-Indian papers to get Mr. Tilak prosecuted at the time of the Poona murders? Or those who pointed out Lala Lajpat Rai to the bureaucracy as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> to strike at when the Punjab was in a ferment over the Colonisation Bill? But, by the *Bengalee*'s reasoning, men may be the moral descendants of Mir Jafar and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jagat</span> Seth and yet be excellent patriots so long as they obey Moderate leaders and respect age and authority.\n\nThe second term we want to see so defined as to be unmistakable, is the term \"leaders\". The *Bengalee* calls for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span> and submission to leadership, but who are the leaders to whom we are to yield this unquestioning military obedience? What is the qualification in Mr. K. B. Dutt of Midnapore, for instance, by virtue of which we are called upon to sacrifice for his sake our national self-respect, our convictions, and our natural right to a free exercise of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> reason and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>? The *Bengalee* talks of age, but it is preposterous to set up age by itself as the claim to leadership in politics; nor did the Moderate leaders themselves show an overwhelming deference to age when they were themselves younger and more ardent. Respect for age as a part of social discipline we can understand, but leadership by seniority is a new doctrine. Then again the *Bengalee* talks of authority. What authority? The authority of social position, wealth, professional success? Are we to obey Mr. K. B. Dutt because he is the leader of the Midnapore bar just as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> Mahomedans obey Salimullah because he is the Nawab of Dacca? We decline to accept any such law of obedience. Authority is always a delegated power which does not rest in<span class='page-number' id='s-782' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.782]</span> the individual but proceeds to him from a definite source and returns to that source. Official authority proceeds from an organised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> executing the law which can both delegate its power to individuals and take them away again as it pleases. In popular movements the people are the only source from which authority can proceed. The people follow a leader because he best interprets their ideas, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> or because he shows himself the best fitted to organize and lead the popular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> to the realisation of popular aspirations and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, and the moment their confidence is shaken, the moment they begin to think he does not represent their best ideas and aspirations or that his methods of leadership are mistaken the authority begins to depart out of him. There can be no other kind of authority in democratic politics, nor can popular leadership be self-constituted. Those who demand military obedience to self-constituted leaders are not preparing self-government but killing it, striking at its very roots. If what the Moderate leaders want is to replace bureaucracy not by popular self-government but by the government of particular persons or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span>, if they want the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> to be not democratic but oligarchic or plutocratic, let them say so clearly, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s name, and let us have done with this juggling with words, and henceforward on both sides \"speak in unmistakable terms\".\n\nFinally, while we are about defining terms, let us know when a man becomes President of a Conference or Congress session. The *Bengalee* says, \"The attempt that was made to heckle the President and to bring into contempt his position as the head of the Conference was unique in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of our Conferences and Congresses. We never witnessed in the whole course of our public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> a proceeding... so derogatory to the authority of the President.\" The \"heckling\" took place before Mr. K. B. Dutt was elected, when the President's chair was vacant. Are we then to suppose that a man becomes President before he is elected? It is curious that Mr. K. B. Dutt himself made this unwarrantable claim when the trouble first began. By custom the Reception Committee designates a President but the decision of the Committee has no binding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> on the delegates of the Conference<span class='page-number' id='s-783' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.783]</span> who have always the power to elect anyone else whom they may prefer and not till a public confirmation by the votes of the delegates, has the President designated by the Reception Committee any authority or tenure of office. Until then he is merely a public man nominated for a particular function and the public have every right to \"heckle\" him so as to be sure that he will properly represent them before they give him their votes. Because till now this right has not been enforced, it does not follow that the public has forfeited its right, nor are we bound by \"traditions\" which mean simply the absence of lively popular interest and have no sanction in any reasonable principle of procedure.\n\nThe *Bengalee* sets up discipline as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> requisite of a popular movement and to back up its proposition it is so ill-advised as to quote the example of Parnell and his solid Irish phalanx. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of this example shows a singular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> politics. Before Parnell's advent, the Irish party in Parliament was a moderate party of Irish Liberals of very much the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> as the old Congress party before the Boycott. It was balanced in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ireland</span> by a revolutionary organisation using the most violent means employed by secret societies. When Parnell first appeared on the scene, his first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> was to revolt against the leader of the Irish party and make a party of his own. Consisting at first of a mere handful it soon captured the whole of Ireland and created the solid phalanx. But what was the secret of Parnell's success? Parnell, unlike our Moderate leaders, did not dwarf the ideal of a national movement but always held the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> independence of his country as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>: he made it a fixed principle to accept no half-way house between independence and subjection short of an Irish Parliament with independent powers, he suffered no man to enter his party who did not pledge himself to refuse all office, honour or emolument from the alien government and he showed his people a better way of agitation than mere dependence on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> on one side and secret outrage on the other,â€”the way of passive resistance, obstruction in Parliament and refusal of rent in the country. Only so could Parnell succeed in creating the solid phalanx, and when it was broken, it was by the folly of his adherents who receded<span class='page-number' id='s-784' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.784]</span> from his principles and sacrificed their leader at the bidding of an English statesman. If Srijut Surendranath wishes to have the country solid behind him, he must be a Parnell first and not shrink from a Parnellite policy and ideals. Only clear principles and unambiguous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> can secure implicit obedience.<span class='page-number' id='s-785' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.785]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/about-unmistakable-terms","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Surat Congress","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-surat-congress","prvt":"Caste and Representation","prvu":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-representation","dt":"1907-12-12","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-surat-congress"],"t":"The Surat Congress","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When the All-India Congress Committee first betrayed its charge and degraded itself from the position of a high arbiter and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> national affairs to that of a party machine subservient to a single political tactician, we said that there were but two courses open to us, either to refuse to accept a party trick engineered in defiance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, decency and all the common rules of public procedure and to hold our own Congress at Nagpur, or to go in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> to Surat and, if we could not swamp the Congress, at least to show that into whatever farthest nook or corner of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> Sir Pherozshah <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span> might fly for refuge, he could not get rid of the presence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, to fling ourselves at once on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gujerat</span> and organize Nationalism there, so that the Loyalist's chosen haven of refuge might become another place of shipwreck. In any case, we said, we must have a Conference of Nationalists this year and organise Nationalism all over the country.

But such a course was out of the question unless all could agree upon it, and this was not found possible. Especially when Mr. Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, fresh from his exile, were in favour of attending the Surat session, there could be no further question of our course. It has been decided, then, to attend the Surat Congress in what force we can muster at this short notice and do our best to hold the ground we have gained, as well as to see that certain questions which were held over last year are not held over again. A Nationalist Conference has also been arranged by the efforts of the Nationalists at Surat and<span class='page-number' id='s-786' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.786]</span> arrangements will be made for Nationalist delegates, a ticket of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> rupee being issued to each delegate for the recovery of expenses.\n\nWe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> upon Nationalists in Calcutta and the Mofussil, who are at all desirous of the spread of Nationalist principles and Nationalist practice all over India, to make ready at whatever inconvenience and, if they find it humanly possible, go to Surat to support the Nationalist cause. We are aware of the tremendous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> in our way. Surat is far-distant, the expenses of such a journey are almost prohibitive, for only a small percentage of our party are men of means, and the time for preparation is almost nil. And yet we must go. What is a Nationalist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> for if he cannot make up by his enthusiasm and energy for his other deficiencies, if he cannot make nothing of difficulties and turn the impossible into the possible? It is to sweep away difficulties and to strike the word impossible out of the Indian's dictionary that our party has arisen. The leaders of the Deccan call us; Lala Lajpat Rai, a name now made sacred to us all, is waiting to see the first fruit of his sufferings in the increase of patriots wedded to the principles for professing and practising which he has suffered, and the people of Gujerat are waiting eagerly for our advent. If <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> goes there in force it will, we believe, set flowing such a tide of Nationalism as neither bureaucrats nor Bombay Loyalists are prepared to believe possible. The Christmas concessions given by the Railway companies reduce the expense to a minimum and for those who travel by the intermediate, Rs. 75 at the outside should be enough. For we are going not as holiday sightseers making a national occasion an excuse for a Christmas jaunt and we do not demand comfort on the way or luxuries when we arrive.

There was plenty of shouting and confusion, but never any likelihood or the appearance of a likelihood of a resort to violence. The only violence was the assault on a delegate by the Moderates on the second day.\n\n(2) The statement about the bomb-incident, by which is apparently meant the attempt by unknown persons to wreck the Lieutenant-Governor's special seems to have been an afterthought. The incident was not known in Midnapore till Sunday evening and not a word was breathed about it by Mr. K. B. Dutt as a reason for putting by the volunteers' lathis. It is not true that the Captain of Volunteers was sent for by the Magistrate and readily yielded. The Captain was sent to the Magistrate,<span class='page-number' id='s-788' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.788]</span> doubtless at the latter's request, and made to resign because he could give no assurance about the lathis. Not a single volunteer gave up his lathi, nor was there any prohibition of lathis in the Magistrate's orders forbidding processions.\n\n(3) It matters little by what stages the enthronement of the Police Superintendent was prepared. The fact remains that he was given the central chair on the platform to which only a distinguished guest invited by the Committee or a visitor whom the whole country respects is entitled. It is a fact that the President frequently turned to confer with him when there was disorder and on at least <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> occasion made use of his presence to threaten his opponents, declaring that he would see that law was enforced. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> this, it seems, was only common courtesy. It may be so; we as \"rowdies\" cannot be expected to understand Moderate courtesy but it seems to us that such courtesy is an insult to the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>.\n\n(4) Mr. Dutt was certainly understood by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> of the delegates to say that those who would not obey him as chairman (before he was elected President) might go out. It is possible that he may have been misunderstood or has forgotten it, and we do not care to press the point, as its only importance was an incident throwing light on his temper and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span>. As for the correspondent's nonsense about discretion and valour, we did not know that it needed so much valour to leave the presence of K. B. Dutt, the Bold. The delegates were restrained by other Nationalists from leaving the Pandal and it was certainly discretion to allow another <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> to the President designate before taking the serious step of secession.<span class='page-number' id='s-789' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.789]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/misrepresentations-about-midnapore","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Reasons of Secession","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/reasons-of-secession","prvt":"The Surat Congress","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-surat-congress","dt":"1907-12-13","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["reasons-of-secession"],"t":"Reasons of Secession","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We have now placed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the facts of the Midnapore Conference before the public and the reasons which made a Nationalist secession inevitable are sufficiently obvious. The Loyalist legend that the Nationalists came prepared to break up the Conference by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, but were either baffled, say some authorities, by the \"mingled tact and firmness\" of Mr. K. B. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span>, or overawed, say others, by the presence of the President's bureaucratic friends and allies, and in their rage and disappointment seceded and held a separate meeting, is too contemptible a lie to be treated seriously. \"Why should they secede? What was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of a second Conference?\" ask our opponents with a holy simplicity. \"Did we not pass the same resolutions? Was not a translation of the President's marvellous address offered to the audience? What does it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> if the President broke his word? As for the interpretation of Swaraj as colonial self-government it is an unimportant matter, a prejudged matter; no Conference pretending to be a branch of the Congress organisation has any right to pass a resolution for Swaraj pure and simple and no responsible politician can support such a resolution. The Police Superintendent? Well, he was there only to see that the train-wrecking outrage was not repeated by the Nationalists in the Conference Pandal!\"\n\nLet us clear the matter of this jungle of irrelevancies. It was not over the resolutions passed by the Moderate Subjects Committee and Conference that the secession took place. When the Moderates saw that they had succeeded in disgusting and tiring out their opponents and had the field themselves they quietly adjourned to the Bailey Hall and held their own Committee and<span class='page-number' id='s-790' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.790]</span> passed their own resolutions;â€”this is a favourite trick with this party which they perform in the full confidence that their opponents will in the end acquiesce in the accomplished <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> for the sake of \"unity\". We are informed that two resolutions were seriously modified in Committee at the command of the President, but whether these modifications stood or repentance came with the morning, does not matter: for the resolutions were not the cause of the secession. The question of the language in which the President's speech should be delivered was a detail on which the Mofussil delegates felt strongly and it is obvious that if these Conferences are to serve the purpose for which they are created, the vernacular must be the medium employed. It is absurd to have the President's speech in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> and then to patch up matters by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> a translation, when the audience is already wearied out by listening to a long address in a foreign tongue which they do not understand. If Mr. K. B. Dutt had to address all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, though no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> asked him to, he could have delivered a lecture in the British Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Association</span> or published a pamphlet or written an article in the *Bengalee*; the Conference Pandal was not the place for his dissertation. But in any case the question of language was not a determining cause of the secession. Again we do not think it a light thing that a gentleman who fills the important and dignified position of the President of a District Conference, should, after he has been nominated without opposition on the strength of a clear promise, go back upon his word and yet cling to his post. Honour is not a light thing, a public undertaking is not a light thing, and that the President did promise, has been testified to by honest Moderates as well as Nationalists who were present on the occasion. But the seceders did not take this ground for secession, for they had consented, on the strength of Srijut Surendranath's qualified assurance, to the election which, once made, could not be unmade. As to Swaraj, we do not think it an unimportant matter, nor can we see that a District or Provincial Conference is debarred from passing a resolution in its favour; for by this rule several District Conferences, including the Bhola Conference, presided over by Srijut Ambikacharan Majumdar, have forfeited their right to be<span class='page-number' id='s-791' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.791]</span> considered branches of the Congress organization. But we will let that too go, for it was not to pass a resolution on unqualified Swaraj that a second Conference was held. The secession took place because of the arbitrary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the President supported by his party in evading the right of the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of delegates to express its opinion effectively on disputed matters and because of the use made by him of his alliance with the Police to support his arbitrary authority.\n\nThe emergence of two distinct parties in Indian politics has altered the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of our political problems and our political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and it is absolutely necessary that the constitution, methods and procedure of the Congress and the subordinate bodies should be constructed accordingly. Formerly it mattered nothing how the Congress was conducted, because there was no overt difference of opinion and whatever the Congress chiefs did or thought <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> was accepted without question or murmur. If there were dissentients they were easily silenced. But now there are two distinct parties with different <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, different methods of work, a different spirit and standpoint, each struggling to get the ear of the country and the control of our public activities. It is clear that if these two parties are to live together in the Congress, there must be some procedure which both can recognise as just, some means of determining their relative strength and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> each a means of influencing the course of Congress work in proportion to its strength. This can be done by constituting the Subjects Committee so that each party shall be represented according to the strength it can muster or by allowing each section of the delegates to choose by vote its own representatives; the representatives of both sides can come to an agreement in Committee on disputed points and where agreement is impossible, the majority of votes will decide the matter, subject always to an inalienable right of appeal by amendment to the whole body of delegates. With such rules of procedure there would be no reason why two parties should not exist side by side and the deliberations of the Congress and Conferences be conducted with decorum, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> and dignity. But if one side refuses to acknowledge the<span class='page-number' id='s-792' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.792]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of the other, if it tries, when it cannot ignore it, to put it down by bullying or by the personal authority of its own leaders, and when even that is not possible by what it calls a combination of tact and firmness but the other side calls a mixture of trickery and arbitrariness, when it keeps procedure vague and disregards the rules common to all public assemblies, then to live together seems almost impossible. This is the reason why the fight over the nomination of the President is so unnecessarily bitter. One side feels that it cannot allow the election of a Nationalist President because that would mean official recognition of the right of the other to share in influencing and guiding the Congress work. The other side feels that a Moderate President will simply be an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for Moderate tactics, not an impartial speaker of the House. He will rule Nationalist proposals and amendments out of order, refuse to take the sense of the House when called upon and by other arbitrary exercise of his authority serve his party. The rowdiness of which the Moderates complain is simply the clamorous persistence which is the sole means left to the other party to compel <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> and a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hearing</span>. All this the Nationalists have again and again endured in the hope that by sheer persistence they might get their existence recognised and such rules formulated as would permit of differences <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> automatically settled. But when the Moderates go so far as to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> in a third party is to weigh down the balance in their favour and that third party the common enemy, the bureaucrat and his police, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> of sufferance is over-passed and nothing is left but to separate before difference of opinion degenerates into civil war. This was the stage which by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of Mr. K. B. Dutt was reached at Midnapore. We bring no charge against the Calcutta leaders except that of supporting a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> instead of considering the interests of the country; we prefer to believe that they had nothing to do with the underhand methods of their local lieutenant; but the support they rendered him made him impervious to reason and left the Nationalists no recourse but secession. The Nationalist Conference, the Nationalist organisation is now an accomplished fact. If the local Moderates come to their senses<span class='page-number' id='s-793' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.793]</span> a *modus vivendi* may in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> be found, but in any case our Conference and Association will remain and work. Midnapore has taken the initiative in giving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> an organised shape and form.<span class='page-number' id='s-794' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.794]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/reasons-of-secession","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"The Awakening of Gujerat","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-awakening-of-gujerat","prvt":"Misrepresentations about Midnapore","prvu":"/cwsa/07/misrepresentations-about-midnapore","dt":"1907-12-14","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-awakening-of-gujerat"],"t":"The Awakening of Gujerat","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When the word of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span> has gone abroad, when the spirit moves over the waters and the waters stir and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> begins to form, then it is a law that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> energies are forced to direct themselves consciously or unconsciously, willingly or against their will, to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> supreme work of the time, the formation of the new manifest and organised life which is in process of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span>. So now when the waters of a people's life are stirred and the formation of a great organic Indian state and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> has begun, the same law holds. All that the adversaries of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> have done whether they have tried to repress or tried to conciliate, has helped what they sought to destroy and swelled the volume and strength or purified as by fire the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>. So also the efforts of those among ourselves who are afraid of the new movement or distrustful of it to check the pace and bring back the nation's energies into the old grooves, have only helped to increase the vehemence of the National desire to move forward. When Sir Pherozshah <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span> juggled the Congress into Surat, he thought he was preparing a death-blow for Nationalism: he was only preparing the way for a Nationalist awakening in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gujerat</span>. Nationalism depends for its success on the awakening and organizing of the whole strength of the nation; it is therefore vitally important for Nationalism that the politically backward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> should be awakened and brought into the current of political life; the great mass of orthodox <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hinduism</span> which was hardly even touched by the old Congress movement, the great slumbering mass of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span> which has remained politically inert throughout the last century, the shopkeepers, the artisan class, the immense <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of illiterate and ignorant peasantry, the submerged classes,<span class='page-number' id='s-795' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.795]</span> even the wild tribes and races still outside the pale of Hindu <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, Nationalism can afford to neglect and omit none. It rejoices to see any sign of life where there was no life before, even if the first manifestations should seem to be ill-regulated or misguided. It is not afraid of Pan-Islamism or of any signs of the growth of a separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> self-consciousness but rather welcomes them. It is not startled by the spectacle of a submerged class like the Namasudras demanding things which are, under existing circumstances, impracticable from Hindu society. When a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> sues for separate rights from the bureaucracy, that is a sign not of life but of stagnant dependence which is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, but when it seeks a larger place in the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and it tries to feel its own existence and its own strength, it is a true sign of life, and what Nationalism asks is for life first and above all things; life, life and still more life, is its cry. Let us by every means get rid of the pall of death which stifled us, let us dispel first the passivity, quiescence, the unspeakable oppression of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> which has so long been our curse; that is the first and imperative need. As with backward communities, so with backward provinces. It is vitally important to Nationalism that these should awake. Bihar, Orissa, the Central Provinces, Gujerat, Sindh must take their place in the advancing surge of Indian political life, must prepare themselves for a high rank in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> federated strength of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. We welcome any signs that the awakening has begun. It is for instance a cause of gratification that Orissa is beginning to feel its separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>, and to attempt to grow into an organised life under a capable and high-spirited leader, although we consider his political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> mistaken and believe that he is laying up for himself bitter disappointment and disillusionment in the future. But when the inevitable disappointment and disillusionment come, then will the new political consciousness, the new organized life of Orissa become an immense addition of strength to the forces of Nationalism. Yet it remains true that the only way these provinces can make up for lost time and bring themselves up swiftly to the level of the more advanced races, is by throwing themselves whole-heartedly into the full tide of Nationalism, and we do not know that we ought not to thank<span class='page-number' id='s-796' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.796]</span> Sir Pherozshah for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> us a unique <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> to light the fire in Gujerat.\n\nThe Gujeratis have only recently been touched by the tide of political life. Largely split up into Native States large and small and only partially under the direct rule of the bureaucracy, immersed in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> and fairly prosperous until the last great famine swept over the once smiling and fertile province destroying life, human and animal, by the million they had slumbered politically while the rest of India was accustoming itself to some kind of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. It was at the Ahmedabad Congress that Gujerat was for the first time moved to a political enthusiasm, an awakening perhaps helped on by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> of a thoroughly Swadeshi Exhibition with the session of the Congress and the inclusion, however timid and half-hearted, of industrial revival in our political programme. Then came the outburst of the Swadeshi by which Gujerat, unlike some of the other politically backward provinces, was profoundly affected. The ground has been prepared and Nationalist sentiment has already spread among the educated Gujeratis. The Surat Congress provides an opportunity to give a fresh and victorious impulse which will make Gujerat Nationalism a powerful working and organized <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>. The importance of winning Gujerat to the Nationalist cause is great. The Gujeratis <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> as the Bengalis did until the present awakening under a reproach of timidity and excessive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of peace and safety. The truth probably is that so far as the reproach has any foundation either in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> or Gujerat, the defect was due not so much to any constitutional cowardice as to indolence born of climate and a too fertile soil and to the prevalence of the peaceful and emotional religion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaitanya</span> and Vallabhacharya. Be that as it may, Bengal under the awakening touch of Nationalism has wiped out that reproach for ever and there is no reason why Gujerat stirred by the same influences, awakened to the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, should not emulate her example and take like her a foremost place in the battle of Swaraj. We must not forget that she also has great traditions of old, traditions of learning, traditions of religion, traditions of courage and heroism.

The emergence of a new school of thought, their vigorous and menacing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and enthusiasm have always made the votaries of established <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> uneasy and vindictive. In the frenzied anxiety to retain all power, in a paralysing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of change they raise a terrible clamour and try to play upon the timidity and the spirit of routine of the unthinking people. They cry for the blood of the new messengers without even patiently listening to their message. Even master-minds succumb to this weakness.

But while the Nationalists should pursue their line of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> with unabated zeal they are also to consider, in view of the fierce and vindictive opposition which they have provoked not only from the bureaucracy but also a section of their own countrymen, whether they should not work in their own way without coming into collusion with those whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> and methods of work render any concerted action hardly possible. We invite the Nationalists to Surat not so much to capture the Congress by violence, as our enemies maliciously put it, but to see that the Nationalist sentiment and Nationalist programme find their place in the deliberations and finally prevail. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> of us think that the Nationalists cannot pull on with the Moderates and Loyalists who determined to baffle their patriotic activities to democratise the Congress by a cobweb of malicious misrepresentation and vilification. The Nationalists indulge in no vague charges against the Moderates. They expose their high-handedness with an unequivocal statement of facts. But these people do not meet us on the charges brought against them but try to evade the real issue by irrelevant and senseless denunciations. Under the circumstances some of us thought it wiser and easier for the Nationalists to have an organ of their own, without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> the Moderates and Loyalists a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of misrepresenting and vilifying them. The experience of the Midnapore Conference shows that the delegates young and old all smart under the autocracy of the old workers, which is leading many to think a separatist movement preferable to a perpetual friction. But for the present we must put all such thoughts from us.

The object of the fund is to send to Surat a number of delegates with uncompromising views and of an uncompromising spirit who will see to it, so far as lies in their power, that the Congress at Surat shall make no backward step but, if possible, move a step further towards associating itself with the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of the country. We hope that no attempt will be made to take any backward step, but we know that there is a reactionary element in the Congress which would be only too glad to recede, and if by negligence we give them their opportunity, the responsibility for any backsliding will be ours. We hope also that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> will present a solid front against any reaction, but we have no right to be sure of it, and only if there is the strong moral backing of a number of delegates who will not compromise with their principles or allow respect of persons or utter persuasion or browbeating to sway them from their firm position, can we expect the Bengal leaders to stand fast against the pressure that may be brought to bear on them. The delegates who will be assisted out of the fund must therefore pledge themselves to stand firm for Boycott as a general principle for the Swadeshi resolution as it was framed last year, for National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span> and Arbitration as prominent planks in the Congress platform and to do their best to see that the Congress takes up the cause of the Transvaal Indians, rejects Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s reforms or any other sham and simulacrum of self-government and takes a sensible step forward in the direction of national organisation. The precise proposals which will be pressed upon the Subjects Committee will be formulated after due discussion in the Nationalist Conference which meets on the 24th at Surat, but these are the broad lines on which we propose to frame them.

He told his audience how the Congress movement, though originally very strong in Bengal, had failed to give satisfaction to the people as the methods adopted by the Congress were proved to be fruitless, how the old method of petitioning was not only considered futile but harmful, how the people had grown apathetic and despondent and how this despondent and apathetic mood of the people was converted into an active mood by the repressive measures of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span>.

Last came the Partition of Bengal and this stroke went right through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of every Bengali. They at first tried petitions, prayers, meetings, resolutions and protests, but soon found their uselessness. Something had to be done and the Swadeshi movement, which had received no attention when it was first introduced in Bengal, now gained fresh strength. The cry of boycott was first raised in Kishoregunj, in Mymensingh and then in Magura in the district of Jessore, from where it was taken up in Calcutta. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chinese</span> boycott of American goods had succeeded and the Calcutta people accepted the idea of boycott as excellent. The Calcutta leaders, however, first proclaimed it \"impossible\". They asked, \"Where is the strength of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> or the economic strength to do all this?\" They considered Swadeshi impossible and boycott still more so.

But people did not listen to this advice; they said they would try and see if the movement would succeed. The current of public opinion grew so strong that the leaders ultimately had to give their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to the new movement. They accepted Swadeshi but wanted to have recourse to boycott only for six months to see if the Partition would be withdrawn. The people wanted the boycott to continue and refused to believe that they were too weak for the purpose. They refused to be hypnotised and to consider themselves cowards. It was Swami Vivekananda who preached this doctrine to his countrymen. This was believed by the new party.\n\nYoung men and old worked for the movement. The young men took up the work of picketing and sold Swadeshi goods at cost price. When the Government began to check the students and prevent them from helping the new movement they left the Government schools and demanded National schools for their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. In this way the first National school came into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in Rangpur. Then there arose a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> for a National University. In this connection also the leaders would not join the new movement and some of the proprietors of private colleges stood against this idea. Yet the people showed<span class='page-number' id='s-808' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.808]</span> sympathy; the liberality of some supplied funds, and the leaders had to give their consent. Bengalis were thought incapable of real and earnest work and it was thought that they would not be prepared for self-sacrifice of any kind. Bengali people were taken to be cowards. This idea had become part of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> and was taught to them in schools. The result was that the Bengalis themselves began to believe that they were cowards, that their ancestors were cowards and that their sons and grandsons would all be cowards. But there were men who were not political atheists. They believed in the strength of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and were confident that a nation of cowards would be converted into a nation of heroes. That is the difference between a Nationalist and a Moderate; a Nationalist has firm faith in the strength of his people, while a Moderate has only moderate faith or no faith at all. The new thought made Bengali youths strong; they exposed themselves to the attacks of the police and the wrath of the Government, and they were prepared for jail. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> of the youths connected with the paper *Yugantar* actually complained that the paper did not publish sufficiently violent articles. Such daring and enthusiasm could now be seen in Bengali youths. The new spirit or Nationalist spirit is an unshakable and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> confidence in the strength of the nation. People have to take leaps into the dark, for reason is unable to show the way. You must take courage in hand and work. When the work regarding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>National education</span> was commenced, it was a leap in the dark, but it succeeded.\n\nThe lecturer remarked that provinces other than Bengal were in some respects superior to Bengal and therefore ought to be able to do what Bengal succeeded in doing. He said, \"We are seeing the light before us, we are walking on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s way, we are going to our ultimate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> surely and swiftly; nothing will daunt us, we welcome ordeals because they make us strong.

When I was told about the topic I did not quite realise its implications at first, but when I started thinking about it I understood its importance. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> about the concept of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>National Education</span> that are encountered here do not exist in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. Here in the Bombay Province, the meaning of the term \"National Education\" is not clear to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span>. National Education, with its specific connotation, is suspect and men of wisdom dismiss it. In Bengal, on the other hand, the need to explain the concept does not even arise. There may be people in favour of it or against it, but National Education is something taken by them as a given <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, as something they have experienced. There is no need in Bengal to explain or discuss it in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to convince people about the sense it carries. But in the Bombay Province, it has only a verbal implication at the moment; it has not yet gone <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> mere talk, and that may be the reason why people are suspicious of it.\n\nSomeone here told me that he does not understand what National Education means exactly. Someone else wondered whether there can be anything like National Education at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span>, particularly in the context of teaching, say, mathematics; he was at a loss to see how this could be called \"national\". The Honourable Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> does not say that he has failed to understand the meaning of the term \"National Education\", but it is obvious that he has not really grasped its significance. At the National Congress held in Calcutta, a resolution on National Education was passed unanimously. Unfortunately, since the Congress at Surat did not take place, it could not be introduced there. Mr. Gokhale made certain modifications to the resolution<span class='page-number' id='s-810' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.810]</span> on National Education passed in Calcutta. In his opinion, these modifications are not of much importance. But my opinion is exactly the opposite. Perhaps Mr. Gokhale is not fully aware of the true situation in Bengal with regard to National Education. The word \"national\" appears in this resolution three times and there is no doubt that it has been done with a certain intention. The alteration suggested by Mr. Gokhale does not speak of National Education; instead it introduces terms such as \"independent system of education\". That term has a different connotation and it does not really convey what we mean by the phrase \"National Education\". The Subjects Committee at Calcutta introduced the word \"national\" three times. It is not for nothing that this was done. National Education must be imparted in a national spirit: this was the resolution passed at Calcutta, and not a single word of it should be altered or dropped.\n\nNational Education must be on national lines and under national control. Why do we have to qualify the term \"education\" by calling it \"national\"? This question is asked by many. These people maintain that we are not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> to begin with. According to their thinking, what we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a nation is an imaginary thing, not a reality. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, they say, there are thousands of castes and subcastes, countless sects and subsects, and any number of religious creeds with differences of opinion and practice; in that case the use of the word \"national\" in the Indian situation becomes meaningless. But these people do not really understand what is meant by a nation. They suggest that a nation can only come into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> when these castes and creeds are abolished. But this line of argumentâ€”that we will have a nation only when everyone in the country has the same religion and there is only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>â€”is a fallacious one, for religion and caste are not permanent aspects of a nation. Other people argue that although India is a vast country geographically, still it cannot be termed a nation. But we view it differently. To us, by its very geography the country appears to be quite distinct from other countries, and that itself gives it a certain national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> stands out in the same way, separate from her surroundings, and in<span class='page-number' id='s-811' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.811]</span> thirty years it became an independent nation. The inner and outer <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of India, the customs, culture and religion of its people, have an independent character different from those of the rest of the world. It has its foundations in the ancient past.\n\nThose who oppose our view contend that India was never a nation. Let us see then what we mean by the word \"nation\". When we say that National Education should be imparted, it implies that we need not throw away our traditional background and introduce completely new ideas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>. When we look at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the country, we find that at one time we had a system of National Education. Look at our philosophy: what is in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> is also in the universal. A nation is a living entity, full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>; it is not something made up or fabricated. A living nation is always growing; it must grow, it must attain ever loftier heights. This may happen after a thousand years or in the next twenty years, but happen it must.\n\nOur personality, our constitution is made up of three parts. We have three types of body, gross, subtle and causal. In the same way the nation has three bodies. According to our philosophy it is not only the outward appearance, the gross body, that makes a complete <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>. All three bodies have to be taken into account; only then can we get some understanding of him. As with a man, so with a nation. To think about our nation is first to think about our physical motherland. Stretching from the Himalayas in the north to Kanyakumari in the south, its boundaries are formed by the seas on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>east</span> and west. Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span>, Godavari flow here unceasingly; here are ancient cities, tall and imposing temples, artistically designed palatial homes. Such is the part of this earth we call India. It is this picture, this figure that comes to us when we speak of our nation. This is the gross body of our nation. Bankim Chandra's song *Bande Mataram* describes this aspect very beautifully. Thirty-three crores of people live on this land with their joys and sorrows, their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and bad <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>: they are all part of its subtle body. Then there are aspects of the country which may undergo changes in the course of time, yet always remain in the body, in seed-state, as permanent as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>atom</span>; they<span class='page-number' id='s-812' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.812]</span> are always present there and, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> the origin, it is out of them that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> takes shape. This is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>causal body</span> of the nation.\n\nBut this is not enough. According to our scriptures, when we think of a man we think not only of his present condition but also of his past and future. The same is true of a country. When we speak of the rivers, mountains and cities of our country, we have in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> not only the present, not at all. What we speak of is a history of five thousand years. When we speak of Delhi and Agra, does not the image of Delhi as it was during Emperor <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Akbar</span>'s time stand before your mind's eye? That is why, in speaking of the nation, we should recall the great achievements of our ancestors; then Shivaji, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asoka</span> and Akbar at once become an integral part of our nationhood. So too the ancient Rishis. This is taken for granted. If we look at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span>, we see that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japanese</span> people never forget their ancestors who offered their lives as a sacrifice for the sake of their country. This sense of sacrifice is always present in the Japanese blood. When a warrior fights for his country, he recalls those sacrifices. This is something we must learn from Japan. We must learn from the Japanese how to honour our ancestors and evoke the spirit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> by remembering them. Whatever you do today, you are doing not for your own sake but to pay the debt you owe to them. This you must never forget. Not only your ancestorsâ€”the generations to come are also an organic component of your nation. When we envision an Indian nation, it should be along these lines. We should not be carried away by Western advances or cowed by their achievements. What we need is a wide, engaging vision of our nation and of nationalism; our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> must match that vision and as a result our nation will produce great philosophers, statesmen, warriors and commanders. I don't say this will happen today, but surely it will happen in the future.\n\nThe term \"nation\" is meaningful and significant; it has not been coined for political convenience. In Bengal, while formulating the concept of National Education, we have kept before us this grand idea of the nation. Let us see how the details have been worked out in consonance with this lofty and noble concept. We shall take the simple subject of geography as an illustration.<span class='page-number' id='s-813' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.813]</span> Imagine how this subject is presently taught in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> and private schools! The students are told about such-and-such a country with so many districts, with their District Officers and so forth; this is the kind of information imparted in geography <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span>. But how is it useful? When we teach geography in Bengal according to the ideas of National Education, we teach it in a different way. First we tell the children that India is our Motherland; in this way we make them aware of the gross body of the nation. We tell them about our rivers, Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada, etc., and what these rivers mean, not merely where they flow. In our national schools, when we teach the children about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span> we describe the land in which Shivaji lived. Speaking about Punjab, we tell the children about the Punjab of Ranjit Singh. Speaking about the geography of the Himalayas, we teach them how the land of the Himalayas has become holy because of its Rishis. We also teach the geography of other nations, but what we impart to them is its importance in the context of our country.\n\nAs with geography, so the history of the country is taught to the students of Bengal in a national context. We do not attach much importance to how many kings have ruled the country, which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>king</span> came to power in which year and how long his reign lasted or the date when the Battle of Plassey was fought. What we teach, rather, is how in ancient times the Aryans formed the nation, how today's Marathas became Marathas, how the Bengalis became Bengalis, how the Punjabis became Punjabis. Once the students have understood these things clearly, it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> if they fail to know the year of the Battle of Plassey. In short, we believe that true history is not really taught through the present-day Government's method of teaching.\n\nIn our national schools in Bengal, as with geography and history, so we teach philosophy based on the national system of education. We explain to the students in our national colleges in what regard our philosophy is greater and more comprehensive than other philosophies in the world. In Government schools the degree-holders know what Schopenhauer has to say, but they have hardly any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the spiritual foundations of our<span class='page-number' id='s-814' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.814]</span> own thought. It should also be seen that whatever philosophy the students learn in colleges, they should try to put into practice.\n\nNot that the system of National Education we have started is altogether new; it was started long ago by our forefathers. Through this system Shivaji's greatness will remain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span>, Asoka's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> and Akbar's glory will spread across the earth and the grandeur and majesty of our ancient Rishis will be made known throughout the world. From our National Education programmes, nothing useful or worthwhile is discarded.\n\nThis kind of national teaching is not provided in Government schools. In those schools the tender minds of our students are overburdened with the European way of thinking. But <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> and the European way of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> are quite different from our thought and our way of life. It is true, of course, that when we speak of the development of our own country, we cannot ignore the progress of modern <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>. In our reforms we must certainly include it; whatever is acceptable must be adapted suitably by us. But we have to guard against damaging our foundation in the process. We must make use of Western science as Japan did, but in implementing its ideas we must not be blind to the achievements of our forefathers. For example, in Government medical colleges the students remain unaware of our Ayurvedic science, though there are many occult and valuable truths behind it, to which the Western system has no access. This is not to assert that whatever is ours, is always the best.\n\nIn the field of politics we have a lot to learn from the West. The democratic system of government is one thing we must learn from the Europeans. In providing National Education, we do not isolate the students from the political field; in fact we give them first-hand experience of the democratic system of government by making them work alongside us. Simply concerning ourselves with industry or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> is not enough, and that is exactly what we tell them. No country can rise to its height merely on the basis of trade and commerce. We learn from history that those nations which grew on the strength of trade alone, have perished. Europe pays special attention to formulating policies<span class='page-number' id='s-815' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.815]</span> for the development and growth of its industry and commerce. Yet in our programme of National Education we do impart practical knowledge to our students. In our schools the students learn about science in depth and not just superficially. And they are taught many vocational subjects, such as carpentry and smithy, along with science. The result is that when a student comes out of our schools, he does not find it difficult to earn a monthly wage of twenty-five or thirty rupees.\n\nWhile imparting such a National Education in a national way, we place special emphasis on creating a future Indian nation. In planning our system of National Education we have to take into account various other systems of education. Principal Paranjape may speak of mathematics alone, but surely that is not enough. The one thought that impels us to provide National Education is this: When will this Indian nation occupy a place in the company of other nations? When will it be great among other nations in the world? Our learned and accomplished people must be great as people in other countries are great. This is always in our mind.\n\nIn our schools we give education up to the fifth standard in the mother-tongue of the students; teaching the children through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> is harmful. Some people object to the use of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>languages</span>, saying that our languages do not have an adequate vocabulary for teaching certain subjects. But our answer is simple: first experience it. The seventh standard in our national schools is equivalent to the intermediate courses conducted by the universities. In our colleges we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> a four-year course. A college student usually studies a single subject and for that purpose special emphasis is given to the use of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>. In spite of that, English is not given primary importance in the syllabus of our system of National Education; it has the status of a second language.\n\nA student must be able to stand on his own. It is not the objective of National Education to make somebody else carry him on his shoulders. The student must support himself and not look helplessly to others. Self-reliance is the basic principle we diligently try to impart to a student. This is how we have been<span class='page-number' id='s-816' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.816]</span> working in Bengal. We have absolutely no expectation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> from the Government in our endeavour. On the contrary, with Government support our nationalist enthusiasm will disappear.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Gokhale will now understand and appreciate just what we mean by National Education. This may also make it clear why we intended to put a specific resolution about National Education before the National Congress Committee at Surat. What has been done in Bengal I have put before you. If you wish to see for yourselves, you are welcome. Those who have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>doubts</span> in their minds, those who think that National Education is an impossibility, we challenge you to witness its achievements in Bengal. Come and confirm it for yourselves. National Education in a national way and under national control is what we have started in Bengal. In this work three zamindars have helped us greatly. Raja Subodh Chandra Mallik donated a lakh of rupees, the Maharaja of Mymensingh three lakhs and a zamindar from Gauripur five lakhs. When they offered these donations, they put the condition that they would take back the entire sum if we should accept even a single paisa from the Government. The reason is that when the Government spends <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> on education, it does so with the specific intention of creating a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> in the minds of the students. That attitude is nothing but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> to the Government. Besides, the Government has the intention of introducing public reforms primarily to prove its own good governance.<span class='page-number' id='s-817' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.817]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/national-education","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Speeches"}],"nxtt":"The Present Situation","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-present-situation","prvt":"Our Experiences in Bengal","prvu":"/cwsa/07/our-experiences-in-bengal","dt":"1908-01-15","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-present-situation"],"t":"The Present Situation","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Delivered in Bombay on 19 January 1908.

I accept that remark in the most reverent spirit, and before addressing you, I ask Him first to inspire me. I have been asked to speak on the \"Needs of the Present Situation\". What is the present situation? What is the situation of this country today? Just as I was coming in, this paper (*showing a copy of the* Bande Mataram *newspaper*) was put into my hands, and looking at the first page of it, I saw two items of news. \"The 'Yugantar' Trial, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Judgment</span> delivered, the Printer convicted and sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment.\" The other is \"Another Newspaper Prosecution, The 'Nabasakti' Office sacked and searched, Printer let out on a bail of Rs. 10,000.\" This is the situation of the country today. Do you realise what I mean? There is a creed in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> today which calls itself <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>, a creed which has come to you from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. This is a creed which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> of you have accepted, and you accepted it when you called yourselves Nationalists. Have you realised, have you yet realised what that means? Have you realised what it is that you have taken in hand? Or is it that you have merely accepted it in the pride of a superior intellectual conviction? You <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> yourselves Nationalists. What is Nationalism? Nationalism is not a mere political programme; Nationalism is a religion that has come from God; Nationalism is a creed in which you shall have to live. Let no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> dare to call himself a Nationalist if he does so merely with a sort of intellectual pride, thinking that he is more patriotic, thinking that he is something higher than those who do not call themselves by that name. If you are going to be a Nationalist, if<span class='page-number' id='s-818' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.818]</span> you are going to assent to this religion of Nationalism, you must do it in the religious spirit. You must remember that you are the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> of God for the salvation of your own country. You must live as the instruments of God.\n\nWhat is this that has happened in Bengal? You call yourselves Nationalists, but when this happens to you, what will you do? This thing is happening daily in Bengal, because, in Bengal, Nationalism has come to the people as a religion, and it has been accepted as a religion. But certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> which are against that religion are trying to crush its rising strength. It always happens when a new religion is preached, when God is going to be born in the people, that such forces rise with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> their weapons in their hands to crush this religion. In Bengal too a new religion, a religion <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> and sattwic has been preached, and this religion they are trying with all the weapons at their command to crush. By what strength are we in Bengal able to survive? Nationalism has not been crushed. Nationalism is not going to be crushed. Nationalism survives in the strength of God and it is not possible to crush it, whatever weapons are brought against it. Nationalism is immortal; Nationalism cannot die, because it is no human thing. It is God who is working in Bengal. God cannot be killed, God cannot be sent to jail. When these things happen among you, I say to you solemnly, what will you do? Will you do as they do in Bengal? (*Cries of \"Yes\"*) Don't lightly say \"Yes.\" It is a solemn thing. And suppose that God puts you this question, how will you answer it? Have you got a real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>? Or is it merely a political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>? Is it merely a larger kind of selfishness? Or is it merely that you wish to be free to oppress others, as you are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> oppressed? Do you hold your political creed from a higher source? Is it God that is born in you? Have you realised that you are merely the instruments of God, that your bodies are not your own? You are merely instruments of God for the work of the Almighty. Have you realised that? If you have realised that, then you are truly Nationalists; then alone will you be able to restore this great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. In Bengal it has been realised clearly by some, more clearly by others, but it has been realised and you on this side of the country must also realise it;<span class='page-number' id='s-819' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.819]</span> then there will be a blessing on our work, and this great nation will rise again and become once more what it was in the days of its spiritual greatness. (*Applause*) You are the instruments of God to save the light, to save the spirit of India from lasting obscuration and abasement.\n\nLet me tell you what it is that has happened in Bengal. You all know what Bengal used to be; you all know that \"Bengali\" used to be a term of reproach among the nations; when people spoke of Bengal, with what <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> did they speak of it? Was it with feelings of respect? Was it with feelings of admiration? You know very well what people of other countries used to say of the Bengali. You know well what you yourselves used to say of the Bengali. Do you think that now? If anybody had told you that Bengal would come forward as the saviour of India, how many of you would have believed it? You would have said, \"No. The saviour of India cannot be Bengal; it may be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span>; it may be Punjab; but it will not be Bengal; the idea is absurd.\" What has happened then? What has caused this change? What has made the Bengali so different from his old self? <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> thing has happened in Bengal, and it is this, that Bengal is learning to believe. Bengal was once drunk with the wine of European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> and with the purely intellectual teaching that it received from the West. It began to see all things, to judge all things through the imperfect instrumentality of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>. When it was so, Bengal became atheistic, it became a land of doubters and cynics. But still in Bengal there was an element of strength. Whatever the Bengali believed, if he believed at allâ€”many do not believeâ€”but if he believed at all, there was one thing about the Bengali, that he lived what he believed. If he was a Brahmo, or if he was a social reformer, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> whether what he believed was true or not, but if he believed, he lived that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>. If he believed that one thing was necessary for the salvation of the country, if he believed that a thing was true and that it should be done, he did not stop to think about it. He would not stop to consider from all intellectual standpoints whether the truth in it was merely an ideal and to balance whether he would do honestly what he believed or whether he could hold<span class='page-number' id='s-820' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.820]</span> the belief intellectually without living it, but without regard to consequences to himself, he went and did what he believed. And if he was not a Brahmo, if he was an orthodox Hindu, still if he really believed what the Hindu shastras taught then he never hesitated to drive even his dearest away, rather than aid by his weakness in corrupting society. He never hesitated to enforce what he believed to the uttermost without thinking of the consequences to himself.\n\nWell, what was the one saving element in the Bengali <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>? The Bengali has the faculty of belief. Belief is not a mere intellectual process, belief is not a mere persuasion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>, belief is something that is in our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, and what you believe, you must do, because belief is from God. It is to the heart that God speaks, it is in the heart that God resides. This saved the Bengali. Because of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of belief, we were chosen as the people who were to save India, the people who were to stand foremost, the people who must suffer for their belief, the people who must meet everything in the faith that God was with them and that God is in them. Such a people need not be politically strong, it need not be a people sound in physique, it need not be a people of the highest intellectual standing. It must be a people who can believe. In Bengal there came a flood of religious truth. Certain men were born, men whom the educated world would not have recognised if that belief, if that God within them had not been there to open their eyes, men whose lives were very different from what our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, our Western education, taught us to admire. One of them, the man who had the greatest influence and has done the most to regenerate Bengal, could not read and write a single word. He was a man who had been what they call absolutely useless to the world. But he had this one divine faculty in him, that he had more than faith and had realised God. He was a man who lived what many would call the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of a madman, a man without intellectual training, a man without any outward sign of culture or civilisation, a man who lived on the alms of others, such a man as the English-educated Indian would ordinarily talk of as one useless to society; even if he does not call him a bane to society, he will call him useless to society.<span class='page-number' id='s-821' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.821]</span> He will say, \"This man is ignorant. What does he know? What can he teach me who have received from the West all that it can teach?\" But God knew what he was doing. He sent that man to Bengal and set him in the temple of Dakshineshwar in Calcutta, and from North and South and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> and West, the educated men, men who were the pride of the university, who had studied all that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> can teach, came to fall at the feet of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>. The work of salvation, the work of raising India was begun.\n\nConsider the men who are really leading the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. One thing I will ask you to observe and that is that there are very few who have not been touched by the touch of the sadhu. If you ask who influenced Babu Bipin Chandra Pal, it was a sadhu. Among other men who lead in Bengal is the man who started this paper which is being prosecuted. He is also one of the leading men. You may not know his name here, but he is well-known throughout Bengal, and he had done much to forward this movement (*Cries of \"Bande Mataram*\"); he is a man who has lived the life of a sadhu, and taken his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and strength from that only source from which inspiration and strength can come. I spoke to you the other day about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span>, and I spoke of a man who had given his life to that work, the man who really organised the National College in Calcutta, and that man also is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disciple</span> of a sannyasin, that man also though he lives in the world lives like a sannyasin, and if you take the young workers in Bengal, men that have come forward to do the work of God, what will you find? What is their strength? What is the strength which enables them to bear all the obstacles that come in their way and to resist all the oppression that threatens them? Let me speak a word to you about that. There is a certain section of thought in India which regards Nationalism as \"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span>\". The men who think like that are men of great intellectual ability, men who have studied deeply, who have studied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>economics</span>, who have studied <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>, men who are entitled to respect, men from whom you would naturally accept leading and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>, and they say that Nationalism will ruin the country. What is it that makes them talk like this? Many of them are patriots, many of them are thoroughly sincere and honest, many of them<span class='page-number' id='s-822' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.822]</span> desire the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of the country. What is it that is wanting in them? This is wanting. They are men who have lived in the pure intellect only and they look at things purely from the intellectual standpoint. What does the intellect think? What must it tell you if you also consult the intellect merely? Here is a work that you have undertaken, a work so gigantic, so stupendous, the means for which are so poor, the resistance to which will be so strong, so organised, so disciplined, so well-equipped with all the weapons that science can supply, with all the strength that human power and authority can give, and what means have you with which to carry out this tremendous work of yours? If you look at it intellectually, and these men look at it from the intellectual standpoint, it is hopeless. Here are these men who are being prosecuted. How are they going to resist? They cannot resist. They have to go straight to jail. Well, these gentlemen argue and they are arguing straight from the intellect, they ask, \"How long will you be able to resist like that? How long will this passive resistance work? All your leaders, all your strong men will be sent to jail, you will be crushed, and not only will you be crushed, the nation will be completely crushed.\" If you argue from the intellect, this seems to be true. I cannot tell you of any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> weapon with which you will meet those who are commissioned to resist your creed of Nationalism when you try to live it. If you ask what material weapons we have got, I must tell you that material weapons may <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> you no doubt but if you rely wholly upon material weapons, then what they say is perfectly true, that Nationalism is a madness.\n\nOf course there is another side to it. If you say that Nationalism cannot avail, then again I ask the intellect of these people, what will avail? Intellectually speaking, speaking from the Moderates' standpoint, what will avail? What do they rely upon? They rely upon a foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> in the country. If you do not rely upon God, if you do not rely upon something mightier than material strength, then you will have to depend solely upon what others can give. There are men who think that what God cannot give for the salvation of India, the British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> will give. What you cannot expect from God, you are going to<span class='page-number' id='s-823' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.823]</span> expect from the British Government. Your expectation is vain. Their interests are not yours, their interests are very different from yours, and they will do what their interests tell them. You cannot expect anything else. What then does this intellectual process lead you to? This intellectual process, if it is used honestly, if it is followed to the very end, leads you to despair. It leads you to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>. You have nothing which can help you, because you have no material strength at present which the adversary cannot crush, and the adversary will certainly not be so foolish as to help you, or to allow you to develop the necessary strength unmolested. What then is the conclusion? The only conclusion is that there is nothing to be done. The only conclusion is that this country is doomed. That is the conclusion to which this intellectual process will lead you.\n\nI was speaking at Poona on this subject, and I told them of my experience in Bengal. When I went to Bengal three or four years before the Swadeshi movement was born, to see what was the hope of revival, what was the political condition of the people, and whether there was the possibility of a real movement, what I found there was that the prevailing mood was apathy and despair. People had believed that regeneration could only come from outside, that another nation would take us by the hand and lift us up and that we have nothing to do for ourselves. Now that belief has been thoroughly broken. They had come to realise that help cannot come from this source, and then they had nothing to rely upon. Their intellects could not tell them of any other source from which help could come, and the result was that apathy and despair spread everywhere, and most of the workers who were really honest with themselves were saying that there was no help for this nation and that we were doomed. Well, this state of despair was the best thing that could have happened for Bengal, for it meant that the intellect had done its best, that the intellect had done all that was possible for it, and that the work of the unaided intellect in Bengal was finished. The intellect having nothing to offer but despair became quiescent, and when the intellect ceased to work, the heart of Bengal was open and ready to receive the voice of God whenever<span class='page-number' id='s-824' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.824]</span> He should speak. When the message came at last, Bengal was ready to receive it and she received it in a single moment, and in a single moment the whole nation rose, the whole nation lifted itself out of delusions and out of despair, and it was by this sudden rising, by this sudden awakening from dream that Bengal found the way of salvation and declared to all India that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> and not lasting degradation was our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span>. (*Applause*) Bengal lived in that faith. She felt a mightier truth than any that earth can give, because she held that faith from God and was able to live in that faith.\n\nThen that happened which always happens when God brings other forces to fight against the strength which He Himself has inspired. Because it is always necessary for the divinely appointed strength to grow by suffering; without suffering, without the lesson of selflessness, without the moral force of self-sacrifice, God within us cannot grow. Sri <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span> cannot grow to manhood unless he is called upon to work for others, unless the Asuric forces of the world are about him and work against him and make him feel his strength. Therefore in Bengal there came a time, after the first outbreak of triumphant hope, when all the material forces that can be brought to bear against Nationalism were gradually brought into play, and the question was asked of Bengal, \"Can you suffer? Can you survive?\" The young men of Bengal who had rushed forward in the frenzy of the moment, in the inspiration of the new gospel they had received, rushed forward rejoicing in the new-found strength and expecting to bear down all obstacles that came in their way, were now called upon to suffer. They were called upon to bear the crown, not of victory, but of martyrdom. They had to learn the real nature of their new strength. It was not their own strength, but it was the force which was working through them, and they had to learn to be the instruments of that force.\n\nWhat is it that we have learned then? What is the need of the situation of which I am to tell you today? It is not a political programme. I have spoken to you about many things. I have written about many things, about Swadeshi, Boycott, National Education, Arbitration and other subjects. But there was one<span class='page-number' id='s-825' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.825]</span> truth that I have always tried, and those who have worked with me have also tried to lay down as the foundation stone of all that we preached. It is not by any mere political programme, not by National Education alone, not by Swadeshi alone, not by Boycott alone, that this country can be saved. Swadeshi by itself may merely lead to a little more material prosperity, and when it does, you might lose sight of the real thing you sought to do in the glamour of wealth, in the attraction of wealth and in the desire to keep it safe. In other subject countries also, there was material development; under the Roman Empire there was material development, there was industrial progress, but industrial progress and material development did not bring life to the nation. When the hour of trial came, it was found that these nations which had been developing industrially, which had been developing materially, were not alive. No, they were dead and at a touch from outside they crumbled to pieces. So, do not think that it is any particular programme or any particular method which is the need of the situation. These are merely ways of working; they are merely particular concrete lines upon which the spirit of God is working in a nation, but they are not in themselves the one thing needful.\n\nWhat is the one thing needful? What is it that has helped the older men who have gone to prison? What is it that has been their strength, that has enabled them to stand against all temptations and against all dangers and obstacles? They have had one and all of them consciously or unconsciously one overmastering idea, one idea which nothing can shake, and this was the idea that there is a great power at work to help India, and that we are doing what it bids us. Often they do not understand what they are doing. They do not always realise who guides or where he will <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> them; but they have this conviction within, not in the intellect but in the heart, that the power that is guiding them is invincible, that it is almighty, that it is an immortal and irresistible power and that it will do its work. They have nothing to do. They have simply to obey that power. They have simply to go where it leads them. They have only to speak the words that it tells them to speak, and to do the thing that it tells them<span class='page-number' id='s-826' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.826]</span> to do. If the finger points them to prison, to the prison they go. Whatever it bids them to endure, they gladly endure. They do not know how that enduring will help, and the worldly-wise people may tell them that it is impolitic, that by doing this they will be wasting the strength of the country, they will be throwing the best workers away, they are not saving up the forces of the country. But we know that the forces of the country are other than outside forces. There is only one force, and for that force, I am not necessary, you are not necessary, he is not necessary. Neither myself nor another, nor Bipin Chandra Pal, nor all these workers who have gone to prison. None of them is necessary. Let them be thrown as so much waste substance, the country will not suffer. God is doing everything. We are not doing anything. What He bids us suffer, we suffer because the suffering is necessary to give others strength. When He throws us away, He does so because we are no longer required. If things become worse, we shall have not only to go to jail, but give up our lives and if those who seem to stand in front or to be absolutely indispensable are called upon to throw their bodies away, we shall then know that that also is wanted, that this is a work that God has asked us to do, and that in the place of those who are thrown away, God will bring many more. He Himself is behind us. He Himself is the worker and the work. (*Applause*) He is immortal in the hearts of His people. Faith then is what we have in Bengal. Some of us may not have it consciously; some may not call it by that particular name. As I said, we have developed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellectuality</span>, we have developed it notably and we are still much dominated by it. Many have come to this belief through the longing to live for their countrymen, to suffer for their countrymen, because God is not only here in me, He is within all of you; it is God whom I <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, it is God for whom I wish to suffer. (*Applause*) In that way many have come to do what God bade them do and He knows which way to lead a man. When it is His will, He will lead him aright.\n\nAnother thing, which is only another name for faith, is selflessness. This movement in Bengal, this movement of Nationalism is not guided by any self-interest, not at the heart of<span class='page-number' id='s-827' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.827]</span> it. Whatever there may be in some minds, it is not, at the heart of it, a political self-interest that we are pursuing. It is a religion which we are trying to live. It is a religion by which we are trying to realise God in the nation, in our fellow-countrymen. We are trying to realise Him in the three hundred millions of our people. We are trying, some of us consciously, some of us unconsciously, we are trying to live not for our own interests, but to work and to die for others. When a young worker in Bengal has to go to jail, when he is asked to suffer, he does not feel any pang in that suffering, he does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> suffering. He goes forward with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span>. He says, The hour of my <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consecration</span> has come, and I have to thank God now that the time for laying myself on His altar has arrived and that I have been chosen to suffer for the good of my countrymen. This is the hour of my greatest joy and the fulfilment of my life. (*Loud applause*) This is the second aspect of our religion, and is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> denial of the idea of one's separate self, and the finding of one's higher eternal Self in the three hundred millions of people in whom God Himself lives.\n\nThe third thing, which is again another name for faith and selflessness, is courage. When you believe in God, when you believe that God is guiding you, believe that God is doing all and that you are doing nothing, what is there to fear? How can you fear when it is your creed, when it is your religion, to throw yourself away, to throw your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span>, your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>, your life and all that you have, away for others? What is it that you have to fear? There is nothing to fear. Even when you are called before the tribunals of this world, you can face them with courage. Because your very religion means that you have courage. Because it is not you, it is something within you. What can all these tribunals, what can all the powers of the world do to that which is within you, that Immortal, that Unborn and Undying One, whom the sword cannot pierce, whom the fire cannot burn, whom the water cannot drown? Him the jail cannot confine and the gallows cannot end. What is there that you can fear when you are conscious of Him who is within you? Courage is then a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>, courage is natural and courage is inevitable. If you rely upon other forces, supposing that you are a Nationalist in<span class='page-number' id='s-828' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.828]</span> the European sense, meaning in a purely materialistic sense, that is to say, if you want to replace the dominion of the foreigner by the dominion of somebody else, it is a purely material change; it is not a religion, it is not that you feel for the three hundred millions of your countrymen, that you want to raise them up, that you want to make them all free and happy. It is not that, but you have got some idea that your nation is different from another nation and that these people are outsiders and that you ought to be ruling in their place. What you want is not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> for your countrymen, but you want to replace the rule of others by yours. If you go in that spirit, what will happen when a time of trial comes? Will you have courage? Will you face it? You will see that is merely an intellectual conviction that you have, that is merely a reason which your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>outer mind</span> suggests to you. Well, when it comes to be put to the test, what will your mind say to you? What will your intellect say to you? It will tell you, It is all very well to work for the country, but, in the meanwhile, I am going to die, or at least to be given a great deal of trouble, and when the fruit is reaped, I shall not be there to enjoy it. How can I bear all this suffering for a dream? You have this house of yours, you have this property, you have so many things which will be attacked, and so you say, That is not the way for me. If you have not the divine strength of faith and unselfishness, you will not be able to escape from other attachments, you will not like to bear affliction simply for the sake of a change by which you will not profit. How can courage come from such a source? But when you have a higher idea, when you have realised that you have nothing, that you are nothing and that the three hundred millions of people of this country are God in the nation, something which cannot be measured by so much land, or by so much money, or by so many lives, you will then realise that it is something immortal, that the idea for which you are working is something immortal and that it is an immortal power which is working in you. All other attachments are nothing. Every other consideration disappears from your mind, and, as I said, there is no need to cultivate courage. You are led on by that power. You are protected through life and death by One who survives.<span class='page-number' id='s-829' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.829]</span> In the very hour of death, you feel your immortality. In the hour of your worst sufferings, you feel you are invincible.\n\nNow I have told you that these three things are the need of the present situation, because, as I said, the situation is this: You have undertaken a work, you have committed yourselves to something which seems to be materially impossible. You have undertaken a work which will raise the mightiest enemies whom the earth can bring forward. As in the ancient time, when the Avatars came, there were also born the mightiest Daityas and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asuras</span> to face the Avatars, so it always is. You may be sure that if you embrace this religion of Nationalism, you will have to meet such tremendous forces as no mere material power can resist. The hour of trial is not distant, the hour of trial is already upon you. What will be the use of your intellectual conviction? What will be the use of your outward enthusiasm? What will be the use of your shouting \"Bande Mataram\"? What will be the use of all the mere outward show when the hour of trial comes? Put yourselves in the place of those people who are suffering in Bengal, and think whether they have the strength, and whether, if it comes to you, you have the strength to meet it. With what strength shall we meet it? How can we work invincibly? How can we meet it and survive? Can you answer that question? I have tried to show you that not by your material strength can you meet it. Have you the other strength in you? Have you realised what Nationalism is? Have you realised that it is a religion that you are embracing? If you have, then call yourselves Nationalists; and when you have called yourselves Nationalists, then try to live your Nationalism. Try to realise the strength within you, try to bring it forward so that everything you do may be not your own doing, but the doing of that Truth within you. Try so that every hour that you live shall be enlightened by that presence, that every thought of yours shall be inspired from that one fountain of inspiration, that every faculty and quality in you may be placed at the service of that immortal power within you. Then you will not say, as I have heard so many of you say, that people are so slow to take up this idea, that people are so slow to work, that you have no fit leaders,<span class='page-number' id='s-830' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.830]</span> and that all your great men tell you a different thing and none of them is ready to come forward to guide you in the path that is pointed out. You will have no complaints to make against others, because then you will not need any leader. The leader is within yourselves. If you can only find Him and listen to His voice, then you will not find that people will not listen to you, because there will be a voice within the people which will make itself heard. That voice and that strength is within you. If you feel it within yourselves, if you live in its presence, if it has become yourselves, then you will find that one word from you will awake an answering voice in others, that the creed which you preach will spread and will be received by all and that it will not be very long, as in Bengal it has not been very long, it has not taken a century or fifty years, it has only taken three years to change the whole nation, to give it a new spirit and a new heart and to put it in front of all the Indian races. From Bengal has come the creed of Nationalism, and from Bengal has come the example of Nationalism. Bengal which was the least respected and the most looked down on of all the Indian races for its weakness has within these three years changed so much, simply because the men there who were called to receive God within themselves were able to receive Him, were able to bear, to suffer and to live in that Power, and by living in that Power, they were able to give it out. And so in three years the whole race of Bengal has been changed, and you are obliged to ask in wonder, \"What is going on in Bengal?\" You see a movement which no obstacle can stop, you see a great development which no power can resist, you see the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Avatar</span> in the nation, and if you have received God within you, if you have received that Power within you, you will see that God will change the rest of India in even a much shorter time, because the Power has already gone forth, and is declaring itself, and when once declared, it will continue its work with ever greater and greater rapidity. It will continue its work with the matured force of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divinity</span> until the whole world sees and until the whole world understands Him, until Sri Krishna who has now hid Himself in Gokul, who is now among the poor and despised of the earth, who is now among<span class='page-number' id='s-831' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.831]</span> the cow-herds of Brindaban, will reveal Himself, will declare the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Godhead</span>, and the whole nation will rise, the whole people of this great country will rise, filled with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine power</span>, filled with the inspiration of the Almighty, and no power on earth shall resist it, and no danger or difficulty shall stop it in its onward course. (*Loud and continued applause*) Because God is there, and it is His Mission, and He has something for us to do. He has a work for His great and ancient nation. Therefore He has been born again to do it, therefore He is revealing Himself in you, not that you may be like other nations, not that you may rise merely by human strength to trample underfoot the weaker peoples, but because something must come out from you which is to save the whole world. That something is what the ancient Rishis knew and revealed, and that is to be known and revealed again today, it has to be revealed to the whole world, and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that He may reveal Himself, you must first realise Him in yourselves, you must shape your lives, you must shape the life of this great nation so that it may be fit to reveal Him and then your task will be done, and you will realise that what you are doing today is no mere political uprising, no mere political change, but that you have been called upon to do God's work.

Swaraj means <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> of affairs in a country by her own people on their own strength in accordance with the welfare of the people without even nominal suzerainty, which is the object which we wish to attain. We had forgotten it for a time and feared to speak about it. We were far away from the truth and we had forgotten it, and on that account we have been reduced to a bad condition. If we do not acquaint ourselves with the object in view, viz., Swaraj, I am afraid we, thirty crores of people, will become extinct. The people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span> must<span class='page-number' id='s-833' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.833]</span> have some recollection of Swaraj, because a century ago you represented it.\n\nSwaraj is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, it is nectar and salvation. Swaraj in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> is the breath of life. Without breath of life a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> is dead. So also without Swaraj a nation is dead. Swaraj <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> the life of a nation it is essential for it. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>History</span> shows the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of nations without Swaraj. In ancient times the Romans had extended their sovereignty over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> countries as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> has done at present, and under their sovereignty the people of other countries enjoyed as we are now enjoying <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the comforts of a peaceful reign. Their lives and properties were all secure as ours are, but in spite of all this, it was said that the people under the sway of the Roman Empire came to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> with its downfall, and were harassed by savage people. The reason is, they had no Swaraj. After a lapse of centuries they stood on their own legs and established for themselves Swaraj and became happy. It is for this reason that Swaraj is essentially needed, and is to be gained by our own exertions. If it is gained otherwise, which is impossible, it cannot last long for want of strength in us. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> way of gaining it is to implore the sovereign, who holds our realm, but he won't give it. Unfortunately there still exists a party of men who still cling to the idea that we shall obtain Swaraj by asking for it, which is to be regretted. This party thinks that we are not capable of managing our own affairs, that we are being trained in that direction and that our benign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> will extend Swaraj to us by degrees. But they do not understand that it is against <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span></span>â€”Indians excepted. The English value the importance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. Its possession gives them status. If they once allow India to slip from their grasp, they will become a nonentity. Under such circumstances it is silly to say that the English will train us and entrust us with Swaraj. By reposing confidence in the English people we are already reduced to a miserable condition and in the end will become extinct. Another way of obtaining Swaraj is to seek aid from a neighbouring nation. But this means jumping from the frying-pan into the fire. No <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> from whom we seek assistance their own interests will first be considered. We should, therefore, acquire it by our own efforts.<span class='page-number' id='s-834' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.834]</span>\n\nThe question therefore arises as to how we should do it. We do not possess Swaraj nor have we the power to retain it. The answer is, we cannot <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of swimming unless we struggle in the water. We should, therefore, be prepared to undergo hardships in the struggle for Swaraj, as there is no other alternative. We want Swaraj, which means independence, but independence cannot be had unless we are independent. As God created us independent we should be full of inspirations. With full <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in God we should preach independence through the length and breadth of the country and a beginning should be made to impart national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. The English erred in the beginning in spreading their education, which they now regret, and on this account <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> adopted a new policy. People should take into their own hands judicial and executive work. They should get their disputes settled by arbitration. Look at the change which has been wrought during the past two years by the Swadeshi movement and boycott. With these two measures we are bound to obtain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> results. We, Bengalis, have adopted all these measures and have been successful. If these measures are universally adopted, we shall have more than half of Swaraj in our hands. The opposition will not sleep over it. It's all known in England. Our idea of the struggle for Swaraj is that it is the commandment of God, which we must obey. To oppose it is not in our power. That Bengalis inspired with this idea do not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> fine, incarceration, deportation or the extreme penalty of the law, is a well-known <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>. If a Bengali lad is punished in connection with the Swadeshi movement, he smiles and says it does not matter much; we have gone another step in the direction of our goal.\n\nO inhabitants of Maharashtra, since you and Bengalis are stirring to attain one end and as we are all sons of Aryabhumi, let us all jointly set ourselves to the task of bringing about a state of things in accordance with the commandment of God. We, Bengalis, depend upon you because the sons of Maharashtra were brave soldiers a short while ago. You enjoyed Swaraj when you were harassed by Mahomedans. A similar commandment was conveyed to you through Tukaram, Ramdas and others,<span class='page-number' id='s-835' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.835]</span> and in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to this commandment all Marathas joined. Shivaji, the warrior, came from you, and Swaraj was established in Maharashtra. The poor were rescued from molestation by the wicked and the country prospered. The present state of affairs is similar. The present agitation is not the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of man. It is divine inspiration. It is the commandment of God. Human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> are the instruments to carry it out. There must be unity among us and we are getting united. If we, thirty crores of people, unite with a firm resolution for the sake of truth, the commandment of God and His will will be done and the foe will share the fate of the mountain of ashes which disappeared with a strong current of wind. We are all God's creatures, and if all from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) are brought together, it will be seen that our country is just as big as it is described in our *kavyas*.

They are, first, Swadeshi; second, boycott; third, Swaraj; and fourth, national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. Swadeshi is the method, the way, the road by which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> advances. Boycott is only the other side of Swadeshi, and both the Swadeshi and the boycott movements are actually encouraged in principle in the greater part of this country. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>National education</span> is the training of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the younger generation.

Our political efforts are directed to Swadeshi, boycott, Swaraj and national education, which have been recognised by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>.\n\nToday I wish to speak to you about two of these subjects because they go together. Swadeshi and boycott, as we understand them in Bengal, have been put as a single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. There is no difference of opinion in Bengal as regards Swadeshi and boycott. Both parties entirely agree that boycott is an essential part of political progress. When we speak of Swadeshi, we ought clearly to understand the meaning of the word. Swadeshi is the preference for articles produced by Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> itself. The use and consumption of such articles defines the Swadeshi <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. When we speak of boycott, it is generally understood that boycott is the determination to exclude foreign products, the determination not to use articles of foreign manufacture.\n\nNow the meaning of Swadeshi and boycott, as we Nationalists understand them, is wider and larger than Swadeshi and boycott as defined by others, owing to the commercial and industrial circumstances of the country. There are three kinds<span class='page-number' id='s-837' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.837]</span> of Swadeshi. When Swadeshi was first started in Bengal, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> Minto said at the Commercial Exhibition in Calcutta that he approved of Swadeshi. Our Swadeshi, according to Lord Minto, is the determination to encourage Indian manufacture and the use of Indian goods when they are as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> manufactures and can be got at a cheaper price. That is the economic principle preached by English economists. Lord Minto says that if Swadeshi excludes the goods of other countries it ceases to be an honest attempt for the industry of this country. There is another kind of Swadeshi which is more developed. We shall encourage Indian labour, Indian manufacture, Indian articles, preferring our own goods by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> them a little stimulus. This idea of Swadeshi brings in the principle of preference and protection. The third kind of Swadeshi adopts the principle of using our own Indian manufactures, our own Indian goods, and not using foreign articles if Indian articles can be had. These are the three kinds of Swadeshi and the third kind of Swadeshi absolutely depends upon the boycott.\n\nBoycott, it is objected, brings in an element of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, political struggle and of political animosity. Boycott has a double aspect. There is a commercial boycott which is used as a political weapon. It is not open to the charge that it brings in animosity, hatred and political struggle. The management of our own country is not in our hands. It is in the hands of a people whose trade interests are opposed to ours. The management is in the hands of a people who have adopted the doctrine of free trade, an unalterable principle which they are not going to sacrifice for any reason. It is the principle of free trade which has been unanimously adopted by Englishmen. They want free trade. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> gets every advantage of free trade. But other countries cannot accept the principle of free trade. This is not an expression of political hatred of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> nation to another. Boycott is not an expression of political hatred but a means of self-defence. The Governments of countries such as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> declare that they will not use English tea. We want tea produced and developed in our own country; therefore we want to pass a law that no English tea is to be brought in unless it pays a heavy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-838' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.838]</span> But the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> in India is not in our hands and it is not for our protection. Therefore the only remedy, the only weapon is to boycott foreign goods. We are simply following the same policy as other Governments. We will not use the manufactured articles of Manchester. We want to develop the cotton industry in India. The whole of India will be employed for producing our own goods. We shall not use Manchester goods at all; we shall use goods produced and manufactured in our country. The object of the boycott of foreign goods is self-protection. When boycott comes by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> of a nation and by an effort of its people, it protects the trade of the country. Every nation has a right to protect its life from starvation and famine, just as everyone is entitled to the right of self-defence. It is the exercise of a natural right which no one can prevent. It is allowed by the principles of political economy and there is no law and there can be no law to prevent this. This is a perfectly legitimate duty allowed by the law and sanctioned by the principles of political economy. There is nothing to be afraid of, if we follow these principles.\n\nThere is another aspect of boycottâ€”the political aspect. Certain people think that commercial boycott is not possible and is contrary to the principles of economy, but that boycott can be used as a political weapon. Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> holds that opinion and he strongly supported the principle of boycott at the Benares Congress. He said that the boycott of all foreign goods is not possible, but he thought that this political boycott will be effective in bringing a redress of certain grievances of our country.\n\nThis political use of boycott has special relation to the Partition of Bengal. It is proved that in Bengal boycott was first declared as a protest against the Partition; it was declared when there was a great agitation in Bengal. Meetings were held to protest against the Partition; petitions were presented but with no success. When there was no remedy left, somebody suggested that boycott would be very good and the whole of Bengal accepted boycott. It was accepted by leaders who were of all political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>. Meetings were held and the leaders of the Moderate parties accepted it as a political weapon, as a means<span class='page-number' id='s-839' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.839]</span> of bringing pressure upon the British Government to annul the Partition. Everything had failed, our petitions and protests were not heard, so we wanted to bring pressure upon the British people. We thought that boycott was the only pressure which told upon the pockets and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> interests of England. This was the idea which was approved by all in Bengal, and boycott was first adopted in Bengal for a period of six months as a form of political agitation. If it was successful, boycott would become a prominent part of our political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. But since the British public might feel that after six months we would give up, a sort of proviso was attached: we would boycott British goods until the Partition was rescinded. But when the leaders signed and returned the paper, that proviso was crossed out and they all took oath without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> of time or proviso. What induced them? Why should they strike out the proviso? The reason was that we in Bengal held that boycott was not really a political weapon, but was something wider and deeper. It was about national activity, which had nothing to do with the Partition. Partition was an exciting cause. It was merely the blow which opened our eyes suddenly. It induced the people enthusiastically, unanimously to seize upon the boycott.\n\nI have told you that Swadeshi and boycott are the road, the way which leads to the goal. Swadeshi and boycott are the way to the goal of Swaraj. There has been much discussion about the definition of Swaraj. Swaraj has been defined as self-government. It has been defined by Dadabhai <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Naoroji</span> as a self-governing colony. In our view, self-government is merely one aspect of Swaraj. We believe that India itself is entirely a separate nation. As a nation it is not part of the Anglo-Saxons. When we speak of Swaraj we mean the principle of national life independent of any form of government. The word Swaraj is not a new word but an old one. It is as old as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. The meaning of Swaraj, in our ancient literature, is the spiritual condition of the soul which attains to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mukti</span>. When the soul is independent of everything but itself, when it exists in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>joy</span> of its light and greatness, when it is Mukta, that is Swaraj. According to our ancient philosophy, *sarvam paravasham duhkham sarvam<span class='page-number' id='s-840' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.840]</span> atmavasham sukham*: All dependence upon others is misery; all dependence upon ourselves is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>. This is the fundamental truth. To get rid of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>, bondage, is the ideal of our ancient religion. It is the sole object of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, human life.\n\nLet us apply the word Swaraj to national life. The national soul <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> a reformed life. The national self is our Swaraj. The national self magnifies the national soul, that is, the soul of three hundred millions. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the world teaches us that when a nation is dependent it begins to decay, it begins to lose its power; it loses its strength, it loses its manhood and lastly it is broken to pieces and becomes weak and helpless. This is what history teaches us and what reason tells us. Our nation does not depend upon itself but depends upon others; therefore it is in an unsound, unhealthy and diseased condition. The end of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> and if the nation consents to that disease it will decay and death is certain. Before the Swadeshi movement was started, we were in a state of perfect dependence. Even now, the entire management of our country is in the hands of foreigners; we have become absolutely like Fakirs; we have become dependent upon foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span>. The management of India is entirely directed by others; we have to look to a foreign nation for our life. The whole life of India would come to a standstill if our food ran short. Sugar, salt and such articles of daily use would be cut off; we would be reduced to a condition never seen before in the history of our country. We have now to look to a foreign nation for our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, for what is right and wrong, for the best things to learn. By a foreign way of living, by a foreign education we have sought to cease to be Indians, to adopt a new way of life. That was the condition and tendency before the Swadeshi movement was started. Now the boycott is not essentially a political movement, it is a movement of old times; it is the movement to recover the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of a nation, a national life; it is the desire to live for ourselves. That is the meaning of Swaraj; that is called Swadeshi. It is an intellectual change, it is a spiritual change, it is a political change. National independence is Swaraj. Swadeshi is that which belongs to our own country. When applied to industry and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> it means<span class='page-number' id='s-841' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.841]</span> the preference for our own articles produced by Indian labour and the exclusion of articles produced by the labour of foreign people.\n\n*National education*:â€”The object of our educational movement is to establish self-government in India. It is an education which shall create Indians, not Englishmen, citizens of the Indian nation; this will prolong the life of India. It means gradually giving up schools and colleges under foreign control, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of which are directed by a foreign element. The schools and colleges in which we are taught give us an education which does not develop our intellectual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>. Education in English schools and colleges has cut us off from our ancient strength; it is an education which does not fit our ancient strength. The education we receive is narrow, meagre and incomplete. We want to establish an education of our own in India.\n\nNew movements in Bengal are slowly coming forward one by one. The movement in Bengal took the idea of boycott and applied it to foreign education. Our education is based on Swadeshi. It seeks to establish an educational system which springs from our ancient system so that we do not ruin ourselves, pecuniarily, morally and intellectually, as well as physically. There is also a movement of arbitration, a movement to establish arbitration courts to settle disputes among ourselves, instead of going to law-courts managed under foreign laws. We seek to settle disputes among ourselves in preference to the present costly system, which is doing harm to our nation. Both these movements seek to develop our national energies and the habit of independence; that is the real meaning of Swadeshi as we understand it in Bengal.\n\nI am addressing you in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English language</span>. I am an Indian. You are all Indians. I am trying to preach to the nation certain ideas which will bring prosperity to our country. I got my education in England, and so I can express my thoughts best in English. It shows how unnatural was our life which existed in the nineteenth century. When I speak in English, a foreign language, a certain number will understand me, a certain number will partly understand and a certain number will not understand at<span class='page-number' id='s-842' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.842]</span> all. Those who speak in a foreign language, are not really able to throw themselves out in that language because that language is not their own. There are some people in Bengal who speak no other language than English; this shows how unnatural our way of life has become. This is the result of foreign dependence. Now in Bengal, after the Swadeshi movement, if a speaker rises to speak, he has to speak in Bengali. If he begins in any other language, he is commanded by the audience to speak in Bengali. We are Swadeshi, we want you to speak in Swadeshi language, we want our things Swadeshi; we want that which belongs to us. We want to boycott the things which do not belong to our country. We don't want foreign government, we want a state of independence. By our medium of expression we shall also be Swadeshi or Bideshi. When we understand the principle of Swadeshi, then we will come to understand what boycott means. It is not hatred; it is not animosity against foreign rulers; it is the other side of Swadeshi.\n\nIf you want to realise yourselves, seek for yourselves. If you realise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Atman</span>, the real self, you realise the Anatman the not-self. We don't want anything which is Anatman, and that is boycott. This principle applies to a nation. We have to recover our national independence and for that we want our nation realised. We want to realise our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationalism</span>. It is boycott which leads to national self-realisation, and it is the ideal of Swaraj. It is neither wrong nor illegal but a perfectly legitimate movement, a movement which no law can deny. The ideal of Swaraj is not an ideal which the law can prevent; there can be no human law to prevent it. If you have your own schools and not those that are managed by foreign control, it is not illegal. If I preach to you to boycott foreign schools, there is nothing unlawful in it. You should not go to foreign law-courts. If I preach to you to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> your own countrymen, to take your own measures to supply water to your villages, there is nothing illegal or immoral. There is nothing in the word boycott that you need be afraid of. There are people who seek to stop this movement because it affects their interests. We preach passive resistance in Bengal. Whatever obstacles are thrown in your<span class='page-number' id='s-843' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.843]</span> way, whatever sufferings are inflicted on you, remove those obstacles, bear those sufferings, bear the affliction and go on with your movement, go on with your activities with all your <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>. You young men must live for nationalism. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to preach passive resistance let nothing stop you. Keep your resolution; never mind the obstacles. Never mind the stumbles and pitfalls that will come in your way. Welcome joy or sorrow, welcome victory or defeat.\n\nIf you have not the courage of self-sacrifice, then do not talk of Swadeshi. If you don't want to sacrifice, if you want to lie in your armchairs and you think you can save your nation thereby, then you have no right to come forward. It is no use your coming in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span>. Swadeshi, boycott, Swaraj and national education are not at all immoral, illegal or unnatural. The national movement is such that you will live to save your own country. You are asked to save your nation of three hundred million people and you are asked to live a Swadeshi life, not for yourselves but for your country. I ask you to be Swadeshi. Try to buy Swadeshi goods. I ask you to mould your life on Swadeshi. Live for your Swadeshi and die for your Swadeshi.<span class='page-number' id='s-844' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.844]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/swadeshi-and-boycott","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Speeches"}],"nxtt":"Bande Mataram","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/bande-mataram","prvt":"The Meaning of Swaraj","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-meaning-of-swaraj","dt":"1908-01-26","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["bande-mataram"],"t":"Bande Mataram","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Delivered in Amravati on 29 January 1908.

He described the manner in which the mantra had been revealed to Bankim Chandra, probably by a sannyasi under whose teaching he was. He said that the mantra was not an invention, but a revivification of the old mantra which became extinct so to speak by the treachery of one Navakisan. The mantra of Bankim Chandra was not appreciated in his own day and he predicted that there would come a time when the whole of India would resound with the singing of the song, and the word of the prophet was miraculously fulfilled. The meaning of the song was not understood then because there was no patriotism, except such as consisted in making India the shadow of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and other countries, which dazzled the sight of the sons of this our motherland with their glory and opulence. The so-called patriots of that time might have been the well-wishers of India but not certainly ones who loved her. One who loved his mother never looked to her defects, never disregarded her as an ignorant, superstitious, degraded and decrepit woman. The speaker then unfolded the meaning of the song. As with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>, so with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, there were three bodies or Koshas, the Sthula, Sukshma and Karana Shariras. In this way the speaker went<span class='page-number' id='s-845' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.845]</span> on clearing up the hidden meaning of the song.

Several partisan papers have already begun to pass remarks such as \"The Nationalist party assembled at Surat solely with the purpose of breaking up the Congress\", \"It did not want the Congress\", and \"It had a premeditated intention of wrecking it.\" But I ask you, What advantage would the Nationalist party derive from destroying the Congress? The Nationalist party wanted the Congress; we required it for the purpose of disseminating our nationalist views.

Who sent that wire? The leaders of the Nationalist party in Bengalâ€”our leadersâ€”are the very headquarters of Nationalism. From this standpoint, which of our headquarters had been left behind? If we regard the leaders as the headquarters, one of them is at Buxar at present<span class='page-number' id='s-847' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.847]</span> and the other was at Surat! No such telegram was received by the Nationalist party. The above statement is entirely false. The Nationalist party did not want to wreck the Congress and it never did. I do not blame anyone. But I ask, What were we to gain by wrecking the Congress? It was not the case that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> would have been displeased if we severed our connection with the other party by wrecking the Congress. Where did we get the desire to rally round the British flag by cutting off our connection with the other party? If we consider the three issues raised in the debate of this year's Congress, it will be possible to decide who was responsible for the wrecking of the Congress.\n\nEvery member of any public institution started and managed by the people of any civilised nation is given full liberty to offer his opinion on any question, in accordance with the universally acknowledged rules of all public institutions. No president has the authority to suppress this libertyâ€”this natural right of every member of society. The president is merely a servant of the meeting formed by the coming together of the people who appoint him. There are rules to regulate his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span>. No president should break these rules. He cannot stifle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of speech and liberty of opinion. When such is the universally acknowledged rule, who then tried to snatch away the rights of a member? Was it the Nationalist party or the other party? Who transgressed the universally accepted rule of meetings by not allowing the leader of our party to speak, though timely notice was given by him? Did we do this? Those who say that we went to the Congress with the intention of wrecking it should think over this question.\n\nAnother important thing is that the Congress is an institution belonging to all Indiansâ€”to all the well-wishers of the nation. Whoever exerts himself for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of the nation ought to get a place in this institution. Whoever has to push forward the cart of the nation, whoever is desirous of procuring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> and as much liberty as is possible for his country to get, ought to be able to enter this institution. The ideal of one may be less exalted, while that of another more exalted, and that of the third most exalted. But since \"the good of the nation\" is the common object of all, everyone ought to be included in that institution.<span class='page-number' id='s-848' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.848]</span> One party may defeat the other on the strength of a majority of votes and establish its own superiority. If the other party has any stamina or mettle, it will live and fight. But none should try to drive away any party from the institution by taking advantage of a local majority formed according to his own wishes. It is clear that the other party had the majority at Surat. Was it not the attempt of the Moderate party to drive the Nationalist party out of the Congress from next year by taking advantage of this local majority? Why should the opinion of one party that such is the particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> of our nation be fastened on to the other party? It is not that the ultimate aim of our political agitation should be one and the same for all. One may be in advance of the other. Was it not a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that in the resolution of this year's constitution they were going to fasten on the Nationalist party a \"final goal\" which was unacceptable to it? It is a mockery of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> of the Nationalists to make them sign a paper containing false principles of Nationalism which are not acceptable to them. Who has the right to thrust his own idea of the \"final goal\" upon others and, if they do not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span>, to drive them out of the meeting? Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> knew that one particular party did not accept as the final goal partial Swarajya and slow reform. Still, in the draft he had prepared of the constitution, he tried to thrust the final goal of one particular party upon another and to drive out the latter from the Congress. The meaning of the new rule made by Mr. Gokhale was \"Accept a certain final goal, otherwise you have no place in the Congress and out you go.\" I ask those who say that our intention was to wreck the Congress, Is it not necessary to include people of different views in the National Congress? Was it not the intention of the other party to drive out of the Congress those whose final goal is different from that of Mr. Gokhale, but who still belong to that party which has national well-being at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>? Only those resolutions that are universally acceptable or acceptable to many will be passed. But none should attempt to forcibly eject another because his views do not tally with his own. Did the Nationalist party make any such attempt? Who were intolerant towards those who held views different from their own? To whom did the<span class='page-number' id='s-849' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.849]</span> presence of another party become unbearable in the Congress, the Moderates or the Extremists? This trick of driving out the opposite party was played by the Moderates and not by the Extremists. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> so, did the Nationalist party break up the National Congress?\n\nThe third important question is with regard to the retrogression of the Congress. We, the Nationalists, went to Surat to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the Congress progress by means of spiritedness, steadiness, and self-reliance. Our desire was, and is, that the fixed determinationâ€”the austere vowâ€”which the Bengali nation has resolved upon in its helplessness might spread to other provinces as well, and the people of those provinces might help us in our contest. Our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span> was to get tangible help from other provinces in our peaceful but determined contest. But we found all but one of the subjects omitted from this year's resolutions published in the name of the Reception Committee. These were subjects for which we fought zealously in the Calcutta Congress. What then of pushing the Congress forward? We became anxious to see whether it would remain where it was. Subjects were entirely omitted, and we cannot say whether they were introduced subsequently after making sweeping changes in them and rendering them vague whenever an objection from the Nationalists was anticipated, or whether the subjects which were thus mutilated and with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> suppressed were put in from the beginning. But on the list which was sent to Bombay on the 25th December 1907, but which was given to us on the 26th, that is, after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opening</span> of the Congress, we found the subjects greatly mutilated.\n\nMr. Gokhale states that the changes they introduced in the resolutions of last year were merely trivial and verbal and were made to make the meaning clear and to put them in better language. It is surprising to find that a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> like Mr. Gokhale says so! The resolution of Swarajya was passed last year at Calcutta. I have already told you how the final goal, which was clearly laid down in that resolution, has been rendered doubtful and insignificant by the introduction of the Creed resolution by Mr. Gokhale. The resolution about Swadeshi was also found<span class='page-number' id='s-850' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.850]</span> greatly pruned down. What great efforts the Nationalists had to make last year simply to introduce the words \"even at some sacrifice\"! By the introduction of these words the compromise was effected last year. These words were acceptable to both parties. Mr. Gokhale says they were inadvertently omitted. We could not reconcile with the past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of these words the fact of their omission by mistake or forgetfulness by Mr. Gokhale. Last year, when the people of both parties had assembled to settle their differences of opinion, I also had the opportunity to be present. Mr. Tilak, Aswini Babu and myself were the three representatives for our side. The opposite side was represented by Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Madan Mohan Malaviya. After a discussion among us five it was settled to add the words \"even at some sacrifice\". We could never believe that these words, which had been purposely put in, were omitted inadvertently. It cannot be said that we are doing an injustice to Mr. Gokhale if we infer, by looking at the radical changes made to the second resolution, that the words had been purposely omitted. How do we know that Mr. Gokhale, one of the General Secretaries, could not find out from the files of any newspaper the correct resolution? It is true that we did not think that Mr. Gokhale might forget the words even though they were introduced in the committee of the above-mentioned five persons.\n\nMr. Gokhale made such sweeping changes as would destroy the meaning of the boycott resolution and make the weapon of boycott adopted by the Bengalis appear to apply only to English-made goods. The boycott <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> inaugurated in Bengal has a wider significance than the boycott of British goods resorted to in Bengal. Taking the word \"movement\" to mean <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, Babu Bipin Chandra Pal expressed the hope before last year's Congress that the boycott movement would travel from one point to another, from one village to another, and from one province to another. Was it not the intention of Mr. Gokhale to cripple this resolution by altering its meaning? Even a superficial observer can see that the agitation in Bengal was not confined to British goods. When Government proclaimed the Partition, we distinctly informed Government that this Partition was not<span class='page-number' id='s-851' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.851]</span> acceptable to us. We adopted a universal boycott, which showed our disapproval of the Partition. It is known throughout <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> that our boycott means passive resistance. If the boycott was with regard to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> goods only, then why have honourable and spirited Bengali gentlemen resigned their seats in the Councils? Were the boycott in Bengal confined to goods only, were it merely a commercial boycott, where was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of boycotting Government schools? It is true that Bengal has boycotted English goods. But that was merely a subsidiary part of the all-pervading boycott. One thing must be borne in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> here, that the boycott of foreign goods is merely a commercial one, while that which is applied to English goods is of a political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span>. There is no necessity of applying these political weapons to any other country besides Britain. Why should we take revenge upon <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span> or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> for the oppression caused to us by the people of Britain? The reason we do not buy or will not in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> buy German or American goods is in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to increase Indian trades and industries. But there is a political reason besides this for the boycott of British goods; it is to make the brethren of our oppressors feel the pinch.\n\nThe boycott adopted by Bengal is of a different type, its scope and its extent are far-reaching. The meaning of our boycott is that we should not be of any help to Government in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> carried on by unjust and uncontrolled authority. This is so plain that it could be seen by anyone possessing eyes. Mr. Gokhale knew that we had started such a boycott. He purposely tried to create the impression that the Bengal boycott was directed against English goods only. Or his intention might have been to show that the Surat Congress at least accepted Bengal's boycott to that extent. The changes that were made in last year's resolution were very important and of a retrograde nature, from the standpoint of the Bengal Nationalists at least. And yet Mr. Gokhale says that the changes introduced were merely trivial and verbal. To him the changes may be very trivial, but it is impossible for the Bengal Nationalists to regard them as such. We did not at all like the flimsy picture drawn by Mr. Gokhale of the all-pervading boycott for the spread of which<span class='page-number' id='s-852' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.852]</span> weâ€”particularly the people of Eastern Bengalâ€”had to suffer so much. Boys received stripes, many of them suffered physical pangs in jail, and several others gave up everything. We did not like Mr. Gokhale's intention of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> a commercial appearance to our boycott. We fought zealously in order to secure sincere sympathy and suffered prosecutions, and this mode of passive resistance received support from the National Congress last year. By taking away that support, Mr. Gokhale rendered the resolution ineffectual; yet in the face of this open attempt, he says that the changes made were merely verbal.\n\nHe substituted the words \"independent system\" for the more important words \"on national lines and under national control\" in the resolution on national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>. Mr. Gokhale says that the word \"national\" occurred thrice in the resolution and this did not sound well, so the changes in the wording were made. Mr. Gokhale is a scholar of English, but we see a particular motive in repeating the word \"national\" thrice. An independent system of education may include education imparted by semi-government schools or colleges which receive government aid. But the words \"on national lines\" and \"under national control\" appeared to Mr. Gokhale as meaningless and superfluous, so he corrected the bad English sentence by putting it in good English in order to obtain some elegance of expression. There would have been no harm done, except slightly lowering Mr. Gokhale's reputation for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of English, if he had allowed the bad English to stand, as he knew that the Nationalist party would be displeased, and actually was displeased, at the change of languageâ€”this trivial verbal change made solely with a view to improving the elegance of style. The object of the Congress is not to enable men to write English correctly and elegantly. If slightly bad language would satisfy all, what harm would there be in allowing it to stand? It would be regarding the Nationalist party as ignorant and dull-headed to say that such a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> change in the resolution would be accepted by it as merely verbal.\n\nThese three questions are before those who say that our intention was to wreck the Congress. Who tried to destroy unconstitutionally the rights of members to speak? The Nationalist<span class='page-number' id='s-853' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.853]</span> party? Who made the ignoble attempt to drop out or drive out people of a particular opinion from the Congress by making rules partial to the constitutional party? The Nationalist party? Whose desire was it to put back the Congress by making changes in the resolutions passed universally on the strength of a local majority? The Nationalist party? These are important points. This year's fight in the Congress was between the ordinary people and unrestricted authority. It was a fight for principle in one way. How is it possible to put up with the arbitrariness of some people in a Congress which itself passes resolutions against the oppression of Government? The confusion that took place in the Congress was due to the peculiar circumstances of this year. It is not the fault of Mr. Tilak or of the Nationalist party. Whether there will be compromise or not, whether it will be possible to have any, will be decided by time alone. Our Nationalist party has to perform a very great task in the future. There are mountains of obstacles and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> in the way. Immense troubles will have to be suffered, hard work will have to be done and everything will have to be sacrificed; a great many will have to sacrifice their lives, then only will we be able to obtain that which is our final and exalted goal, the realisation of all happiness, the final achievement of all that is to be achieved and the desired object of allâ€”Swarajya.\n\nI shall speak tomorrow on what is to be done in the future.<span class='page-number' id='s-854' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.854]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-aims-of-the-nationalist-party","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Speeches"}],"nxtt":"Our Work in the Future","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/our-work-in-the-future","prvt":"Bande Mataram","prvu":"/cwsa/07/bande-mataram","dt":"1908-01-30","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["our-work-in-the-future"],"t":"Our Work in the Future","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Delivered in Nagpur on 31 January 1908.*","yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"My countrymen, those who have minutely observed with open eyes the agitation started two years ago, must have been convinced that the wonderful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of this agitation, this revolution in ideas, and these extreme changes in behaviour must have the support of some unseen wonderful supernatural and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> force.

In short, the full vigour of this movement cannot be comprehended by us poor human creatures. Some ordinary people, by getting up on this wave of awakening, have attained an exalted position and become <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> of the entire nation by means of their earnestness, burning patriotism, unparalleled self-sacrifice and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>.\n\nThe force of this movement was not diminished by the inflamed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span> of the other party, by dissensions among ourselves,<span class='page-number' id='s-855' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.855]</span> by the slanderings of back-biters, by the treachery of those who reveal the secrets of the house and who are guilty of incest with their Mother. This awakening is shoving away everything that comes in its way like the current of a river that sweeps away everything. Many wonderful religious revolutions have taken place in the different nations of this earth. This is also one of that sort. This revolution is taking place in the political atmosphere. This is the beginning of the political enhancement of a nation. The Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, by taking its seat on this current, is proving itself an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for the carrying out of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s wishes and is fulfilling His command naturally. There is no doubt that this commotion in the interior of the community will surely bring about some divine work. This agitation is certainly not propelled by human will. We went to Surat with a particular motive. We went to the Congress in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to propagate our views and doctrines. But there something different happened. The other party assembled there with the same purpose, but they were also disappointed! How can we say that this sudden split has not been brought about by God's design for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of the nation? Impossible to fathom are the motives of God and inscrutable is His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lila</span>. Unity is wanted, unity is essential. Is it God's intention to regenerate the nation by means of this split? Perhaps so, who can say? That a compromise should be effected between the two parties is the desire of all. Who can say what is going to happen in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>?\n\nThe work which has to be performed by the Nationalist party hereafter is very formidable. The strength and vitality of our party will be tested today. The strength of our party will be tried now. We ought to ascertain today exactly the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the work we have undertaken, our destination, the obstacles and pitfalls in the way, the weaknesses we possess, and the course we should adopt. Our dissensions were merely intellectual discussions till now. We required them to infuse <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of the nation,â€”our strength was limited, and we expended it in our debates. Nobody estimated correctly what strength we, our nation, possessed. None attempted to concentrate this power. Many do not yet believe in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of this power<span class='page-number' id='s-856' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.856]</span>and are not convinced; many people are whisked about; for this reason the two factions have cropped up. May it not be God's intention to get the work done through our party and through it alone? May it not be God's desire to find out the extent of our powers? The present time is not for slow progress. It is one of great quickness, extreme briskness and progress. Everyone should rush forward at this moment. Courage is wanted. Daring is required. Boldness is necessary. A writer at the time of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French Revolution</span> said, \"There is nothing to be dreaded. Run forward with firm devotion, go on, rush on, push on!\" In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> there was such a rapid progress. Perhaps our attempts to bring about compromise may prove fruitless. We ought, therefore, to settle on what we have to gain or obtain.\n\nThe way of the Moderates, the former devotees of the Congress, was different. They did not intend to change entirely the present arrangement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>. They did not want to progress. They wanted to make changes in the existing system of government. They did not require courage. But by their method the accomplishment of the object did not take place. It is impossible to obtain your rights. Simple good government cannot allay the thirst for Swarajya. If we were to throw our political responsibility, our political duty upon others, it would be nothing but political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> to us. That would be the greatest calamity. Those who care for their safety and comfort ought not to place their feet on our path. We do not want those who spare themselves. How can you procure a kingdom in the possession of foreigners through their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>kindness</span>? Your interests and theirs are entirely different. Why should those who have give by bits? Government will not give us the true rights of Swarajya even by degrees. It is afraid that if some rights are given, more will be demanded. To say that we shall compel Government to give us our rights is as dangerous as to cherish an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span> for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> Swarajya. We must adopt whatever remedies other nations of the world adopted to attain Swarajya, having regard to the present conditions. A final <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span> such as the colonial form of Swarajya is both inconvenient and vague. The effect of the agitation is also partial and indistinct. If the final goal is very high, exalted and<span class='page-number' id='s-857' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.857]</span> inspiring, then only will the workers be filled with enthusiasm and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. Hence we ought to have a high ideal before us. We have to travel towards this ideal of absolute Swarajya. We are often ridiculed that a desire for Swarajya is nothing but a dream, a castle in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span>, because our community has become weak, sapless, deranged and rickety. Where in our community is that courage which is required for the performance of such a great work, that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, that self-sacrifice and those <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> or spiritual remedies? Some people advise that because the achievement of Swarajya is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> human strength, we must wait for some centuries and work before we are able to speak of Swarajya; but no nation ever came into prominence by helping a foreign government. Lessons of independence must be learnt only in the school of liberty. If we wait for centuries the weakness of our nation will increase. We cannot afford to wait. If you want to acquire Swarajya, try for it now; otherwise give up the name Swarajya once for all.\n\nThe present agitation in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> sprang up suddenly in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. It has entirely changed the whole face of Bengal. There is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> created in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of everyone by divine prompting. It must be a divine arrangement; otherwise how could such a superhuman work be achieved within two years by the agitation carried on by a few obscure men? Perhaps you may not have examined carefully the agitation in Bengal. It was started by a few people first. People used to regard these originators as madmen. But these very madmen spread Swadeshism, preached boycott and established gymnasiums. This spread the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conflagration</span> of the agitation everywhere. The young generation assisted the movement; the whole of Bengal became alive and pricked up its ears. The leaders had no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in boycott, yet they could not hold their own against the current of public opinion. They joined the boycott movement. Government officers were terrified. They began their repressive policy in order to break the bones of agitation.\n\nStudents were the first to bear the brunt of the oppression and it was they who strenuously pushed on the sale of Swadeshi goods. Fines were imposed upon them for this. They were<span class='page-number' id='s-858' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.858]</span> punished and even were rusticated; but since they did not want to give up their Swadeshi vows, they left the schools. National schools had to be started. They were opened at Rangpur, Dacca and other places. The National Council of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span> of Bengal was established. As soon as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> was felt, the schools were started without much <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> or materials. Though there are no funds, no school buildings, no furniture, yet, through the help of the Bengali nation, all these institutions are in a flourishing condition.\n\nPeople are suffering immense troubles, undergoing imprisonments and whipping. Till now the people regarded the Bengali nation as impotent. The opinion of a certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> gentleman is that the Bengalis are well-versed in education and every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> among them is intellectual and dutiful, but from the political standpoint they are lifeless; they cannot do anything. But since the Swadeshi movement began this condition has changed. The difference between speaking and actually doing has disappeared. All the patriots are, as it were, one person and are moved by the same thoughts. Our younger generation seems to have lost regard for their lives. The example of Maulavi Liakat Hussain is not the only one. There are many such examples. Maulavi Liakat Hussain does not even know Bengali properly. But the endeavours and self-sacrifice made by this brave and noble-minded person are indescribable! There are three prosecutions pending against him at present. He not only accepted with a smile three years' imprisonment recently inflicted on him, but expressed his obligation to the Magistrate for having afforded him an opportunity to serve his country! He has gone to jail perhaps never to return again. The story of the *Yugantar* newspaper is very wonderful. No sooner was one editor sentenced to one year's imprisonment than another took his place. The moment the second <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> was prosecuted and sentenced, a third one came forward and willingly accepted the responsibility of editorship, in spite of the warning of the Magistrate! He was followed by a fourth person and thus the paper was continued. Whenever any editor was punished, his great concern was for the future issue of the paper; he did not think of his wife and children first. In<span class='page-number' id='s-859' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.859]</span> this way the *Yugantar* still continues. And so the Bengalis are sacrificing their self-interest and their all in accordance with the teachings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bhagavad <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gita</span></span>: \"Thy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> is with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> only, never with its fruits.\"\n\nThe Nationalist party in Bengal did not shrink at all. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> was merely a name before in the geography of the world. It became a mighty nation in the course of twenty years. The same thing is going on in Bengal. The divine splendour of Bengali youths is clearly shining forth. The divine element has manifested itself. As soon as Government removes one, one hundred others take his place. Every Bengali patriot feels inclined to sacrifice his own self for the good of thirty crores of people. This idea ought to spread throughout the country. The misery of the Indian nation must be looked upon as the misery of everyone, and the pleasure of the nation must be regarded by him as his own. One ought to feel pride in bearing pain and anguish. To suffer such pangs is to repay one's debt to the nation.\n\nNations do not prosper without self-sacrifice. None should turn back like a woman from repaying his debt to the nation. We do not want laziness, legerdemain or acting. Matured circumspection, limited and carefully adopted remedies will not do; one should rush forth. The self-respect of the nation is our religion, self-sacrifice is our only action or duty. We ought to give proper scope for the divine qualities in us to shine forth. Trifling <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span> ought to be given up. Do not be afraid even if you are required to die. Do not retreat; bear pain for the sake of the nation. God is your support. If you do this, the Indian nation will, in an instant, get back its former splendour and glory. It will take its place at the side of the independent nations of the world; it will educate other nations; it will shed the lustre of true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, and it will inculcate the principles of Vedanta. Our nation will come forward to benefit the human race and the whole world. Before it the whole world will tremble! But when? Only when we all are prepared to repay our debt to the nation.<span class='page-number' id='s-860' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.860]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/our-work-in-the-future","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Speeches"}],"nxtt":"Commercial and Educational Swarajya","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/commercial-and-educational-swarajya","prvt":"The Aims of the Nationalist Party","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-aims-of-the-nationalist-party","dt":"1908-01-31","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["commercial-and-educational-swarajya"],"t":"Commercial and Educational Swarajya","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Delivered in Nagpur on 1 February 1908.*","yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"My countrymen, I am greatly obliged to you for the reception you have given me. This is not respect paid to me, but to our motherland through me as medium. The people of whatever place I have been in have shown a wonderful enthusiasm, which clearly proves that national sentiments are enkindled in their bosoms. The thought of what we were two years ago, what things were liked by the people then, and what a change has taken place in the mental condition is very encouraging.\n\nFrom the time the Swadeshi <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was started by the Bengalis, we notice an exalted and self-sacrificing spirit in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the people. It is not that there was no Swadeshi movement before. Rich Bengalis had started Swadeshi companies before the said agitation; as soon as these companies came into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> the European companies began to cause loss to them by reducing their own rates, and in the end they began to request people to take their (<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span>) goods free. That earnestness for Swadeshi, that particular resolve to buy nothing but Swadeshi goods, however dear, did not exist then. For want of support of the national awakening, the Swadeshi trades did not thrive then. People have accepted Swadeshism in total disregard of the quality and price of the Swadeshi goods because of the awakening of the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> everywhere in the shape of the Swadeshi and boycott movements started on account of the Partition of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. Though the rates of the Swadeshi navigation companies were two or three times greater than those of the foreign companies, yet the former were patronised by the patriots. This is due to the development of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>.\n\nIt is well known to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> what efforts were made by the young men of Bengal. It is they who worked for the boycott. They<span class='page-number' id='s-861' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.861]</span> purchased Swadeshi cloth and sold it at cost price without taking any profit from the villagers in the mofussil. If at that time the Bombay merchants and mill-owners and the Marwaris of Calcutta had co-operated with us sincerely, the Swadeshi and boycott movements would have been in a different condition today. The mill-owners of Bombay took advantage of the Swadeshi movement and enhanced their rates, thus putting impediments in our way and compelling us to buy the same goods dearly. We had to work hard to command the market, because our Marwari brethren did not give up their profession as brokers and continued to sell English goods.\n\nIt is very necessary to boycott English goods. Did not the English boycott your goods? A hundred years ago, your trades and industries were in a flourishing condition and your goods, after satisfying the demands of the whole of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, used to be exported to other countries. But by making all sorts of crooked laws, they managed to shut out your goods from our markets and, on the contrary, afforded all sorts of facilities enabling the foreign merchants to flood the market with their own goods. Our Marwari brethren ought to have understood this. They purposely or through obstinacy born of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> caused a loss to the country, so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> has punished them for it. All-powerful God brought down calamity on them, considering that those who acted against the interests of His children will never come to their senses unless they are punished. The Marwaris are mostly Jains. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> has taken possession of Parswanath Hill, and on the spot where people used to flock for worship, there will be bungalows erected in which there will be dancing and *tamashas*, and the eating and drinking of prohibited foods and drinks. What does Government care for the entreaties, petitions and deputations of the Jains? God must have designed this to serve as an eye-opener to these Marwaris and to show them how much regard those English have for their welfareâ€”the English for whose benefit the Marwaris acted treacherously towards their own people. The Marwaris ought to take a lesson from the calamity and be prepared to act in accordance with God's design.<span class='page-number' id='s-862' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.862]</span>\n\nSee what the foreigners are doing. See what troubles thousands of your brethren who have gone to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Africa</span> to attain a commercial balance by making up the commercial loss sustained in India are suffering. Very oppressive and inhuman laws are inflicted upon them, they are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> treated like beasts, and devilish attempts are in progress to destroy their commercial superiority here. It is therefore necessary to take in our hands all the trades and industries, and our rich people should gird up their loins for the same purpose. We ought to change the ways or methods of expenditure. These attempts to secure commercial Swarajya must be vigorously carried out. There will be <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> and losses in attaining this, but it cannot be helped. Such troubles must be suffered until the demerits of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> are exhausted.\n\nThere ought to be institutions started in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to impress these ideas on the minds of the young. It is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> sign that attempts are being made to start schools for national training in our Bengal and in your town. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> such institutions are coming into existence at several places in Bengal. We do not want the unnecessary parrot-like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> which wastes away the strength and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> of our young men. It is much better to have a harmonious combination of self-protection and patriotism, but we do not want even for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> moment that poisonous education imparted to our children which has a blighting effect on the ideas of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>morality</span> and national greatness by creating a hankering in them for the subordinate posts under Government in order to earn their livelihood. Education should be imparted on national lines and under national control. True <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span> consists in awakening in one's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> the highest ideas of national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, which make one forget oneself and feel that he does not exist separately from his country. The expressions \"national lines\" and \"national control\" are very important, and therefore we insisted on having them in the resolution of the National Congress. It is not possible to have national education without the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of the rich and the learned men.

To take the position that because he has led in the past therefore his word must be law so long as he lives, is to ignore the root principles of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>.

Long habit and apprehension were the only obstacles in their way which prevented them from throwing themselves into the current.

We hold no brief for anyone, but we believe that Srijut Manoranjan Guha was an inspired speaker when he told the Conference never to lose sight of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>.

Let us work practically at the smallest details, but let us never forget that the work is not for its own sake but for the sake of Swaraj. We shall be false to our inspiration if we forget the goal in the details; we shall condemn ourselves to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> who in the eagerness of picking up pebbles on the seashore threw away the alchemic stone which God had for a moment given into his hands. Swaraj is the alchemic stone, the *parash-pathar*, and we have it in our hands. It will turn to gold everything we touch. Village samitis are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, not for the sake of village samitis but for the sake of Swaraj. Boycott is good, not for the sake of Boycott but for the sake of Swaraj. Swadeshi is good, not for the sake of Swadeshi but for the sake of Swaraj. Arbitration is good, not for the sake of arbitration but for the sake of Swaraj. If we forget Swaraj and win anything else we shall be like the seeker whose belt was turned indeed to gold but the stone of alchemy was lost to him for ever.\n\nNever should we forget that but for the hope of Swaraj we should never have done what we have done during the last three years. No lesser hope, no ideal of inferior grandeur could have nerved us to the tremendous efforts, the great sacrifices, the indomitable persistence in the face of persecution which has made these three years ever memorable as the birth-time of a nation. Who could have borne what we have borne for the sake of some petty object? No good can result from denying what God has revealed to us. When Peter denied his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>, half of his virtue went out of him. Let not our people have to repent as Peter had to repent, and shed tears of bitter sorrow because the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> has been expelled by their own folly from their bosom.

Spiritual freedom the ancient Rishis had already declared to us; social freedom was part of the message of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaitanya</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nanak</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kabir</span> and the saints of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span>; political freedom is the last word of the triune gospel. Without political freedom the soul of man is crippled. Only a few mighty spirits can rise above their surroundings, but the ordinary man is a slave of his surroundings and if those be mean, servile and degraded, he himself will be mean, servile and degraded. Social freedom can only be born where the soul of man is large, free and generous, not enslaved to petty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> and thoughts. Social freedom is not a result of social <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> but of the freedom of the human intellect and the nobility of the human soul. A man who follows petty ends cannot feel his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span> with his fellows, for he is always striving to raise himself above them and assert petty superiorities. If <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> makes him superior or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> makes him superior, he will hug to his bosom the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> of caste or the distinctions of wealth. If political freedom is absent, the community has no great ends to follow and the individual is confined within a narrow circuit in which the superiority of caste, wealth or class is the only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span> which he can cherish. If political freedom opens to him a wider horizon, he forgets the lesser ambitions. Moreover a slave can never be noble and broad-minded. He cannot forget himself in the service of his fellows for he is already a slave and service is the badge of his degradation, not a willing self-devotion. When man is thus degraded, it is idle to think that society can be free.\n\nSo too spiritual freedom can never be the lot of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> in a land of slaves. A few may follow the path of the Yogin and rise above their surroundings, but the mass of men cannot ever take the first step towards spiritual salvation. We do not believe that the path of salvation lies in selfishness. If the mass of men around us is miserable, fallen, degraded, how can the seeker after God be indifferent to the condition of his brothers? <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Compassion</span> to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> creatures is the condition of sainthood, and the perfect Yogin<span class='page-number' id='s-875' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.875]</span> is he who is *sarvabhutahite ratah*, whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> is full of the will to do good to all creatures. When a man shuts his heart to the cries of sufferings around him, when he is content that his fellow-men should be sorrowful, oppressed, sacrificed to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>greed</span> of others, he is making his own way to salvation full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> and stumbling-blocks. He is forgetting that God is not only in himself but in all these millions. And for those who have not the strength, spiritual freedom in political servitude is a sheer impossibility. When <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> was free, thousands of men set their feet in the stairs of heaven, but as the night deepened and the sun of liberty withdrew its rays, the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> inborn in every Indian heart became weaker and weaker until now it <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>burns</span> so faintly that aliens have taken upon themselves the role of spiritual teachers, and the people chosen by God have to sit at the feet of the men from whose ancestry the light was hidden. God has set apart India as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> fountain-head of holy spirituality, and He will never suffer that fountain to run dry. Therefore Swaraj has been revealed to us. By our political freedom we shall once more recover our spiritual freedom. Once more in the land of the saints and sages will burn up the fire of the ancient Yoga and the hearts of her people will be lifted up into the neighbourhood of the Eternal.<span class='page-number' id='s-876' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.876]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/swaraj","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Future of the Movement","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-future-of-the-movement","prvt":"Speeches at Pabna - II","prvu":"/cwsa/07/speeches-at-pabna-ii","dt":"1908-02-18","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-future-of-the-movement"],"t":"The Future of the Movement","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When a great people rises from the dust, what *mantra* is the *sanjivani mantra* or what power is the resurrecting <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of its resurgence?

The *mantra* of \"Bande Mataram\" is a *mantra* once before given to the world by the Sannyasins of the Vindhya hills. It was lost by the treachery of our own countrymen because the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> was not then ripe for resurgence and a premature awakening would have brought about a speedy downfall. But when in the great earthquake of 1897 there was a voice heard by the Sannyasins, and they were conscious of the decree of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> that India should rise again, the *mantra* was again revealed to the world. It was echoed in the hearts of the people, and when the cry had ripened in silence in a few great hearts, the whole nation became conscious of the revelation. Who imagined when the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> rose in 1905 against the Partition that that was the beginning of a great upheaval? It is a passing tempest, said the wise men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>, let it go over our heads and we will wait. But the tempest did not pass, nor the thunders cease. So there was a reconsideration of policy and the wise men said,â€”The people of Bengal are easily cowed down, and we will try whether force cannot do what patience has failed to do. When Sir Bampfylde Fuller met <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> at Agra, this was the policy agreed on between themâ€”to hammer the Bengalis into quietude. But Sir Bampfylde Fuller has gone and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> remains. Hare too will go, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> will go, but the movement will remain. The regulation<span class='page-number' id='s-877' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.877]</span> *lathi*, the Police truncheon, the threat of the Gurkha rifle are as straws in the wind before the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> breath of God. Human power is mere weakness when measured with the will of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>. So the movement will continue. It is now time to look deeper into it and know its fountain sources. So long we were content with the superficial aspects, but the time has come for God to reveal Himself, and the powers of the world to look on in amazement at His wonderful workings. When we left Pabna we knew that He was at work to unite the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengali race</span>. We hope yet to see that He is at work to unite the Indian people. When the Convention Committee meets at Allahabad, it will be seen whether it is His will to unite the parties into a single whole or to separate them from each other, so that the work of salvation may be hastened by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of the Nationalist party <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> separated from the steadiness of the Moderates. Whatever may happen, it is His will. We look forward to the Easter meeting for light on what He intends. If the Moderate leaders of Bengal are wise, they will realise that Bengal at least is destined to become predominatingly Nationalist, that it is her mission to lead and force the rest of India to follow. Whoever tries to prevent her from fulfilling that mission, is setting himself against the decrees of God and will be blown away like stubble before the tempest.<span class='page-number' id='s-878' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.878]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-future-of-the-movement","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Work and Ideal","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/work-and-ideal","prvt":"Swaraj","prvu":"/cwsa/07/swaraj","dt":"1908-02-19","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["work-and-ideal"],"t":"Work and Ideal","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> advised by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> nowadays not to quarrel over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> but to attend to the work lying nearest to our hands.

A benevolent Minto, a Radical Morley are not the men to stand in the way of such admirable aspirations. The present share of the people in the government of their own country is nothing; they want more of it: very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, we will give them a larger share of nothing. The Legislative Council is a nothing; go to, we will enlarge that nothing; we will add fresh nothings in the shape of an Advisory Council of notables to assist the educated class in doing nothing and lest the burden of such an arduous task should be too heavy for their educated shoulders we will give them upon the Councils plenty of capable helpers some of whom have been doing nothing all their lives and ought by now to be experts. If after that the educated class does not feel satisfied in its aspirations, if it does not feel as full-fed and happy as Sir Harvey after his haggis, well, they are ungrateful brutes and there is an end of it.\n\n---\n\nUnkind people have said that the intention of the Government was not to satisfy the aspirations of the educated class but to exclude them from the Councils under the cover of a misnamed \"reforms\". Sir Harvey is naturally shocked at so gross an imputation against his benevolent Government. All that the Government <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> is to make the representation of the lawyers and educated men a \"fair\" representation. It does not want to exclude educated men, but only to swamp them with zamindars, Mahomedans and Europeans; and it does not want to \"suppress the middle class\" but only to reduce them to a nullity. And this because they will not have \"what is scornfully known in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> as a vakil-ridden country\". It was evidently the generosity of the<span class='page-number' id='s-772' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.772]</span> champagne that made Sir Harvey expand all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> into the East. We are not aware that the vakil class as it exists in India is to be found anywhere except in India. It is the happy result of British rule in this favoured land that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> now consists of a huge mass of starving peasants, a small <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of dumb Government servants, and sweated office clerks, a landed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span> habitually overawed, fleeced and for the most part well advanced on the road to ruin, a sprinkling of prosperous middlemen and as the only independent class a handful of lawyers, journalists and schoolmasters. That is what Sir Harvey calls a vakil-ridden country. We have heard the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> Vakil-Raj, but we have not heard it used \"scornfully\" except by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Indians</span>. But no doubt when he talks of the East, Sir Harvey means himself and his brother Scots out to make <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> in the East, just as by Indian trade is always meant Anglo-Indian trade and by Indian prosperity the prosperity of Anglo-India. This is a sort of official slang which has become a recognised idiom of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> language. Anglo-India is equal to India, India is equal to the East, therefore Anglo-India is the East. The Anglo-Indian has mastered the practice of the Vedanta, for he sees himself as the whole world, and the whole world in himself; why should he then make any bones about attributing his own sentiments to a whole continent?\n\n---\n\nThe Government, we are gratified to learn, has no intention of stemming the flowing tide. It wants instead to cut a new channel for the tide and divert it into a lake of notables where it will cease from its flowing and be at rest. As for the old channel of Swadeshi and Swaraj, it will be carefully stopped up with a strong composite of sedition laws, Gurkhas and regulation lathis. But meanwhile what does the tide itself think about this neat little plan? Well, says Sir Harvey, Moderate politicians are delighted, but the native press dissatisfied. We had to look twice at this remarkable assertion to make sure that the champagne (or was it good old Scotch) which Sir Harvey had drunk to the health of the unrest, had not missed its way and wandered<span class='page-number' id='s-773' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.773]</span> into our eyes instead of Sir Harvey's legislative cranium. All the native papers then are Extremist <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>! What all, Sir Harvey? The *Bengalee* no less than the *Bande Mataram*, the *Indu Prakash* in the same boat with the *Kesari*? All Extremists, for have not all expressed dissatisfaction with reforms which would have been received two years ago with an unanimous shriek of infantine <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>delight</span>? Who then can be Moderates? Sir Harvey was right after all. It is the virus of Extremism which has entered secretly into the unsophisticated Congress <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and taught it to ask for something more than its long-cherished baubles. But in that case who are the Moderate politicians who are satisfied with the new playthings? Why, of course, Mr. Malabari and the Maharaja of Burdwan and Nawab of Dacca. For at this rate even Sir Pherozshah is suspected of Extremism.\n\n---\n\nSir Harvey has much to say about sedition and what he says is very interesting. He explains what sedition is and the explanation is of course authoritative, since it comes from the Law Member. First, the preaching of active rebellion against the British Government. To that of course there can be no objection. Whoever preaches an armed rebellion, does it with the gaol and gallows before his eyes, and is not likely to complain if he is punished. Secondly, efforts to reduce the native army from its allegiance, and then we get a remarkable sentence. \"The Government has been publicly charged with instigation of dacoity and sacrilege\" etc. As we all know a charge was made by the whole press, Moderate, Extremist and Loyalist, against local officials, of having given a free hand to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> hooliganism, and the charge was never refuted and now Sir Harvey identifies the Government with these officials and lays down the law that whoever brings a charge against any official is guilty of sedition! \"I and my Father in Simla are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span>,\" the local official may now say, \"and he who blasphemeth against me blasphemeth against him.\" Secondly the Government has been charged with \"propagating famine and plague\". We note therefore that it is sedition to say that the economic conditions created and perpetuated by<span class='page-number' id='s-774' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.774]</span> the present system of government are responsible for famine and poverty and the diseases which thrive on poverty! Thirdly, the Government is seditiously charged with draining the resources of India for the benefit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>. So it is sedition too to talk of the drain or refer to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> and his luminous remarks about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> and exploitation! These are, it seems, \"turgid accusations which are made to sell and do not influence sober-minded men\". So Mr. R. C. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dutt</span> is not a sober-minded man, nor Mr. Dadabhai <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Naoroji</span>, nor Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span>, nor even the knighted Bombay Lion. They are all turgid seditionists whose utterances are \"made to sell\". One wonders who and where the devil are these sober-minded men of Sir Harvey's whom he warrants immune from turgidity, and again one has to fall back on Mr. B. M. Malabari, the Maharaja of Burdwan and the Nawab of Dacca. O blest and sainted trio.\n\n---\n\nOf course Sir Harvey is strong on the seditious press, in other words, the organs of anti-bureaucratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>. Our newspapers are \"of a low class\", their editors have \"discovered that sedition is a commercial success\" and so write, it is suggested, what they do not believe because it sells. Fudge, Sir Harvey! If you could be transformed from a perorating official Scot into the manager of a Nationalist newspaper for the first year or two of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, you would \"discover\" at what tremendous pecuniary and personal sacrifice these papers have been established and maintained. If Sir Harvey knew anything about the conditions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> in the land he is helping to misgovern, he would know that an Indian newspaper, unless it is long established, and sometimes even then, can command immense influence and yet be commercially no more than able to pay its way, especially when on principle it debars itself from taking all but Swadeshi advertisements. Fudge, Sir Harvey! The Nationalists are not shopkeepers trading in the misery of the millions; they are men like Upadhyay and Bipin Pal and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> more who have put from them all the ordinary chances of life to devote themselves to a cause, and in the few instances in which a Nationalist journal<span class='page-number' id='s-775' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.775]</span> has been run at a profit, the income has gone to Swadeshi work and the maintenance of workers and not into the pockets of the proprietors, while in almost every case men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and ability have foregone their salary or half starved on a pittance in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to relieve the burden of the struggling journal. These are your editors of low newspapers, traders in sedition, \"interested agitators\", men without sense of responsibility or \"matured understanding\". You say the thing which is not, and know it, a licensed slanderer of men a corner of whose brains has a richer content than your whole Scotch skull and whose shoes you are unworthy to touch.\n\n---\n\nIt is refreshing to learn that Sir Harvey thinks he has got under one chief means of sedition, the platform, by his gagging ordinance turned into law. He has stiffened it, he says, into a tap which can be turned on wherever his vigilant eye sees a travelling spark of sedition, so on that side the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span> and the profits of the clans are safe. But against the press he has not been able to find an equally effective extinguisher. The Government were apparently equal to the manufacture, but they want to try those tools they have before forging others that we know not of. The British public also might turn nasty if there were too rapid a succession of such stiffenings and Morley might find the fur coat an insufficient protection against the cold biting blasts of his friends' ingratitude. So Sir Harvey means to try a few more prosecutions first. But if Kingsford's pills prove ineffective, well, then Sir Harvey, in spite of the British public and Mr. Morley's sufferings, will be the first to recommend the smothering of the patient who refuses to be cured. After that the orator passed off into complaints about his bearer and praises of whiskey and soda and other subjects too sacred to touch. And so on the note of \"whiskey in moderation\" Sir Harvey closed his historic speech. And the British Empire knew itself safe.<span class='page-number' id='s-776' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.776]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-1","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo"}],"nxtt":"Caste and Representation","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/caste-and-representation","prvt":"More about Unity","prvu":"/cwsa/07/more-about-unity","dt":"1907-12-05","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-latest-sedition-trial"],"t":"The Latest Sedition Trial","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We do not generally concern ourselves with the results of trials in bureaucratic law-courts.

The Magistrate was confronted with the difficulty that neither common sense nor jurisprudence can penalise the preaching of a political truth. The strange syllogism with which he has sought to bring the preaching of an ideal within the purview of the bureaucratic law is ridiculous to the extreme. The Magistrate in his judgment does not seem even to know his own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>. In the earlier part of his judgment he talks as if the preaching of independence as an ideal were in itself sedition. \"To my mind,\" he says in powerful magisterial fashion, \"the meaning and intention of this article admit of no doubt whatever. The writer is advocating independence and the article is seditious.\" Later on he has misgivings. Glimpses of a common sense buried deep away under long <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of reading political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> into judicial interpretation seem to visit the official mind:\n\n\"The ideal of national independence is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> which appeals to Englishmen with very strong force, and it is one which when<span class='page-number' id='s-883' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.883]</span> reasonably and temperately expressed will always meet with a great deal of sympathy. There is undoubtedly at the present day, a growing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> amongst men of liberal and statesmanlike views that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> will at a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> date attain this national independence. Moreover it is an object with which the use of force need not be associated at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> for it is an object attainable by constitutional means. I believe therefore that no Liberal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> would ever take serious exception to the temperate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the ideal.\"\n\nThe only fault to be found with this expression of a commonsense view of things is that the Magistrate seems to lay down the proposition that it depends on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> and views of Englishmen whether the preaching of independence is seditious or not. That is so in practice, no doubt, but judicially it is a strange principle of interpretation. On this ground, clearly stated by the Magistrate, that the preaching of national independence is not in itself seditious and does not become seditious unless coupled with excitations to revolt or violence or with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> tending to bring the Government into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span> or contempt,â€”the Printer of the *Nabasakti* was entitled to an acquittal. But the Magistrate immediately afterwards falls back from light into a thick fog in which he flounders helplessly for some way of unsaying what he has said.\n\n\"An Indian writer, however, who holds up national independence as an immediate panacea for the wrongs of his countrymen, is a mere visionary, and it is most unfortunate that so much of the political writing in Bengali newspapers should be the crude product of ignorant and ill-trained minds.\" And he goes on to say that the accused had published articles of this description and coupled them with others inciting to violence. Therefore he is convicted of sedition. Are we then to understand that the Printer is found guilty of sedition not because he advocated independence but because he advocated independence in an ignorant and ill-trained manner and his article was a crude product? If an article is to be declared seditious merely because it does not please the literary taste of a Police Court Magistrate, a new terror will be added to the law of sedition. Or are we to understand<span class='page-number' id='s-884' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.884]</span> that the article is not seditious, is quite innocent, since to preach independence is not seditious, but it is declared seditious because other articles in the paper which contain nothing about independence, are violent in tone? So far as we can see from the judgment of this learned Magistrate, the article in question is not seditious, though it may or may not be \"a crude product\"; the other articles are not seditious though they may come under some other section of the Penal Code than 124A, and in any case they are not the subject matter of the charge. But because one article preaches independence and another which has no connection with it is written in a violent tone, therefore the first non-seditious article is transmuted into sedition by some strange magisterial alchemy. We come out of the reading of this judgment with a bewildered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> and only one clearly grasped idea, viz., that whether what we write is seditious or not, depends not on the law, but on the state of \"public opinion\" in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> and Anglo-India, and on the intellectual vagaries of a Magistrate who cannot even misinterpret the law consistently. And after all that is \"all we know or need to know\" on the subject of the law of sedition.<span class='page-number' id='s-885' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.885]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-latest-sedition-trial","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Boycott and British Capital","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/boycott-and-british-capital","prvt":"By the Way","prvu":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-1","dt":"1908-02-21","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["boycott-and-british-capital"],"t":"Boycott and British Capital","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We published yesterday a communicated article on the economic danger of excepting from the Boycott British manufactures produced on Indian soil.

The danger of an invasion of our market by British capital on a gigantic scale, the transference of Manchester to the banks of the Hughly is not a danger of the immediate moment. But in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, if the pressure of a spreading Boycott and the growth of Indian industry on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> trade with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> becomes a strangling pressure, the first economic result would inevitably be the migration of English capital to this country to compete under more favourable circumstances.

There are, however, strong considerations on the other side. There is first the natural reluctance of capital to leave its own nest where it is safest unless it is sure of compensating gains. There is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> that a wholesale migration of a great manufacture to a distant country is conceivable in theory, but hardly practicable and certainly unprecedented.

The possibility that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>'s rule in India may some day cease either by invasion from outside, convulsion from within or a peaceful departure, must always be present to the eye of so timid an entity as capital, and so long as the present unrest and the exploitation of it by enterprising journalists continues, we need not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> wholesale industrial invasion; but the unrest is likely to last so long as the bureaucracy maintain their present uncompromising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> and Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> does not come by its own.

The Apara Vidya is the sum of science but there is a higher Vidya, a mightier <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>. When we are under the influence of the lower knowledge, we imagine that we are doing everything and try to reason out the situation we find ourselves in, as if our intellect were sovereign and omnipotent.<span class='page-number' id='s-891' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.891]</span> But this is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of delusion and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span>. Whoever has once felt the glory of God within him can never again believe that the intellect is supreme. There is a higher voice, there is a more unfailing oracle. It is in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> where God resides. He works through the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span>, but the brain is only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of His instruments. Whatever the brain may plan, the heart knows first and whoever can go <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the brain to the heart, will hear the voice of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Eternal</span>. This is what Srijut Aurobindo <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span> said in his Bombay speech. But our contemporary, the *Indian Patriot*, has lamented his downfall from the high pedestal of culture he once occupied. Our contemporary has forgotten the teachings of Vivekananda which were once so powerful in Madras. What does he think was the cause of the great awakening in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>?\n\nWhen <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> thought to rend Bengal asunder, he deprived her of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> her old pride and reliance upon her intellectual superiority. She had thought to set her wits against British power and believed that the intellect of her sons would be a match for the clumsy brains of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> statesmen. Lord Curzon showed her that Power is too direct and invincible to be outwitted. The brains of Bengal did their best to cope with him and they failed. No course remained to Bengal which her intellect could suggest. But when she was utterly reduced to despair, the time came for her own power to awake and set itself against that of the foreigner. She flung aside the devices of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and took on herself the majesty of Roman strength and valour. When she declared the Boycott, she did so without calculation, without reckoning chances, without planning how the Boycott could succeed. She simply declared it. Was the intellect at work when she declared it? Was it her leaders who planned it as a means of bringing the British to their knees?\n\nEverybody knows that it was not so. It was Kishoregunj, it was Magura, the obscure villages and towns of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal which first declared the Boycott. What brain planned it, what voice first uttered it, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> will never be able to discover. None planned it, but it was in the heart of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and God revealed it. If human brains had thought over the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span>, Boycott would never have been declared. Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal is the most<span class='page-number' id='s-892' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.892]</span> powerful brain at present at work in Bengal, but Srijut Bipin Chandra has himself often related that he was opposed to the Boycott in its inception, because his intellect refused to assent to the economic possibility of Boycott. So with all the men who were then the recognised brains and voices of Bengal. Only the nation had Boycott in their hearts and the heart of Bengal refused to be silenced by its brain. So Boycott was declared. Had the *Indian Patriot* been the mouthpiece of Bengal it would have asked for a plan of operations. But what plan of operations could have been given? So we see from this one great example what Srijut Aurobindo Ghose meant when he said that it was God's work and not man's. If the *Indian Patriot* can show us who planned the Boycott, or how it has been guided to success by human intellect, we will accept his view of things. Meanwhile, we shall take leave to approve of the view expressed by Srijut Aurobindo Ghose. God is behind this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and He does not need anyone to tell Him how to bring it to success. He will see to that Himself. Whatever plans we may make, we shall find quite useless when the time for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> comes. Revolutions are always full of surprises, and whoever thinks he can play chess with a revolution will soon find how terrible is the grasp of God and how insignificant the human reason before the whirlwind of His breath. That man only is likely to dominate the chances of a revolution, who makes no plans but preserves his heart pure for the will of God to declare itself. The great rule of life is to have no schemes but one unalterable purpose. If the will is fixed on the purpose it sets itself to accomplish, then circumstances will suggest the right course; but the schemer finds himself always tripped up by the unexpected.<span class='page-number' id='s-893' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.893]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-glory-of-god-in-man","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"A National University","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-national-university","prvt":"The Soul and India's Mission","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-soul-and-indias-mission","dt":"1908-02-22","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-national-university"],"t":"A National University","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The idea of a National University is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the ideas which have formulated themselves in the national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> and become part of the immediate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of a people.

The City College, the Ferguson College and others started with this aim but they are now monuments of a frustrated idea. In every case they have fallen to the state of ordinary institutions, replicas of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> model, without a separate mission or nobler reason for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>. And they have so fallen because their promoters could not understand or forgot that the first condition of success was independenceâ€”an independence jealously preserved and<span class='page-number' id='s-894' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.894]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span>. In other words there can be no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span> without national control.\n\nA certain measure of success has been secured by two institutions of a later <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span>, the Benares Hindu College and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Dayananda</span> Anglo-Vedic College. These are successful institutions, but isolated. They have not developed into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of a network of schools affiliated to them and forming one corporate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. They have not in themselves the makings of Universities. So far as they give religious teaching they are a wholesome departure from the barren official form of education, but that is only one part of education on national lines. National education cannot be defined briefly in one or two sentences, but we may describe it tentatively as the education which starting with the past and making full use of the present builds up a great nation. Whoever wishes to cut off the nation from its past, is no friend of our national growth. Whoever fails to take advantage of the present is losing us the battle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. We must therefore save for India <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> that she has stored up of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and noble thought in her immemorial past. We must acquire for her the best knowledge that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> can give her and assimilate it to her own peculiar type of national temperament. We must introduce the best methods of teaching <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> has developed, whether modern or ancient. And all these we must harmonise into a system which will be impregnated with the spirit of self-reliance so as to build up men and not machinesâ€”national men, able men, men fit to carve out a career for themselves by their own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> power and resource, fit to meet the shocks of life and breast the waves of adventure. So shall the Indian people cease to sleep and become once more a people of heroes, patriots, originators, so shall it become a nation and no longer a disorganised mass of men.\n\nNational education must therefore be on national lines and under national control. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> is the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of its being. No one who has not grasped it, can hope to build up a National University. Mrs. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Besant</span> has recently begun a campaign in favour of national education and in a recent speech has outlined her idea of a National University. We have every respect for<span class='page-number' id='s-895' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.895]</span> this great orator and organiser, but we are bound to point out that an university organised by Mrs. Besant will not be a National University. In the first place the future University must be one built up by the brain and organising power of India's own sons. It shall never be said that the first National University in India was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of a foreigner and that the children of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> were content to follow and imitate but could not lead and originate. Such a charge would be fatal to the very object of the University. Secondly, Mrs. Besant has forgotten that the basis of a National University has already been laid. The National Council of Education in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> has already commenced the great work on lines which have only to be filled in, and their work has received the blessing of God and increases. But Mrs. Besant has omitted to make any mention of their work and speaks as if she intended to have the Benares College as the basis of the National University. But the Benares College has shown itself unfit for so huge a task. It has been obliged to rely on foreign funds and to court Government patronage. Even the Dayananda Anglo-Vedic College is a more robust growth, for it has been built up by the munificent self-sacrifice of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Arya Samaj</span>. No institution which cannot rely on the people of India for its support and build itself up without official support or patronage, can be considered to have established its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of developing into a National University. Finally, Mrs. Besant shows by her scheme that she is not in possession of the true secret of the movement. She wants a Charter from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>. We are aware that she talks of organising the University with the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of Indian talent and keeping it as a preserve for Indian control, but when she asks for a Charter it is evident that she has not realised what national control implies. No Government will give a Charter which excludes them from all control. There may be no provision for control in the Charter itself, but the power that gives the Charter can at any moment insist on seeing that the University merits the Charter. Once this constructive possibility of control is allowed to overshadow the infant institution, goodbye to its utility, its greatness, its future. It will follow the way of other schools and colleges and become a fruitless idea, a monument of wasted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> and frustrated hopes.<span class='page-number' id='s-896' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.896]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/a-national-university","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Mustafa Kamal Pasha","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/mustafa-kamal-pasha","prvt":"The Glory of God in Man","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-glory-of-god-in-man","dt":"1908-02-24","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["mustafa-kamal-pasha"],"t":"Mustafa Kamal Pasha","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We published yesterday among our selections a full account of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of Mustafa Kamal Pasha, the great Nationalist leader in Egypt, who has regenerated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> in his motherland and will be remembered in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> as the chief among the creators of modern Egypt. The early death of this extraordinary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> will be a blow to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, but we must remember what we are apt to forget that the life-work of a great man often does not begin till he dies. While the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> fetters the activities of the spirit within, his work is limited in its scope and imperfect in its intensity, but when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> shackles are struck off by the friendly hand of death then the spirit ranges abroad in perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> and the sudden and startling rapidity with which its work develops, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> a theme for the amazement and admiration of posterity. Whatever else Mustafa Kamal may have been, he was a sincere and enthusiastic patriot. When he left Egypt to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the cause of his country in foreign countries, he was welcomed even in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> by those who had the generosity to appreciate patriotism; but the moment it appeared that his work was beginning to bear practical fruit in Egypt itself, a storm of misrepresentation began to beat about his devoted head which has not even yet ceased. He was denounced as an intriguer, a paid tool of the Khedive, a Turcophil emissary of the Sultan. But Egypt felt the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of a patriot in his writings and his speeches and her people responded to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span>. The steady growth of the Nationalist party has been mainly the work of Mustafa Kamal. It attained its consummation in the meeting of the reorganized Nationalist party when he was on the brink of the grave and his last self-forgetful service to his country was the<span class='page-number' id='s-897' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.897]</span> speech which he rose from his death-bed to deliver upon that memorable occasion.\n\nThe programme of the Nationalist party in Egypt has some resemblances to that of the Indian Nationalists. Its object is the independence of Egypt, its method is the appeal to the self-consciousness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, and its reliance is on the help which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> always gives to the cause of righteousness when it is pursued in a lofty and disinterested spirit. In his earlier career Mustafa relied too much on foreign sympathy and he persisted till the end in clinging to the hope of some assistance, moral if not material, from the foreign powers financially interested in Egypt. But his trust in this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of outward help never extended to the folly of expecting British statesmen to co-operate of deliberate purpose in hastening the day of Egypt's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>. He was a statesman as well as a prophet of Nationalism. If he relied too much on foreign sympathy, it was because the national sentiment in Egypt was as yet local and he trusted in the moral support of other countries to prevent England from putting it down with the strong hand before it had become sufficiently self-conscious to survive oppression. The Sultan stood between Egypt and complete annexation to England, and therefore he always persisted in laying stress on the suzerainty of the Sultan. The religious solidarity of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span> was a moral asset in his favour and he insisted on this solidarity but never suffered it for a moment to interfere with the distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of Egyptian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span>. The cause of nationality was his first object; the rest merely helps and supports. Towards the end of his career as the sentiment of nationality grew more and more self-conscious and self-reliant in his countrymen he too came to perceive in its fullness the truth that Egypt must rely on herself first and not on others. Foreign help can only be safe and beneficial if the nation has already grown strong enough to rely mainly on itself for its own separate existence.\n\nMustafa Kamal was a man of the type of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> respect, his intense idealism and lofty idea of cosmopolitan unity embracing national independence. It is this idealism which will keep Egypt alive and secure the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span> of the Nationalist<span class='page-number' id='s-898' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.898]</span> movement. When a movement for independence begins with diplomacy and Machiavellianism, it is doomed to failure as the Carbonari movement failed in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span>. God is not with it. It does not rely on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> principles of truth and virtue, but on the finite strength of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and human means and to that finite strength God leaves it. When that strength comes to its limits, there is nothing left, and failure is final. But when a movement takes its stand on truth and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, then it appeals to God Himself and He will see to it that the trust reposed in Him is not falsified. Failures may come but they will be only fresh incentives to purer and nobler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>. An immortal power will stand behind the movement and death will be afraid to come near it. Its leaders may be snatched away by the hand of death, hurried into exile or imprisonment, given to the hand of the executioner, but fresh leaders will arise. Its means may change from time to time, it may pass through ever-new phases and sometimes men may fail to recognize it as the same old movement, but God is within it always as its eternal and undying Self and it lasts till it receives its consummation.<span class='page-number' id='s-899' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.899]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/mustafa-kamal-pasha","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"A Great Opportunity","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-great-opportunity","prvt":"A National University","prvu":"/cwsa/07/a-national-university","dt":"1908-03-03","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-great-opportunity"],"t":"A Great Opportunity","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The release of Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal will take place in a few days and the bureaucracy is undoubtedly looking with anxiety to see what kind of reception the people give to this great leader and propagandist after his six months' incarceration for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>' sake.

That his services to the country have been of an incalculable value, few will care to gainsay. Among a large section of his countrymen he is recognized as the prophet of a great political creed. Whenever men of his type fall under the displeasure of the powers that be, they return to the field of work with greater vigour and a fresh vitality, for theirs is a mission which thrives upon oppression and gains by exile and imprisonment. Srijut Bipin Chandra also will come out of prison like a giant refreshed and renew his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. But if his incarceration had been a source of strength to himself, has it or has it not been a source of strength to his country? This is the question which we must answer on the 9th of March. In what terms shall we answer it? Are we to confess that the cunning policy of mingled repression and occasional forbearance has had its effect? There are some among us who advise caution and look with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> on such demonstrations as likely to provoke fresh persecution, as<span class='page-number' id='s-900' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.900]</span> if it were the outward ebullitions of sentiment and not the fact of national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> which it is sought to repress. Shall we by an imperfect welcome to this great tribune of the people show that these counsels of imprudent prudence have weight with us? Shall we not rather make the occasion one of universal rejoicing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> over the country so that all may feel that the pulse of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> is not slower, that the heart of this people beats as high as before the incarceration of their well-loved apostle and teacher?\n\nHow then are we to welcome Bipin Chandra Pal back to the scene of his labours? By illuminations, by processions, by rejoicing of every kind. We would have every town and village where the nation is awake write his welcome in letters of fire on balcony and roof of their dwellings not only in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> but in Madras, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span>, in the Punjab, wherever <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> is alive and the name of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span> is honoured. We invite our countrymen all over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> to become one with Bengal in the act of a rejoicing which is not for a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> but for the cause he has served. Let us also arrange to lead him in procession from his house after his return to a place of public meeting with such pomp and ceremony as befits one who returns from a great victory to his native land; for the jail is a place of exile and the prisoner released is a soldier who has waged a great moral conflict for his country and returns triumphant carrying with him his unblemished patriotism and the unlowered flag of his courage as the trophies of the fight. And in the place of assembly let all parties unite to do him honour so that the return of this Nationalist leader may be the best answer to those who rejoice in our dissensions and seek in them the safety which they cannot hope for from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> of their bureaucratic rule or the righteousness of their absolutist cause. And if in addition every considerable society of workers and patriots expresses separately its appreciation and respect, the welcome will be worthy of the occasion, and a great opportunity for fresh national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> and the upwelling of a living enthusiasm will have been nobly used. Whoever thinks that this is a time for nourishing old grudges or remembering past feuds, is wanting in patriotism and insight. The hour is one<span class='page-number' id='s-901' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.901]</span> of growing national unity and there is in the heart of the people a desire to have done with barren dispute and set themselves to the sacred work to which this generation has been called. Whoever stops now to weigh and consider whether he is at one with Bipin Chandra in the views of which he is the chief exponent or can entirely appreciate the reasons of his refusal to give evidence, is allowing trifles to obscure the greatness of the thing which Bipin Chandra for the moment represents. It is not the man or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> which will be honoured by a public demonstration. The man is nothing but the cause is everything. The action is nothing, but the sacrament of suffering is everything. This sacrament of suffering has been in this instance the privilege not of the rank and file of the national army but of a great leader and captain, whose name is honoured in every part of India. Such an occasion is one of rare occurrence, for it is usually the private soldiers who are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>food</span> for powder and the leaders stand out of range for the better safety of the work. Yet when one is struck down, it is a matter for national rejoicing, that so illustrious a name has been added to the roll of those who have been chosen to give proofs of the noblest patriotism and courage.\n\nWe therefore invite all to join in this demonstration. We do not wish this occasion to be marred by the memories of past dissension but to be ennobled by the growing hope of a great united movement forward in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. In the person of Bipin Chandra let the present impulse towards a better understanding find a consummation which all the world cannot fail to understand. Let it be the seal of the reconciliation which began at Pabna, and the beginning of united action for the better organisation of the work to which all Bengal without distinction of parties is now irrevocably pledged.<span class='page-number' id='s-902' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.902]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/a-great-opportunity","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Swaraj and the Coming Anarchy","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/swaraj-and-the-coming-anarchy","prvt":"Mustafa Kamal Pasha","prvu":"/cwsa/07/mustafa-kamal-pasha","dt":"1908-03-04","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["swaraj-and-the-coming-anarchy"],"t":"Swaraj and the Coming Anarchy","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Whoever tries to read the signs of the time, will be no little perplexed at first by their complexity. The beginnings of a great revolution which is destined to change the whole political, social, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>economic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span></span> of a great country, are always full of ebb and flow, perplexing by the multitude of details and their continual interaction. The struggle going on at Tuticorin exemplifies this remarkable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>diversity</span> and intermingling of numerous tendencies each of which would in ordinary times be a separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. Society is full of anomalies which clash and jostle together in an inextricable chaos of progress and reaction; economic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> is in the throes of a violent transition from the old mediaeval basis of life to the modern; politics is at a parting of the ways. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> these various and independent activities of the Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> politic unite into a huge and confused movement of which the main impulse is political and the others are largely inspired, if not motived, by the passions which are at the root of the political upheaval. Great issues of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>economics</span> wear the guise of a political conflict; immense political aspirations become mixed up with a purely industrial struggle between indigenous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> and foreign capital. So also in society the old reform movement which was a separate and ineffectual attempt to transform our society according to European ideas, has given place to disquiet and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> in the society itself. So long the educated men of the upper castes debated among themselves about the better ordering of society, and outside <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> and the Punjab it was no better than an academic dispute on the Social Conference platform or between the reforming and orthodox Press. Even in Bengal and the Punjab, the movement was sectional, a revolt of<span class='page-number' id='s-903' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.903]</span> a small minority of the educated few, and did not touch the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the people. So far as society as a whole was affected, it was by the new environments of the nineteenth century bringing an irresistible pressure to bear on its outworks, and sometimes by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of economical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> born of the modern conditions of India under British rule. The change was from outside and therefore injurious rather than beneficial, for an organism is doomed which, incapable of changing from within, answers only to the pressure of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>. But this immobile state of Hindu society has now begun to pass away and we see the beginning of a profound and incalculable life in the heart of the great organism. Yesterday we hardly needed to reckon with the lower strata of society in our political life; today they are beginning to live, to move, to have a dim inarticulate hope and to grope for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> and room. That is a sign of coming social revolution in which neither the conservative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> of society nor the liberal sympathies of the educated few will have much voice. The forces that are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> unprisoned, will upheave the whole of our society with a volcanic force and the shape it will take after the eruption is over, does not depend on the wishes or the wisdom of men. These social stirrings also are mingling with the political unrest to increase the confusion. The question of the Namasudras in Bengal has become a political as well as a social problem and in other parts of the country also the line between politics and social questions is threatened with obliteration.\n\nThe <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> is not in our hands. When so huge a problem stares us in the face, we become conscious of the limits of human discernment and wisdom. We at once feel that the motions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> are determined by forces and not by individuals and that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and experience of statesmen are merely instruments in the hands of the Power which manifests itself in those great incalculable forces. In ordinary times, we are apt to forget this and to account for all that happens as the result of this statesman's foresight or that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>' dynamic personality. But in times like the present we find it less easy to shut our eyes to the truth. We do not affect to believe, therefore, that we can discover any solution of these great problems or any<span class='page-number' id='s-904' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.904]</span> sure line of policy by which the tangled issues of so immense a movement can be kept free from the possibility of inextricable anarchy in the near future. Anarchy will come. This peaceful and inert <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> is going to be rudely awakened from a century of passivity and flung into a world-shaking turmoil out of which it will come transformed, strengthened and purified. There is a chaos which is the result of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span> and the prelude of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, and this was the state of India during the last century. The British peace of the last fifty years was like the quiet green grass and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>flowers</span> covering the corruption of a sepulchre. There is another chaos which is the violent reassertion of life and it is this chaos into which India is being hurried today. We cannot repine at the change, but are rather ready to welcome the pangs which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the storm which purifies, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> which renovates.\n\n<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> thing only we are sure of, and one thing we wear as a life-belt which will buoy us up on the waves of the chaos that is coming on the land. This is the fixed and unalterable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in an overruling Purpose which is raising India once more from the dead, the fixed and unalterable intention to fight for the renovation of her ancient life and glory.

If a great social revolution is necessary, it is because the ideal of Swaraj cannot be accomplished by a nation bound to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> which are no longer expressive of the ancient and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span> Self of India. She must change the rags of the past so that her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> may be readorned. She must alter her bodily appearance so that her soul may be newly expressed.

Her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span> is too mighty for such a degradation, her soul too <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>calm</span> and self-sufficient for such a surrender. If again an economical revolution is inevitable, it is because the fine but narrow edifice of her old industrial life will not allow of Swaraj in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span> and industry. The industrial energies of a free and perfect national life demand a mightier scope and wider channels. Neither need we fear that the economic revolution will land us in the same diseased and disordered state of society as now offends the nobler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of humanity in Europe.

If perfect simplicity of life, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> from economic evils, from moral degradation, from the strife, faction and fury of town populations, from revolution and turmoil, from vice and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> on a large scale are the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> of social organization, then the village communities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> were ideal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of social organization. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> look back to them with regret and even British administrators who were instrumental in destroying them have wished that they could be revived. So valuable indeed were the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of social welfare which they secured to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, that they have persisted through <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> changes and revolutions as they were thousands of years ago when the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aryan</span> first occupied the land. Nor can it be denied that they have kept the nation alive. Whatever social evils or political diseases might corrupt the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> politic, these little cells of national life supplied a constant source of soundness and purity which helped to prevent final <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span>. But if we owe national permanence to these village organizations, it<span class='page-number' id='s-907' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.907]</span> cannot be denied that they have stood in the way of national unity.\n\nWherever a nation has been formed, in the modern sense, it has been at the expense of smaller units. The whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of national growth is the record of a long struggle to establish a central unity by subduing the tendency of smaller units to live to themselves. The ancient polity of Greece was the self-realisation of the city as an unit sufficient to itself while the deme or village was obliged to sacrifice its separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> to the greater unity of the city-state. Because the Greeks could not find it in their hearts to break the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> and perfect mould of their self-sufficient city life, they could never weld themselves into a nation. So again it was not till the Romans had subdued the tendency of the Italian cities to live to themselves, that the first European nation was created. In mediaeval times the city-state tried to reassert itself in the Municipalities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>France</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Germany</span> and municipal freedom had to be blotted out by an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>monarchy</span> before national unity was realised. Whenever a smaller or different unity, whether it be that of the province, the church or the feudal fief, tends to live for itself, it is an obstacle to national unity and has to be either broken up or subordinated if the nation is to fulfil its unity. Ancient India could not build itself into a single united nation, not because of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> or social differences as the European writers assert,â€”caste and class have existed in nations which achieved a faultless national unity,â€”but because the old polity of the Hindus allowed the village to live to itself, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>clan</span> to live to itself, the province or smaller race-unit to live to itself. The village, sufficient to itself, took no interest in the great wars and revolutions which affected only the ruling clans of the kingdom including it in its territorial jurisdiction. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span> clans fought and married and made peace among themselves, and were the only political units out of which a nation might have been built. But the clan too was so attached to its separate existence that it was not till the clans were destroyed on the battlefield of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kurukshetra</span> that larger national units could be built out of their ruins. Small kingdoms took their place based on provincial or racial divisions and until<span class='page-number' id='s-908' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.908]</span> the inrush of foreign peoples an attempt was in progress to build them into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> nation by the superimposition of a single imperial authority. Many causes prevented the success of the attempt, and the provincial unit has always remained the highest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the nation-building tendencies in India. One cause perhaps more than any other contributed to the failure of the centripetal tendency to attain self-fulfilment, and that was the persistence of the village <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> which prevented the people, the real nation, from taking any part in the great struggles out of which a nation should have emerged. In other countries the people had to take part in the triumphs, disasters and failures of their rulers either as citizens or at least as soldiers, but in India they were left to their little isolated republics with no farther interest than the payment of a settled tax in return for protection by the supreme power. This was the true cause of the failure of India to achieve a distinct organized and self-conscious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span>. It is worthy of notice that the Indian race in which the national idea attained its most conscious expression and most nearly attained realization, was the Mahratta people who drew their strength from the village democracies and brought them to interest themselves in the struggle for national independence. If the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahrattas</span> had been able to rise above the idea of provincial or racial separateness, they would have established a permanent empire and neither of the Wellesleys could have broken their power by diplomacy or in the field. The British, historians have told us, conquered India in a fit of absence of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span>. In a fit of absence of mind also they destroyed the separate life of our village communities and, by thus removing the greatest obstacle in the way of national development, prepared the irresistible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> towards national unity which now fills them with dismay. The provinces have been brought together, the village has been destroyed. It only remains for the people to fulfil their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>.\n\nWe are now turning our eyes again to the village under the stress of an instinct of self-preservation and part of our programme is to recreate village organization. In doing so we must always remember that the village can be so organized as to<span class='page-number' id='s-909' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.909]</span> prove a serious obstacle to national cohesion. One or two of our leading publicists have sometimes expressed themselves as if our salvation lay in the village and not in the larger organization of the nation. Swaraj has been sometimes interpreted as a return to the old conditions of self-sufficient village life leaving the imperial authority to itself, to tax and pass laws as it pleasedâ€”ignored because it is too strong to be destroyed. Even those who see the futility of ignoring <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> which seeks to destroy every centre of strength, however minute, except itself, sometimes insist on the village as the secret of our life and ask us to give up our ambitious strivings after national Swaraj and realise it first in the village. Such counsel is dangerous, even if it were possible to follow it. Nothing should be allowed to distract us from the mighty ideal of Swaraj, national and pan-Indian. This is no alien or exotic ideal, it is merely the conscious attempt to fulfil the great centripetal tendency which has pervaded the grandiose millenniums of her history, to complete the work which Srikrishna began, which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chandragupta</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asoka</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gupta</span> Kings continued, which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Akbar</span> almost brought to realisation, for which Shivaji was born and Bajirao fought and planned. The organization of our villages is an indispensable work to which we must immediately set our hands, but we must be careful so to organize them as to make them feel that they are imperfect parts of a single national unity, and dependent at every turn on the co-operation first of the district, secondly of the province, and finally of the nation. The day of the independent village or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> of villages has gone and must not be revived; the nation demands its hour of fulfilment and seeks to gather the village life of its rural population into a mighty, single and compact democratic nationality. We must make the nation what the village community was of old, self-sufficient, self-centred, autonomous and exclusiveâ€”the ideal of national Swaraj.<span class='page-number' id='s-910' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.910]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-village-and-the-nation","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Welcome to the Prophet of Nationalism","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/welcome-to-the-prophet-of-nationalism","prvt":"Swaraj and the Coming Anarchy","prvu":"/cwsa/07/swaraj-and-the-coming-anarchy","dt":"1908-03-07","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["welcome-to-the-prophet-of-nationalism"],"t":"Welcome to the Prophet of Nationalism","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Today Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal is due in Calcutta, a free <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> once more until it shall please irresponsible Magistrates and easily-twisted laws to repeat his seclusion from the work which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> has given him to do.

The price of safety, if he <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> it, is the sacrifice of his soul, to be silent when God has bidden him to speak, to refrain from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> which his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> on him to perform.

Recantation was the alternative which the old persecutors of<span class='page-number' id='s-911' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.911]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span> and the Christian persecutors of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Jews</span> and heretics offered to those whom they threatened with the cross and the arena, with the rack and the fire, and it was offered for the same reason that it is offered today to the political martyr. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> with which the old religious persecutors had to struggle was a moral force which fought tyranny not with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> weapons but with the weapons of the spirit and it was by intimidating the spirit and breaking the moral force of the resistance that they hoped to destroy the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> which they feared.\n\nRecantation meant a diminution of the moral force of the movement, so much to the credit of the tyrant, to the loss of the cause. Today also it is a great religious movement disguised for the moment in a political and Western garb with which the bureaucracy is faced and the weapons which it uses are the weapons of the spirit, the force which makes it formidable is a spiritual force. We have nothing to oppose to the immense material engines of the bureaucracy except the exalted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>, the unflinching courage, the unswerving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> to principle which has been so strangely, suddenly born in the hearts of this generation of young men in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. There lies the true strength of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> and the enemies of Nationalism instinctively feel it. They are concerned therefore not so much to crush the inadequate and rudimentary material means which the movement has so far generated but to destroy the moral force which makes it a power. They are willing to forego the satisfaction of vindictiveness if they can secure the solid advantage of an apology or recantation of some kind such as would fatally injure the moral force of at least one champion of Nationalism and by cumulative examples beat down the enthusiastic self-confidence of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. Once or twice they have succeeded, but these solitary instances of weakness have been a beacon-light of warning to the country and the stern resolution not to flinch has been strengthened by the perception of the incalculable harm a single instance of recantation can do to the whole cause. On the other hand everyone who can say to the bureaucratic tempter, \"Get thee behind me, Satan,\" is scoring a victory for the cause of his country.<span class='page-number' id='s-912' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.912]</span>\n\nYet there are signs that the counsels of prudence and the wisdom of the diplomat are beginning to gain upon us, we are growing wise in our generation and calculate the harm that can be done to the success of the movement by rashness or the advantages to be gained by a little care and economy of life or suffering. The exaltation of the movement is in danger of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> lowered by an accommodating spirit. We have referred before to this growing danger and we are led to dwell on it by a perception of the relaxation in popular enthusiasm and fire which is apparent in Bengal.

The voice of the prophet will once more be free to speak to our hearts, the voice through which God has more than once spoken. We shall remember once more that the movement is a spiritual movement for prophets, martyrs and heroes to inspire, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> and lead, not for diplomats and pinchbeck Machiavels; we shall realise that the spirit of India reawakened is the life of the movement and not a borrowed Western patriotism; we shall shrink once more from accommodation and paltering with the high call of our conscience as a fatal concession to the adversary and feel again that only by perfect faith, perfect self-sacrifice, perfect courage can we generate that Brahmatej in the nation which will raise up the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span> spirit to protect it.

Today let us recall what it is that they expect from us; forgetting for a while our selfish preoccupations, our little fears, our petty ambitions, let us identify ourselves in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> with these nobler spirits whom it is our privilege to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> fellow-countrymen, and ask ourselves whether we are really working to bring about the great ideal for which they have immolated themselves. Who is there who<span class='page-number' id='s-915' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.915]</span> can really say that his work is worthy of these heroic martyrs? Prometheus chained to the rock and gnawed by the vulture's beak endured in the strong hope of man's final deliverance from the tyrant powers of the middle-heaven who sought to keep him from his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>; but the human race for whom he suffered forgot Prometheus, forgot the dazzling hope to which his life had pointed them and, involved in petty cares and mean ambitions, allowed their champion to suffer in vain and their destiny to call them to no purpose. We, like the woman whom <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span> censured, the careful, prudent woman of the world, are busied with many things, but forget the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> thing needful. We are waiting to see whether the Congress will be revived or not, or we are watching the progress of Swadeshi with self-satisfaction, or we are anxious for this or that National School, while the fight for Swaraj seems to have ceased or passed away from us into worthier hands. Madras has taken up the *herol* out of our hands, and today it is over Tuticorin that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gods</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span> hover in their aerial cars watching the chances of the fight which is to bring back the glorious days of old. Gallant Chidambaram, brave Padmanabha, intrepid Shiva defying the threats of exile and imprisonment, fighting for the masses, for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, for the preparation of Swaraj, these are now in the forefront, the men of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>, the bearers of the standard. The spirit of active heroism and self-immolation has travelled southward. In Bengal the spirit of passive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span> is all that seems to remain and the bold initiative, the fiery spirit that panted to advance is dead or sleeping. \"Work, there is no need to aspire; labour for small things and the great will come in some future generation\", is the spirit which seems to be in the ascendant. But the voices of the martyrs from their cells cry to us in a different key, \"Work, but aspire, so that your work may be true to the call you have heard and which we have obeyed; labour for great things first and the small will come of themselves. Cherish the might of the spirit, the nobility of the ideal, the grandeur of the dream; the spirit will create the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> it needs, the ideal will bring the real to its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and self-expression, the dream is the stuff out of which the waking world will be created.

In the former case the country at large is not interested in the result, for a party organization is free to make the arrangements most suitable to itself. But if the Congress is to be a Congress of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> opinions and not of one section only, the Constitution must be so drafted as to remove the causes of quarrel which led up to the Surat fiasco. One of these was the conflict between authority and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> in the proceedings of the session. The Moderates stand for official authority, the Nationalists for the freedom of debate and the rights of the delegate as a popular representative. The conflict between the Chairman of the Reception Committee and Mr. Tilak was on the issue whether the authority of the President or Chairman is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> and autocratic or whether the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> delegate has a right to be heard according to the rules observed in all free assemblies and to appeal to the full assembly if his right is unjustly denied. The Moderates desire to establish a sort of official <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oligarchy</span> in the Congress; the leaders, officially recognised in previous years, must be implicitly obeyed; the voice of the President is to be absolute and final irrespective of the validity of his decision or the rights of free discussion. The Nationalists contend that the President is a servant of the Congress and not its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span>: his function is to administer the<span class='page-number' id='s-917' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.917]</span> rules of debate and not to make his own will and pleasure the law. There can be no doubt which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> is in consonance with the practice of free peoples, the spirit of modern politics and the principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span>. Mr. Tilak has established his position by his articles in the *Kesari* and *Mahratta* with the most crushing completeness and there is no possible answer to the array of authorities, precedents and sound argument which he has marshalled in those pieces of perfect political reasoning unrivalled in their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> and clearness of exposition. Whoever wishes to draft a constitution for the Congress must take this great issue into consideration and lay down clearly, first the powers of the President and their limits, secondly the proper procedure with regard to the Subjects Committee, and thirdly, the rights of the delegates in full Congress as against the President and the Subjects Committee. We propose to take up this question of the constitution and deal with it at length, for it is a subject of immense importance and it is essential that those who handle it should try to grasp the principles involved.

Therefore he was removed for a while from the busy scene which was so largely filled with his great personality and far-sounding eloquence, removed by a means which man would never have dreamed of, by a chain of petty circumstances which seemed mere fortuity so that for six months his soul might be alone with itself and he might take stock of his personal strength and weakness and realize that his strength was not his own but God's, his eloquence was not his own but God's, his fruitful, strong and subtle <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> was not his own but God's. When we heard him on Tuesday avow the struggle in his soul and its deep consequence, we felt once more convinced of the divine workings. All great teachers have to go through this hour of lonely self-communion and deep mental travail in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> that they may learn the nature of their commission and whence it proceeds. It is only after this hour has come to them that their mission really begins, and all that went before was merely a preparation for that hour; for they must feel the power within them before they can realise who gave them the power. Bipin Chandra went to prison, the leader of a section and the spokesman of a party; but if he lives in the revelation he has received in his sojourn in the desert, he will be in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> something far greater, and become the prophet and inspirer of a nation consecrated to that mission by<span class='page-number' id='s-922' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.922]</span> a power whose wisdom will lead him and whose strength will protect throughout the struggle that lies in front. Others, we hope, will realize the meaning of the words which fell from him in his first utterance after his return. There are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> powerful spirits now in the ranks of Nationalism who have also their share of the work, some of whom are still under the influence of egoism and believe that by their own skill, courage and ability they will bring the movement to a success.

In the first place a great thought entered into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the people and displaced the petty indignation against an administrative measure which was the immediate cause of the Boycott. Swaraj displaced the idea of a mere administrative unity and Swaraj is too mighty an object to be effected by a single and limited means. Secondly, the first magnificent unity of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> was lost. The Mahomedans, lured by specious promises, broke away from the ranks and within the circle of the leaders themselves a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> arose between those who believed in Swaraj pure and unadulterated and those whom policy or caution dissuaded from so mighty an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>. For passive resistance to succeed unity, perseverance and thoroughness are the first requisites. Because this unity, perseverance and thoroughness existed in Tuticorin, the great battle fought over the Coral Mill has ended in a great and indeed absolutely sweeping victory for the people. Every claim made by the strikers has been conceded and British capital has had to submit to the humiliation of an unconditional surrender. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> may well take pride in the gallant leaders who have by their cool and unflinching<span class='page-number' id='s-924' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.924]</span> courage brought about this splendid vindication of Nationalist teaching.

We refer to the struggle in the Transvaal which was carried on with equal unity, perseverance and thoroughness to a success less absolutely unconditional but even more striking from the strength and stubbornness of the enemy it had to overcome. We publish in another column a letter from a brother in the Transvaal on the subject. The conditions of political struggle in the Transvaal are different, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> less vast than those of the movement in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. The Transvaal Indians demand only the ordinary rights of human <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beings</span> in modern civilized society, the right to live, the right to trade, to be treated like human beings and not like cattle. In India which is our own country, our aspirations have a larger sweep and our methods must be more varied and strenuous. Moreover, in the Transvaal the Asiatics form a small and distinct <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> in a foreign and hostile <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> and can more easily rise above petty differences of creed and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>, opinion and interest; but in this vast continent with its huge population of thirty crores and its complex tangle of diversities the task is more difficult, even as the prize of success is more splendid. The unity will be longer in coming, the perseverance more difficult to maintain, the thoroughness less perfect; but the might of three hundred millions welded into a single <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> will be a potency so gigantic that the imagination fails to put a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> to the final results of the movement now in its infancy.\n\nMeanwhile, the lesson of Tuticorin, the lesson of the Transvaal is one which needs to be learnt and put frequently into practice. We should lose no opportunity of letting our strength grow by practice. There have been <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> struggles in Bengal, but with the exception of the Printers' strike none has<span class='page-number' id='s-925' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.925]</span> ended in a victory for Indian labour against British capital. Either the unity among the operatives was defective or the support of the public was absent or the perseverance and thoroughness of the strike was marred by hesitations, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> submissions, partial concessions. The Tuticorin strike is a perfect example of what an isolated labour revolt should be. The operatives must act with one will and speak with one voice, never letting the temptation of individual interest or individual relief get the better of the corporate aim in which lies the whole strength of a labour combination, and the educated community must give both moral and financial support with an ungrudging and untiring enthusiasm till the victory is won, realising that every victory for Indian labour is a victory for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and every defeat a defeat to the movement. The Tuticorin leaders must be given the whole credit for the unequalled skill and courage with which the fight was conducted and still more for the complete realization of the true inwardness of the Nationalist gospel which made them identify the interests of the whole Indian nation with the wrongs and grievances of the labourers in the Coral Mill.<span class='page-number' id='s-926' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.926]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-tuticorin-victory","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Perpetuate the Split!","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/perpetuate-the-split","prvt":"A Great Message","prvu":"/cwsa/07/a-great-message","dt":"1908-03-13","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["perpetuate-the-split"],"t":"Perpetuate the Split!","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The Mehtaist Press in Western <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> seems to be unable to make up its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> for a compromise or against a compromise.

Their chief organ openly declared that it had been the Moderate plan to get rid of passive resistance and other Extremist heresies which had been read into the Calcutta resolution by the Extremists. The *Gujerati* is equally plain about the creed, its object is to get rid of the spectre of Swaraj by exorcism and the creed is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> formula which is to drive Swaraj and Swarajists out of the National Assembly.

When <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedanism</span> appeared, Christianity vanished out of Asia, because it had lost its meaning. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomed</span> tried to re-establish the Asiatic gospel of human equality in the spirit. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> men are equal in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span>, whatever their social position or political power, nor is any man debarred from the full development of his manhood by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span><span class='page-number' id='s-929' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.929]</span> or low original station in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. All men are brothers in Islam and the bond of religious unity overrides all other divisions and differences. But Islam also was limited and imperfect, because it confined the ideal of brotherhood and equality to the limits of a single creed, and was farther deflected from its true path by the rude and undeveloped races which it drew into its embrace. Another revelation of the old truth is needed.\n\nIndia from ancient times had received the gospel of Vedanta which sought to establish the divine unity of man in spirit; but in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to secure an ordered society in which she could develop her spiritual insight and perfect her civilization, she had invented the system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> which by corruptions and departures from caste ideals came to be an obstacle to the fulfilment in society of the Vedantic ideal. From the time of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span> to that of the saints of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maharashtra</span> every great religious awakening has sought to restore the ancient meaning of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hinduism</span> and reduce caste to its original subordinate importance as a social convenience, to exorcise the spirit of caste pride and restore that of brotherhood and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> in society. But the feudal spirit had taken possession of India and the feudal spirit is wedded to inequality and the pride of caste.\n\nWhen the feudal system was broken in Europe by the rise of the middle class, the ideals of Christianity began to emerge once more to light, but by this time the Christian Church had itself become feudalized, and the curious spectacle presents itself of Christian ideals struggling to establish themselves by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> of the very institution which had been created to preserve Christianity. When the ideals of liberty, equality and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fraternity</span> were declared at the time of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>French Revolution</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> demanded that society should recognise them as the foundation of its structure, they were associated with a fierce revolt against the relics of feudalism and against the travesty of the Christian religion which had become an integral part of that feudalism. This was the weakness of European democracy and the source of its failure. It took as its motive the rights of man and not the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>* of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>; it appealed to the selfishness of the lower <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> against the pride of the upper; it made <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span><span class='page-number' id='s-930' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.930]</span> and internecine war the permanent allies of Christian ideals and wrought an inextricable confusion which is the modern malady of Europe. It was in vain that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> rediscovered the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of Christianity and sought to remodel European ideas; the French Revolution had become the starting point of European democracy and coloured the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European mind</span>. Now that democracy has returned to Asia, its cradle and home, it will be purged of its foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> and restored to its original purity. The movements of the nineteenth century in India were European movements, they were coloured with the hues of the West. Instead of seeking for strength in the spirit, they adopted the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> and motives of Europe, the appeal to the rights of humanity or the equality of social status and an impossible dead level which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> has always refused to allow. Mingled with these false gospels was a strain of hatred and bitterness, which showed itself in the condemnation of Brahminical priestcraft, the hostility to Hinduism and the ignorant breaking away from the hallowed traditions of the past. What was true and eternal in that past was likened to what was false or transitory, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> was in danger of losing its soul by an insensate surrender to the aberrations of European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span>. Not in this spirit was India intended to receive the mighty opportunity which the impact of Europe gave to her. When the danger was greatest, a number of great spirits were sent to stem the tide flowing in from the West and recall her to her mission; for, if she had gone astray the world would have gone astray with her.\n\nHer mission is to point back humanity to the true source of human liberty, human equality, human brotherhood. When man is free in spirit, all other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> is at his command; for the Free is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> who cannot be bound. When he is liberated from delusion, he perceives the divine equality of the world which fulfils itself through love and justice, and this perception transfuses itself into the law of government and society. When he has perceived this divine equality, he is brother to the whole world, and in whatever position he is placed he serves all men as his brothers by the law of love, by the law of justice. When this<span class='page-number' id='s-931' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.931]</span> perception becomes the basis of religion, of philosophy, of social speculation and political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>, then will liberty, equality and fraternity take their place in the structure of society and the Satya Yuga return. This is the Asiatic reading of democracy which India must rediscover for herself before she can give it to the world. It is the *dharma* of every man to be free in soul, bound to service not by compulsion but by love; to be equal in spirit, apportioned his place in society by his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> to serve society, not by the interested selfishness of others; to be in harmonious relations with his brother men, linked to them by mutual love and service, not by shackles of servitude, or the relations of the exploiter and the exploited, the eater and the eaten. It has been said that democracy is based on the rights of man; it has been replied that it should rather take its stand on the duties of man; but both rights and duties are European ideas. Dharma is the Indian conception in which rights and duties lose the artificial antagonism created by a view of the world which makes selfishness the root of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, and regain their deep and eternal unity. Dharma is the basis of democracy which Asia must recognise, for in this lies the distinction between the soul of Asia and the soul of Europe. Through Dharma the Asiatic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> fulfils itself; this is her secret.<span class='page-number' id='s-932' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.932]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/asiatic-democracy","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Charter or No Charter","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/charter-or-no-charter","prvt":"Loyalty to Order","prvu":"/cwsa/07/loyalty-to-order","dt":"1908-03-16","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["charter-or-no-charter"],"t":"Charter or No Charter","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We have already said what we had to say on Mrs. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Besant</span>'s idea of a National University. In her speech on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span> delivered at the Corinthian Theatre, she referred again to the subject of the Charter and invited the National Council of Education to get a Royal Charter to confer degrees.

So with the proposed Charter. Mrs. Besant gives away her case when she admits that the Charter is a guarantee for the education given in the University. Certainly, the authority having the guarantee has the right to see that the guarantee is not abused and that the education is up to a standard consistent with the dignity of a Royal Charter. This means at least potential State control. In England the control is not exercised, because no public interest can be served by interfering with the work of the educational experts who <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> these Universities, but if the Universities were to fall very much behind in their educational standard, it is conceivable that the potential right of interference might be exercised. If the National Council of Education were to get a Royal Charter, this potential right of interference would be in the hands of the authority issuing the Charter, in other words with the King, which means, for India, with the Secretary of State, which again means with the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy; and we know how that bureaucracy would be likely to use the power. At any moment the Council might have to face the alternative of either accepting practical control by officialdom or sacrificing the Charter; this would mean a crisis which might wreck the new education altogether. Quite apart, therefore, from the sacrifice of that principle of robust independence and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> which is its true strength, the Council would be guilty of an impolitic step, if it accepted, much more if it asked for a Charter. The latter idea is indeed inconceivable. The exclusion of the Council's students from the learned professions means only exclusion from the Government service and the Law, and it is more wholesome for the new institution to be removed from these temptations till it is strong enough to make these professions seek for its students instead of its students seeking<span class='page-number' id='s-933' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.933]</span> for them.

Whence does this fire come or what does it signify? It is a suddenly blazing fire of straw, say the bureaucrats, kindled by the hands of mischievous agitators; it means nothing except that the authors of the mischief must be vigorously repressed. Even if this were true, it is at least a subject which might well cause reflection in minds not blinded by selfish infatuation why it is so easily kindled, why it blazes out so fiercely and in so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> places far apart from each other. Some years ago agitators might have spoken themselves hoarse and yet there would have been no such upsurging of the population of a whole city in reckless revolt against established authority. Still more significant is the defiant spirit of the people which neither the imprisonment of the leaders, nor the shots of the military could quell, but rather lashed into fiercer rage. This is no light fire of straw, but a jet of volcanic fire from the depths, and that has never in the world's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> been conquered by repression.

The lower self is in bondage to its past; the higher is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of the past, the present and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. So the will of the lower self is born of *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ahankara</span>* and limited by *ahankara*, but the will of the higher self is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> *ahankara* and cannot be limited by it. It is omnipotent. But so long as it works through the body, it works under the laws of time, space and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>causality</span>, and we have to wait for its fulfilment till the time is ready, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> prepared, the immediate causes brought about. The will once at work infallibly brings about the necessary conditions; all we have to do is to allow it to work.\n\n---\n\nApply this great psychological law to what is happening in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>. The aspiration towards <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> has for some time been working in some hearts, but they relied on their own strength for the creation of the necessary conditions and they failed. Of those who worked, some gave up the work, others persisted, a few resorted to *tapasya*, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to wake in themselves a higher Power to which they might <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span>. The *tapasya* of those last had its effect unknown to themselves, for they were pouring out a selfless aspiration into the world and the necessary conditions began to be created. When these conditions were far advanced, the second class who worked on began to think that it was the result of their efforts, but the secret springs were hidden from them. They were merely the instruments through which the purer aspiration of their old friends fulfilled itself.\n\n---\n\nIf the conditions of success are to be yet more rapidly brought about, it must be by yet more of the lovers of freedom withdrawing themselves from the effort to work through the lower self. The aspiration of these strong souls purified from self will create fresh workers in the field, infuse the great desire for freedom in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and hasten the growth of the necessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> strength.<span class='page-number' id='s-938' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.938]</span>\n\n---\n\nWhat is needed now is a band of spiritual workers whose *tapasya* will be devoted to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> of India for the service of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. The few <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>associations</span> already started have taken another turn and devoted themselves to special and fragmentary work. We need an institution in which under the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> of highly spiritual men workers will be trained for every field, workers for self-defence, workers for arbitration, for sanitation, for famine relief, for every species of work which is needed to bring about the necessary conditions for the organisation of Swaraj. If the country is to be free, it must first organize itself so as to be able to maintain its freedom. The winning of freedom is an easy task, the keeping of it is less easy. The first needs only one tremendous effort in which all the energies of the country must be concentrated; the second requires an united, organized and settled strength. If these two conditions are satisfied, nothing more is needed, for all else is detail and will inevitably follow. For the first condition the requisite is a mighty selfless faith and aspiration filling the hearts of men as in the day of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span>. For the second India, which has no Piedmont to work out her salvation, requires to organize her scattered strengths into a single and irresistible whole.\n\n---\n\nFor both these ends an institution of the kind we have named is essential. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> of a great stream of aspiration must be poured over the country, which will sweep away as in a flood the hesitations, the selfishnesses, the fears, the self-distrust, the want of fervour and the want of faith which stand in the way of the spread of the great national awakening of 1905. A mightier fountain of the spirit must be prepared from which this stream of aspiration can be poured to fertilise the heart of the nation. When this is done, the aspiration towards liberty will become universal and India be ready for the great effort.\n\n---\n\nThe organization of Swaraj can only be effected by a host of selfless workers who will make it their sole life-work. It cannot<span class='page-number' id='s-939' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.939]</span> be done by men whose best energies and time are given up to the work of earning their daily bread and only the feeble remnant to their country. The work is enormous, the time is short, but the workers are few. One institution is required which will train and support men to help those who are now labouring under great disadvantages to organize <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, to build up the life of the villages, to spread the habit of arbitration, to help the people in time of famine and sickness, to preach Swadeshi. These workers must be selfless, free from the desire to lead or shine, devoted to the work for the country's sake, absolutely obedient yet full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>. They must breathe the strength of the spirit, of selfless faith and aspiration derived from the spiritual guides of the institution. The material is ready and even plentiful, but the factory which will make use of the material has yet to be set on foot. When the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> comes, who is commissioned by God to do it, we must be ready to recognize him.<span class='page-number' id='s-940' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.940]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-need-of-the-moment","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Unity by Co-operation","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/unity-by-co-operation","prvt":"The Warning from Madras","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-warning-from-madras","dt":"1908-03-19","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["unity-by-co-operation"],"t":"Unity by Co-operation","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the little bodies which we are trying to build up for the regeneration of the country, those are the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of strength which come nearest to the ideal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, which bind their members together in a close and affectionate unity, which form a league of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span> and mutual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span>, which without attempting to absorb all into themselves are always ready to come to the assistance of similar societies and of everyone who is in need of help.

What we need is not a single all-embracing organization, but a number of smaller ones harmoniously co-operating together, free from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>jealousy</span>, willing to give the first place to the others, provided the work progresses. The various Samitis which have sprung into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> in Calcutta are all doing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> work, as has been shown by the success of the Ardhodaya Yog arrangements, and they form a source of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span>, little units of strength which are bound to become the basis of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> organization of the country. But these Samitis are at present disconnected and without a connecting bond. They join together when some great occasion calls for their united <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, but they again fall apart as soon as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> is over, and pursue their isolated path. What is needed now is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span> which will keep them in touch with each other without permitting any mutual interference; each unit should be independent in its work and its constitution, but the leaders should be in constant communication so that all the Samitis may be cognizant of each other's work and ready to help whenever help is needed. Moreover when occasion calls for united action the leaders should<span class='page-number' id='s-941' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.941]</span> be in a position to take advantage of each other's help without loss of time; they should feel that they can immediately lay their hands on the strength they stand in need of and apply it at the right place and moment. If this can be done, the recent success at the Ardhodaya Yog will be a starting-point for the better organization of the country and for the beginning of a series of similar successes which will gradually make the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> feel the source of strength within itself and learn to utilise it in every department of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. We are apt to get each absorbed in his own little sphere of action, to set an exaggerated value upon it and try to carry it out by our own unaided and isolated strength, so that the work progresses slowly, is partial, limited and halting in its success and carried on under crushing difficulties which interfere with its perfection and usefulness. There are several Nationalist journals which are doing each in its own line a great work for the country, but they are working in an isolated fashion, each absorbed in its own struggle to survive, each exposed to attack from the same powerful adversary, yet careless of the other,â€”a condition of things which gives enormous advantages to the enemy who is already powerful enough to crush them and would have crushed them long ago if there had not been a greater Power which willed that these little flickering <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lights</span> should not be extinguished. During the Nationalist Conference at Surat it was decided to set on foot a Press Conference for the better preservation of and mutual assistance and constant communication between the papers which are struggling under heart-breaking difficulties, with the constant threat of prosecution hanging over them, to keep the lamp of hope and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> burning in the temple of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>. No further step has been taken in this direction, at least in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, and it is time that it should be taken up in earnest and a Conference of the Nationalist Press in Calcutta arranged by which that Press should become a common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> associated for mutual assistance and support. A typical instance of the difficulties which result from the absence of such a Conference is the temporary disappearance of *New <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>* while Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal was in jail. That disappearance should never have been allowed; as a point of honour, if nothing else, the paper<span class='page-number' id='s-942' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.942]</span> should have been maintained at any cost; but there was no common body, no common action. Each organ of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> was struggling with its own difficulties, absorbed in itself and oblivious of the advantages of co-operation.\n\nThere are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> other departments of work which are suffering from the same want of co-operation between the workers, and it is unnecessary to enumerate them. Each of them should be organised separately on the basis not of an impossible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centralisation</span>, but of harmonious co-operation. When each is united within itself, the higher unity for which we are hoping will naturally come into existence. That organization will be most vital, lasting and sound which comes as a natural growth, developing in answer to growing needs and formed by the closer union of units which have grown up independently and preserved their separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> within the general unity. Life is organic because it evolves from the separate to the united, from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span>, from the cell to the organism, and what we require in India is political life, not a manufactured unity.

In the period of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahabharata</span> we find that the King is merely the head of the race, possessed of executive power but with no right<span class='page-number' id='s-943' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.943]</span> to legislate and even in the exercise of his executive functions unable to transgress by a hair's breadth the laws which are the sum of the customs of the race. Even within this limited scope he cannot act in any important <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> without consulting the chief men of the race who are usually the elders and warriors; often he is a cipher, a dignified President, an ornamental feature of the polity which is in the hands of the nobles. His position is that of first among equals, not that of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> prince or supreme ruler. We find this conception of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>kingship</span> continued till the present day in the Rajput States; at Udaipur, for instance, no alienation of land can take place without the signature of all the nobles; although the Maharaja is the head of the State, the sacred descendant of the Sun, his power is a delegated authority. The rule of the King is hereditary, but only so long as he is approved of by the people. A tyrannical king can be resisted, an unfit heir can be put aside on the representation of the Commons. This idea of kingship is the old Aryan idea, it is limited <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>monarchy</span> and not the type of despotism which is called by the Western writers <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Oriental</span>, though it existed for centuries in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> and has never been universal in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span>.\n\nThe Council of Chiefs is a feature of Indian polity universal in the time of the Mahabharata. That great poem is full of accounts of the meetings of these Councils and some of the most memorable striking events of the story are there transacted. The Udyoga Parva especially gives detailed accounts of the transactions of these Council meetings with the speeches of the princely orators. The King sits as President, hears both sides and seems to decide partly on his own responsibility, partly according to the general sense of the assembly. The opinion of the Council was not decided by votes, an invention of the Greeks, but as in the older Aryan systems, was taken individually from each Councillor. The King was the final arbiter and responsible for the decision, except in nations like the Yadavas where he seems to have been little more than an ornamental head of an aristocratic polity.\n\nFinally, the Commons in the Mahabharata are not represented by any assembly, because the times are evidently a period<span class='page-number' id='s-944' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.944]</span> of war and revolution in which the military <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> had gained an abnormal preponderance. The opinion of the people expresses itself in public demonstrations of spontaneous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, but does not seem to have weighed with the proud and self-confident nobles who ruled them. This feature of the Mahabharata is obviously peculiar to the times, for we find that the Buddhist records preserve to us the true form of ancient Indian polity. The nations among whom <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span> lived were free communities in which the people assembled as in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> and Italian States to decide their own affairs. A still more striking instance of the political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> of the Commons is to be found in the Ramayana. We are told that on the occasion of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> of Rama as Yuvaraj in the government, Dasaratha summoned a sort of States General of the Realm to which delegates of the different provinces and various orders, religious, military and popular were summoned in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to give their sanction to the act of the King. A speech from the throne is delivered in which the King states the reasons for his act, solicits the approval of his people and in case of their refusal of sanction, asks them to meet the situation by a counter-proposal of their own. The assembly then meets \"separately and together\", in other words, the various Orders of the Realm consult first among themselves and then together and decide to give their sanction to the King's proposal.\n\nThe growth of large States in India was fatal to the continuance of the democratic element in the constitution. The idea of representation had not yet been developed, and without the principle of representation democracy is impossible in a large State. The Greeks were obliged to part with their cherished liberty as soon as large States began to enter into the Hellenic world; the Romans were obliged to change their august and cherished institutions for the most absolute form of monarchy as soon as they had become a great Empire; and democracy disappeared from the world until the slow development of the principle of representation enabled the spirit of democracy to find a new body in which it could be reborn.

They resolved to ask the public for funds to present to Srijut Pal as a recognition of his services to the country, well knowing that he would insist on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> utilised for further service to his country instead of for his own personal benefit. Nevertheless certain friends and fellow-workers are under the impression that the purse will be a personal gift to the Nationalist leader to be used for his personal benefit, and they have questioned the suitability of the form which the appreciation of his services has taken. Among others Sj. Rabindranath Tagore while associating himself with the appeal wrote to us suggesting that the question of the advisability of introducing this European form of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> recognition into the more spiritual atmosphere of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> might be publicly discussed in our columns. The question is an important <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> and since it is likely to recur as our political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> develops, it is as well to clear the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>air</span> from the beginning.\n\nThe principle of rewarding distinguished public services by material <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of recognition as well as by honours and titles is common to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> and West; not only so but rank and title were usually associated with the gift of an estate or *jagir* to support the expenditure suitable to the rank and the dignity of the title. Sometimes gifts of land were given by the State without any fresh rank or title either as a reward or as a security for<span class='page-number' id='s-947' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.947]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> service. In modern times the State has no land to give and the only material appreciation it can show of great merit or distinguished services is either a pension or annuity for the former or a vote of money for the latter. An annuity serves the purpose of securing a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> of ability against want and enabling him to devote himself entirely to the work which has procured him the recognition and therefore serves the purpose of securing the future services to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> once guaranteed by the State gift of land. The vote of money on the other hand is usually given to a distinguished man who is above want and is a substitute for the *jagir* of feudal times. No European soldier or statesman, however great his position, his rank or his wealth, would consider it a degradation to accept such a gift from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>.\n\nIn India the State is not the people, and the servants of the people are likely to fall under the displeasure of the State to be persecuted and even ruined by official wrath rather than to enjoy honours, dignities and rewards at its hands. It is therefore the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of the people to show its own appreciation of their services, not because they demand such recognition, but as a duty to itself and an assertion of its own dignity and claims. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Many</span> of those who suffer for its sake are ruined by the persecution of the bureaucrats and leave their families to want or even to destitution, and in such cases the people are bound to come to their assistance. Such funds as the Basanta Bhattacharjee Fund belong to this category, and there can be no question about their fitness, nor can any blot come to the honour of the recipient by his acceptance. But public vote of money to a leader falls under a different head and introduces new questions of propriety. There can be no question either of the right of the public to offer such a substantial mark of recognition or of this right under certain circumstances <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> a duty; and until the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> there would have been no question of the propriety of a public leader accepting such a gift; for in those days the standard was a Western standard and whatever was held right and honourable by the Western standard, was necessarily right and honourable in Indian politics. But the new movement has abolished the<span class='page-number' id='s-948' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.948]</span> Western standard and returns to national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> and principles. The first question is whether the public ought to be allowed to give a purse, the second whether the leader should accept it. To the first question the answer is that the purse takes the place of the feudal *jagir* which either secures the services of ability by placing it above want or is meant as a substantial recognition of past services. The public is entitled to adopt this form because there is no other, except such titles and honours as have been given by common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to men like Raja Subodh Chandra Mallik or the brilliant but passing honour of a public reception. But this right is limited by the obligation not to demoralise the people's servants, not to stain the purity of their motives or lower the high ideal of self-sacrifice and self-effacement which is growing up in our midst. The new servant of the people is a different type from the old political leader. He is as often as not a man who is poor, without resources, pursued by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> in his private life, yet is debarred from devoting himself to earning his private bread except by such occupations as are themselves an act of service to the people. This poverty, this indigence is the glory of the man and his great honour. Such an ideal, like that of the Brahmin, is a possession of great price which should not be lightly thrown away. If the presentation of a purse destroys it, then this form of recognition should be eschewed. But how then is the public to mark its sense of appreciation, to put something in the balance against the material injuries which the bureaucracy have it in their power to inflict just as they are able to outweigh the moral stigma of the jail or legal condemnation by marks of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and admiration? The solution lies in such rare instances as that of Sj. Bipin Chandra in the public exercising its right and leaving it to the representative of the New Spirit to deal with their gift in the new spirit. We expect the people of India to show by the substantial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the purse their high appreciation of the services of the great Nationalist leader, of his noble self-immolation and of the oppressive nature of the monstrous sentence which was inflicted on him.

We propose to go into the question from time to time and deal with the chief points which in our opinion ought to be decided in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to form a real starting-point for the fresh <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of the Congress. The first and initially essential question is the object of the Congress, the function which it proposes to discharge and the aim which it sets before itself. We agree with the Moderates that this is the first point on which a clear understanding is necessary, but we do not follow them in their contention that the decision of this question need imply the exclusion of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> who differ from the precise terms in which it is decided. The Congress is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the life of the nation and the will and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of the nation must decide the function and object of the Congress; but that will and aspiration are not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immutable</span>; they develop, change, progress, and it is always the function of the dissentient minority to stand for that potential development and progress without which life is impossible. The exclusion of the minority by a rigid shibboleth means the perpetuation in the Congress of a state of things which<span class='page-number' id='s-951' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.951]</span> may correspond for the moment to the desire of the nation, but may cease so to correspond in a few years. It means the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conversion</span> of a national assembly into a party caucus.\n\nThe function of the Congress has hitherto been to pass inoperative resolutions, its aim to influence British opinion. Needless to say, the originators were men of ability and wide views, and they had an ulterior object in instituting this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> it the shape it took. The situation in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> as they envisaged it, resembled that of the patricians and plebeians in Rome; for they accepted the permanence of British control almost as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>law of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span></span> though they were anxious to alter its conditions. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> of white patricians arrogated the control of the State in all its functions and effected an inborn social superiority accompanied not only by an intolerable arrogance and aloofness but often by actual brutality; yet it was the indigenous mass that supplied the sinews of war and did the substantial work which secured the peaceful and efficient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>. The political and social grievances were farther accentuated by the economical sufferings of the proletariat, which were largely caused by the selfish policy of the ruling caste. Yet there was no legal or constitutional means of redress, the people had no votes, no means of checking directly or indirectly either executive or legislature, no power over the purse. The only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> at their command was the vague strength of public opinion. The object of the Indian leaders, like that of the Roman plebeians, was to give a definite form to that public opinion,â€”focus it, as it is commonly expressed,â€”and, secondly, to make that definitely formulated opinion effective. In each case a new body was formed within the State which served the purpose of formulating popular sentiment with a view to bring pressure on the ruling caste and bring about a change in political conditions. But while the Roman comitia became a new sovereign assembly in the State, existing side by side with the already recognised <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>, invested with full legislative powers, governing by means of plebiscites or resolutions of the people and appointing magistrates of its own who were empowered to exercise a check on every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> legislative, executive or fiscal of the Government, the Congress<span class='page-number' id='s-952' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.952]</span> has remained from beginning to end a nullity. The difference lay partly in the conditions, partly in the means employed.\n\nThe originators of the Congress had undoubtedly before them an object very similar to that of their Roman prototypes. The Congress has sometimes been described as His Majesty's permanent Opposition; but the aim of the originators was to make it something less futile than a mere meeting of powerless critics; they certainly hoped that the plebiscites or resolutions of the Congress would eventually come to have a sovereign force and translate themselves almost automatically into laws. But they took no sufficient notice of the immense difference in the conditions of a struggle for popular rights which is introduced by the foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> of the ruling caste. There can always be an accommodation between the contending factions or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> within the same <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span>, even though the accommodation may not come till after a severe and even violent struggle, but when the ruling caste is a caste of foreigners, it is unlikely to give up its powers on any lesser compulsion than the alternative of extinction and will often prefer extinction to surrender. Even when the Congress leaders discovered that the bureaucracy was implacable and irreconcilable, they did not lay their hands on the right source of strength. The bureaucracy in India is in itself weak and powerless; it subsists greatly by the acquiescence and support of the people, partly by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> behind it of the strength of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span>. The Congress leaders saw only the second source of its strength and sought to cut it off by depriving the bureaucracy of the moral support of the British public. Their initial miscalculation pursued them. They forgot that the British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> to which they appealed was foreign justice, the justice of alien to alien, of self-satisfied and arrogant masters to discontented dependents with whom they have no bonds of blood, culture, religion or social life. Justice might be on their side, but nature and self-interest were against them. Therefore they failed.\n\nThe real strength of their position lay in the other source of bureaucratic security, the acquiescence and support of the people. As at Rome, so in India the ruling caste cannot last for a<span class='page-number' id='s-953' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.953]</span> moment except by this aid and acquiescence of the plebeian mass and when the plebeian leaders found their rulers deaf to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> and loudly-expressed feelings of the oppressed populace, they discovered an infallible weapon, a Brahmastra of peaceful political struggle, the weapon of secession. They gave the patricians notice that they would cease to give their aid and acquiescence to the patrician rule and would form a new city over against Rome. In India, by force of a similar situation, we rediscovered this weapon of secession. For boycott is nothing but this secession; we threaten to secede industrially, educationally, politically, to refuse our aid and acquiescence to the maintenance of British exploitation and British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> and British administration in India, and build ourselves a new city, a State within the State by creating our own industries, our own schools and colleges, our own instruments of justice and protection, our own network of public, executive and administrative bodies throughout the realm. Only while it was enough for the Romans to threaten, we have to carry out our threat before the weapon can be effective, because our ruling caste, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> foreign, will certainly refuse to recognise the Congress as a sovereign body whether existing side by side with the present organs of government or replacing them until it has such a position as an actual fact; they will recognise only the realised aspiration, not the distant possibility. The party of peaceful secession of thoroughgoing passive resistance does not forget that besides the support and acquiescence of the people the bureaucracy have another source of strength in the military force of the British Empire. They are often accused of forgetting it, but they realise it fully, only they also realise that this weapon of secession, of boycott and self-help, is the only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> which yet remained of a peaceful solution of the problem,â€”and they are willing to make full use of that chance.\n\nThe question of the function of the Congress hinges upon this acceptance or rejection of this weapon. Whatever be the aim of the Congress, whether it be Swaraj or Colonial self-government or administrative reform, it cannot be brought about by inoperative resolutions, it can only be brought about<span class='page-number' id='s-954' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.954]</span> by pressure; and the only means of pressure in our hands is the threat or the practice of boycott or secession. If the function of the Congress is merely to focus public opinion, it need do nothing but pass resolutions and a few slight changes of procedure will be sufficient.

Protection is vested in a corrupt and oppressive police of which the ruler of a great Province does not feel ashamed to be greeted as the friend and protector. Protection takes the form of making Afridi raids an excuse for military practice on the frontier and then quietly allowing the raids to continue.

Only the power and the strength remain and that will disappear when the people are compelled to feel their own strength. The strength of God in the people has slumbered because they \"thought that the great Sirkar was awake\", but they find, like the old Punjabi, that the Sirkar is asleep and it is time for them to awake.

If its function is merely to focus public opinion, its aim can only be to submit grievances to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> for redress, to beg for privileges and to petition for favours. It will then admit the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> authority of the bureaucracy and fulfil the purpose of collective petitioning instead of leaving each <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> class or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> to approach the omnipotent seat of power by itself. The absolute rule of the Moguls admitted this right of petition; it recognized no status in the applicant; it offered no promise of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, but decided according to the will of the sovereign. The position of the Congress in that case is no better than that of the suitor at the justice seat of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Akbar</span> or Aurangzeb. To ask without strength, to aspire without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span>, to submit if refused by the sovereign power, will be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>limit</span> of its duties. The negation of national life which this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> implies, is too reactionary to have a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of acceptance. If the few who cling to these mediaeval notions desire to keep the Congress to a role so beggarly, they must, when they enter the Congress Pandal, leave the nation outside. For a time by raising party cries and confusing issues they may get the bulk of the Moderate party to follow them, but the moment they show their hand there will be a second split and they will be left alone with a handful of well-to-do men on the Congress platform.<span class='page-number' id='s-958' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.958]</span>\n\nThe function of the Congress must obviously be to gather the life of the nation together for the purpose of national self-assertion. The question which divides us is as to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> and extent of that self-assertion. Whether we are to carry the self-assertion to its logical conclusion or to stop halfway, whether we are to separate ourselves from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>association</span> with the Government or combine association with opposition, whether we are to use boycott as a local protest against a local grievance or a grand universal means of establishing a State within the State, these are the points at issue between the Moderate party and the Nationalists. The Nationalists desire Swaraj, the Moderates desire Colonial self-government. The Nationalists wish to exclude <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> petitionary resolutions, all, that is to say, which depend on the will of the bureaucracy for their execution and not on our own exertions; they would keep the deliberative side of the Congress for ascertaining the sense of the nation as to the work which should be done and the principles which should govern it, and would add a working or executive side to review the work already done, settle the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> programme and supervise its execution. The Moderates wish to keep the petitionary side of the Congress as its chief function, but to admit a certain amount of self-help as a subordinate feature. Finally the Nationalists proclaim the boycott as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> of secession by which the nation can gradually withdraw itself from association with a control in which it has no voice or share and assert its own and separate life; the Moderates will not have a boycott *movement* at any price and are prepared only to admit a commercial boycott as temporary local <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> to bring about the redress of local grievances. The minor questions which divide the parties have no importance by themselves and would not give any trouble if there were not acute feeling engendered by these important differences of opinion or principle.\n\nThe importance of these differences cannot be denied and ought not to be belittled. We cannot agree with those who try to smooth over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> by saying that they do not exist or that there are no parties. This evasion of great political issues, this attempt to slink away from disagreeable facts and shirk the<span class='page-number' id='s-959' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.959]</span> inevitable is likely to discourage the growth of a robust political sense in the people. Peoples with a sound political instinct always take care to recognise and give their proper importance to great issues; they welcome keen discussion and even contention and eager struggle over them, but they do not allow these differences to override the sense of national unity or the struggle of parties to degenerate into a war of factions. This is the only sound way to deal with the difficulty, not by the principle of exclusion, not by breaking apart into sectional bodies and destroying the chance of a regular progression towards a single coherent and self-conscious political life, but by the principle of inclusion, by admitting differences of opinion, regulating procedure and accepting the result. The Nationalists are not in favour of Colonial self-government as an ultimate ideal, but they accepted the resolution on self-government as an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of the immediate aim of the Congress at Calcutta, because they knew that the bulk of the nation was not yet prepared to accept Swaraj as an immediate purpose. They are in favour of boycott as an universal movement throughout <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, but they accepted its restriction to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> because other provinces were not yet ready to declare in favour of boycott. They are always ready in principle to accept the decision of the Congress for the time <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span>, reserving the right to get that decision altered in the future. The severity of the struggle at Surat was due to the attempt to use a local majority in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to effect a revolution in the Congress constitution, which would turn it into a Moderate Congress and exclude the Nationalist element altogether. They took strong exception to any use of this local majority for altering the mutual composition arrived at by common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> at Calcutta, and decided to record their protest by opposing on all contested points beginning from the election of the President, but they had no intention of seceding even if the Calcutta resolutions were dropped or modified; they would simply have strained every nerve to get the wrong redressed at the next session. This attitude which was clear from the speech and action of the Nationalist leaders throughout, has been obscured by the cry raised against them of wrecking the Congress and the falsehoods which not only<span class='page-number' id='s-960' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.960]</span> attributed the whole blame of the second day's disturbance to them but represented it as preconceived by them and deliberately planned. The Nationalist party recognises only <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> sufficient ground for secession, a resolution, constitution or procedure expressly or practically excluding them from the pale of the Congress. Temporary withdrawal as a protest, not against the nature of the resolutions passed but against unconstitutional procedure, stands on a different footing and has been often practised, by the Punjab, for instance, when it abstained for several years from the Congress because of the arbitrary refusal to allow the question of the constitution to be dealt with or properly raised.\n\nThis we hold to be the only possible attitude if an organised political unity is to be achieved. Full right of discussion, free use of every legitimate means of protest, but not secession on account of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span>. The Moderate party outside Bengal is, at present, keen for separation. It holds the view, loudly preached by the Bombay papers, that if certain resolutions are passed, if a certain colour is given to the proceedings of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> or to agitation carried on by any section of its members in the country, they are not only entitled but bound to withdraw if they are in the minority or to expel the Nationalists if they are in the majority. They seem to base this view on two grounds, first, that they cannot allow opinions not their own to be expressed in Congress resolutions, secondly, that such opinions or political association with those who hold them, will discredit Congress in the eyes of the Government. The first presupposes either a claim to hold the Congress as their personal property or an intolerance which is inconsistent with the essential conditions of a self-governing body; the second, either a dependence on bureaucratic in place of public opinion which is also incompatible with the spirit of self-government or an implied right of control by bureaucratic influence which no patriot will admit. We assert the right of the Congress to determine its own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span>, functions, aspirations, constitution; we do not admit the right of any party sitting in convention to determine them for the Congress. If the Moderates desire to have the creed of the Congress fixed, they must get it<span class='page-number' id='s-961' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.961]</span> done by the Congress, which is alone competent to decide the question, and must not couple it with a proviso of exclusion against those who cannot subscribe to every article of the creed. The ideal of the Congress may be complete self-government or it may be partial, its methods may be petitionary or they may be self-assertive. That is a question not of constitution but of the balance of opinion. The only constitutional question to be decided in connection with the determination of the aim or ideal is whether those who pitch their ideal either higher or lower than the precise key settled at a particular session are to be excluded in future or admitted, whether the Congress is to be a stationary and sectional body or comprehensiveness is to be aimed at and progress and movement to be allowed.<span class='page-number' id='s-962' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.962]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/exclusion-or-unity","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"How the Riot Was Made","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/how-the-riot-was-made","prvt":"Anti-Swadeshi in Madras","prvu":"/cwsa/07/anti-swadeshi-in-madras","dt":"1908-03-24","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["how-the-riot-was-made"],"t":"How the Riot Was Made","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The statement of the Public Prosecutor that the cause of the Tinnevelly riots was that Mr. Chidambaram Pillai was remanded to custody and that Mr. Pillai had himself quelled a disturbance which was likely to take place at Tuticorin station, is only additional and independent evidence to support a self-evident <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>.

This divergence has been chiefly operative in bringing about struggles over the election of the President and his method of conducting the proceedings, over the selection of the Subjects Committee and the rights of the delegates to express their opinion and use every means to make it operative. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span> side demands implicit <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> to the authority of the President and a small circle of leaders, the other claims that the President is only a servant of the Congress with a delegated and limited power, that the Congress is supreme and no small circle of leaders has a right to dictate to it, and that the obscurest delegate is by his very position equal in rights and status to the most distinguished men in the country. One side tries to form a Subjects Committee of the leading men in each province, the other tries to enforce the right of the delegates to make their own unhampered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span>.

When therefore the Congress was instituted, the originators tried to cast it in the democratic mould, to clothe it in democratic forms. But the idea by itself cannot become operative, it must first create a corresponding need. The Congress, therefore, while democratic in theory, was in reality a close <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oligarchy</span> of the most primitive type. Claiming to realise in obedience to the most developed modern ideas the course of modern democratic development, it really followed in obedience to the actual political conditions of the country a course of primitive development very like in its essential features to the primitive constitutions of early times when democracy was unconsciously evolving. There was no electorate which could make the principle of election operative, no political vitality or habit of political thought in the people to put <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> into the forms of a democratic assembly, no battle of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> which could hammer out the complete mould of a great deliberative assembly from the rough and shapeless mass called the Congress.\n\nNominally, the Congress was a sort of imitation Parliament and its delegates were supposed to be elected by the people and representatives of the people; in reality, there was no electorate to represent and the forms of election degenerated into a farce; five people often meeting to elect a hundred out of whom those only attended the Congress session who had time and leisure. In effect, therefore, the Congress was not a modern Parliament but a popular assembly like the old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aryan</span> assemblies in which the whole body of the citizens could attend and all did attend who had the inclination and the leisure. But while the old Aryan assembly was actually the mustering of the citizens, the Congress was rather like those early federal assemblies held in a central place in which as many as could attended from distant places and the bulk of the gathering was made up of local citizens. The peculiarity of the Congress has been the failure to provide against the preponderance of the local majority except by the habit of aiming at unanimity in its resolutions. This flaw in the<span class='page-number' id='s-965' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.965]</span> foundation has been largely responsible for the final tumbling to pieces of the structure. Nominally again, the resolutions of the Congress were passed by the vote of the assembled delegates, as in a democratic chamber; in reality, the delegates did not vote at all but, like the primitive assemblies, simply accepted by acclamation resolutions ready-prepared for them by a few influential men sitting in secret council. Nominally the President was elected by the Congress and presided over the proceedings according to recognised rules of debate, but in reality he was chosen out of and by the small oligarchical circle which ruled the Congress, effected their decisions and carried out their will. His authority over the proceedings was unfettered by any written rules; the custom and the precedents of the assembly were the sole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> and these were interpreted by him according to the convenience of the Congress oligarchs. Thus the pretence of a modern democratic assembly reduced itself in practice to the reality of an oligarchy. A small circle meeting in secret called the Congress, decided its place of meeting, fixed its policy, framed its resolutions, selected its officers, governed its proceedings and took the opinion of the assembly by acclamation. The assembly listened to the speakers selected by the oligarchs and passed by acclamation the resolutions they had framed. The President was simply a temporary chief of the oligarchs and not the real head of a democratic assembly. In all these respects the Congress reproduced with extraordinary fidelity the essential features of a primitive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span> ecclesia or the Roman comitia in the most oligarchical period.\n\nThe first attempt to democratise the Congress was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of the Subjects Committee, as a sort of temporary Senate or Council which should prepare the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of the Congress. It was an unconscious reproduction of the Greek *boule* or preliminary Council which had similar functions; but it failed to democratise the Congress, it only widened the basis of the Congress oligarchy. It was supposed to be elected by the assembly but was really selected by the oligarchs whose nominations were accepted by the Congress. The Subjects Committee meetings were indeed the scene of frequent encounters<span class='page-number' id='s-966' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.966]</span> between the oligarchs and the free-lances who represented a growing strain of popular discontent; but there was no popular party which these men could set against the prestige of the old leaders, and they themselves were usually young and ambitious men who soon passed into the charmed circle and became its chief supports. Those of a robuster type, a Tilak or a Bipin Pal, were held at arm's length and, having no organized following, were unable to prevail.\n\nAnother direction in which the incipient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democratic tendency</span> sought to fulfil itself was in the demand for a fixed and written constitution for the Congress. Unwritten law administered by a coterie, class or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span>, has always been a strength to oligarchy, and we find in early times that the first demand of infant democracy is for the codification of law and a fixed and written constitution. We have ourselves experienced in the last two years what a powerful weapon in the hands of the Congress oligarchy has been this absence of a written constitution, law and procedure for the Congress. The demand for a written constitution early manifested itself and led for some time to an actual secession of a whole Province from the Congress, but the privilege of administering the body without fixed or written restrictions was too highly valued by the official clique to be lightly parted with, and by procrastination and masterly inaction they succeeded in baffling the growing demand.\n\nTo democratise the Congress was in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> impossible without a popular awakening and widening of the political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span>. Democracy is impossible without a demos, a people politically awake and active, and it was only in the upheaval of 1905 that the rudiments of such a demos began to form. The Nationalist party which sprang out of that upheaval, showed its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> by the democratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of its demands and the increasing tendency to democracy in its own composition. It demanded that the President should be elected according to popular sentiment and not by a coterie, that the Subjects Committee should be elected in due form and not nominated by a coterie, that the President and the Congress official circles should act constitutionally and not at their caprice or convenience, that the<span class='page-number' id='s-967' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.967]</span> constitution should be reduced to writing, that the full assembly of delegates should be in fact as well as in theory the sovereign body and that the rights of discussion, amendment and rejection of resolutions should be allowed to be put in practice. In brief, they claimed that the theoretically democratic Congress should become democratic in effect and reality. The keenness of the struggle not only in the Congress but outside it, has been largely if not principally due to this onslaught on the charmed oligarchical circle and the determination of the latter to preserve their position at any cost. At Midnapore for instance the struggle was over this issue, and not over any serious difference of opinion. And though the issue at Surat was much larger and complicated, it is significant that the battle was joined over a question of constitutional procedure, and it was on a claim of the official oligarchy to override the constitutional rights of a delegate that the Surat Congress broke up in admired disorder. Oligarchy or democracy, authority or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> are the issue, and no settlement can work which does not decide the question whether the Congress is to remain a mute assembly swayed by a handful of men or a democratic body of as modern a development as the political conditions of the country will allow.<span class='page-number' id='s-968' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.968]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/oligarchy-or-democracy","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Freedom of Speech","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/freedom-of-speech","prvt":"How the Riot Was Made","prvu":"/cwsa/07/how-the-riot-was-made","dt":"1908-03-25","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["freedom-of-speech"],"t":"Freedom of Speech","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The questions in Parliament about the change of the existing law and Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s answers seem to point to a coming repressive measure intended to suppress the small amount of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>free speech</span> still existing in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>.

They persist in the survivors of the old generation and in those of the present generation who cannot open themselves to new ideas, but are dead in the minds of those who will be the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> people of India. In the course of another fifty years men will look back to the times when such ideas were possible in the same spirit that the nineteenth century looked back to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Middle Ages</span>, as a period of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> and darkness when the national mind and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consciousness</span> were in a state of total eclipse. The blessings of British rule have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The Pax Britannica is now seen to be the cause of our loss of manliness and power of self-defence, a peace of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> and torpor, security to starve in, the ease of the grave. British law has been found to be a fruitful source of demoralisation, an engine to destroy ancient houses, beggar wealthy families and drain the poor of their little competence. British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> has denationalised the educated <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, laid waste the fertile<span class='page-number' id='s-969' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.969]</span> soil of the Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, suppressed originality and invention, created a gulf between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> and the masses and done its best to kill that spirituality which is the soul of India. The petty privileges which British statecraft has thrown to us as morsels from the rich repast of liberty, have pauperised us politically, preserved all that was low, weak and dependent in our political temperament and discouraged the old robust manhood of our forefathers. Every Municipal or District Board has been a nursery of dependence and pampered slavery, and the right of public meeting and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of the Press only served to complete this demoralisation, while at the same time cheating us into the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> that we were free.\n\nThe ancient Romans had a class of slaves born in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span> and pampered in their childhood by their masters who were called *vernae* and enjoyed a peculiar position of mingled licence and subjection. They were allowed to speak with the most unbounded licence, to abuse their masters, to play tricks sometimes of a most injurious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and were yet indulgedâ€”so long as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> was in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humour</span>; let the master's temper turn sour or break into passion and the lash was called into requisition. The freedom of speech enjoyed by us under the bureaucratic rule has been precisely of this kind. It depended on the will of a despotic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>, and at any moment it could be withdrawn or abridged, at any moment the lash of the law could be brought down on the back of the critic. This freedom of speech was worse than the Russian censorship; for in Russia the editor laboured under no delusion, he knew that freedom of speech was not his, and if he wrote against the administration, it was at his own risk; there was no pretence, no dissimulation on either side. But our freedom of speech has demoralised us, fostered an ignoble mixture of servility and licence, of cringing and impudence, which are the very temperament of the slave. We were extravagantly pleased with the slightest boons conceded to us and poured out our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> with fulsome <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>gratitude</span>, or we grew furious at favours withheld and abused the withholders in the same key. Our public expressions were full of evasions, falsehoods, flatteries of British rule coupled with venomous and<span class='page-number' id='s-970' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.970]</span> damaging attacks on that which in the same breath we lauded to the skies. A habit of cowardly insincerity became ingrained in us, which was fatal to the soundness of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, an insincerity which refused to be confined to our relations with the rulers and pursued us into our relations with our own countrymen. The same dry rot of insincerity vitiated all our public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> and even our private lives, making a farce of our politics, a comedy of our social reform, and turning us from men into masks. The strenuous attempt to live what we believed, which was the result of the ancient Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>discipline</span>, left the educated class altogether and a gulf was placed between our practice and our professions, so that the heart of India began to beat slower and slower and seemed likely to stop.\n\nIt was the proud privilege of the Nationalist party to strike at the root of this terrible <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>. From the first outburst of the Swadeshi <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, their speakers and writers decided to be no longer masks but men, to speak and write the truth that was in their minds, the feeling that was in their hearts without disguise, without equivocation, as free men vindicating their freedom,â€”a freedom not bestowed but inborn. The poison passed out of the national system and the blood began to circulate freely in our veins. Once more we stood up as men and not as gibbering spectres of a vanished <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the *Sandhya* and *Yugantar*, consistently maintained in the dock, stood for a revival of Indian sincerity, truthfulness, manliness, fearlessness; it was the resurgence of the Arya, the ideal of honour and quiet manhood which made our forefathers great. But when the prosecutions failed to crush the papers for which the martyrs offered themselves as a sacrifice, the cry was raised that they were <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> sacrificed by designing men who kept themselves in the background. The persistence of the same tone and the same writings showed that those who maintained the spirit of the paper were untouched, and it was obvious that only by putting them under lock and key, could the journal itself be snuffed out. So the threat of a change in the law which would hunt out the real culprits, has been persistently held before our eyes, and, if disregarded, may be carried out. The threat is an empty one,<span class='page-number' id='s-971' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.971]</span> because no change of law can find out those whom the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> is determined to save, lest the light of truth be prematurely put under eclipse. Only by the abrogation of all law, by an arbitrary measure extinguishing the freedom of speech altogether can these journals be snuffed out of being by the hand of Power. Such a measure may at any moment be hurried through the Legislative Council, and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of it troubles our Moderate friends and sometimes finds <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> in objurgations against our past indiscretions or our policy of protecting our writers and contributors coupled with more or less bland invitations to commit suicide so that their journals may survive.

If the work is to be well done, each man must recognize his proper work and do it. The clash of conflicting egoisms, the desire to monopolise, the pride of success must disappear from our midst and be replaced by our intense self-effacement, an enthusiasm of sacrifice, an exalted conception of the high Power at work and the constant sense that we are only His instruments. It is for this reason that we have recently laid stress on this great truth; no advance can be made, no mighty success obtained unless we are able to perceive the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span> of the movement, realise the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of subordinating ourselves, overcome the tendency to break into cliques and cabals and apportion to each his allotted portion in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> united work.

This scepticism reached its culmination in the teachings of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddha</span>, who would admit nothing, presuppose nothing, declare nothing dogmatically, and insisted only on self-discipline, self-communion, self-realisation as the only way to escape from the entanglement of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> and the senses.

Nowhere has it succeeded in realising the ultimate secret of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>. Nowhere has it found satisfaction.

The East alone has some <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the truth, the East alone can teach the West, the East alone can save mankind. Through all these ages <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span> has been seeking for a light within, and whenever she has been blessed with a glimpse of what she seeks a great religion has been born, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddhism</span>, Confucianism, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedanism</span> with all their countless sects. But the grand workshop of spiritual experiment, the laboratory of the soul has been India, where thousands of great spirits have been born in every generation who were content to work quietly in their own souls, perfect their knowledge, hand down the results of their experiments to a few disciples and leave the rest to others to complete. They did not hasten to proselytise, were in no way eager to proclaim themselves, but merely added their quota of experience and returned to the source from which they had come. The immense reservoir of spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> stored up by the self-repression was the condition of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of *avatars*, of men so full of God that they could not be satisfied with silent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>bliss</span>, but poured it out on the world, not with the idea<span class='page-number' id='s-978' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.978]</span> of proselytising but because they wished to communicate their own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ecstasy</span> of realisation to others who were fit to receive it either by previous *tapasya* or by the purity of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span>. Of all these souls Sri Ramakrishna was the last and greatest, for while others felt God in a single or limited aspect, he felt Him in His illimitable unity as the sum of an illimitable variety. In him the spiritual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>experiences</span> of the millions of saints who had gone before were renewed and united. Sri Ramakrishna gave to India the final message of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Hinduism</span> to the world. A new era dates from his birth, an era in which the peoples of the earth will be lifted for a while into communion with God and spirituality become the dominant note of human life. What Christianity failed to do, what Mahomedanism strove to accomplish in times as yet unripe, what Buddhism half-accomplished for a brief period and among a limited number of men, Hinduism as summed up in the life of Sri Ramakrishna has to attempt for all the world. This is the reason of India's resurgence, this is why God has breathed life into her once more, why great souls are at work to bring about her salvation, why a sudden change is coming over the hearts of her sons.

Swadeshi is now the dream and hope of all India. Loyalist, Moderate, Nationalist, all are at one on this point, all are agreed, that without Swadeshi there is no hope for the people of India. When it becomes evident that the bureaucracy is bent on destroying the only means by which Swadeshi can be secure of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, the greatest supporter of the present <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> will feel that his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> lies between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>loyalty</span> to his country and the hope of her resurgence on the one hand and loyalty to the bureaucracy and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destruction</span> of his people and his motherland on the other.\n\nWhen Srijut Chidambaram Pillai set himself to the task of<span class='page-number' id='s-981' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.981]</span> establishing a Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company between Tuticorin and Colombo, he was taking a step which meant the beginning of the end for the British commercial monopoly in India. There are three departments of Swadeshi which have to be developed in order to make India commercially independent, first, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of manufactures, secondly, the retail supply, thirdly, the security of carriage from the place of manufacture to the place of supply. Of all these the third is the most essential, because the others are bound to lead a precarious existence if all the means of carriage are in the hands of the enemies of Swadeshi. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> experienced in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> by those who tried to import Swadeshi goods from Calcutta in the face of the control of the railway and the steam services by hostile interests, are only a slight foretaste of the paralysing obstacles which will be thrown in our way the moment it is seen that Swadeshi has got the upper hand. The only remedy for this state of things is for the people of the country to organize steamer services both by sea and by river, so that all carriage by water at least may be in their hands. The carriage by land cannot come into our hands without a political revolution, but if we hold the waterways, we shall not only hold an important part of the system of communications but be able to use our possession of it as a weapon against British trade if the railway is utilized against us. The instinct of the country had seized on this truth and the organization of Swadeshi steam services has been one of the first and most successful outcomes of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. The Chittagong Company and Tuticorin Company have both been a phenomenal success and, owing to the spirit of self-sacrificing patriotism which has awakened in the hearts of the people, they have been able to beat their British rivals without entering into a war of rates, for the British steamers charging extravagantly low rates have been unable to command as much custom as the dearer Swadeshi services. A network of Companies holding the water carriage from Rangoon to Karachi and the Persian Gulf would soon have come into existence and the waterways of East Bengal would have been covered with boats plying from town to town in the ownership of Swadeshi concerns. If the Swadeshi<span class='page-number' id='s-982' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.982]</span> Steam Navigation Company is crushed, this fair prospect will be ruined and all hope of commercial independence disappear for ever. The bureaucracy well know the tremendous importance of the issue at stake and have sacrificed everything, honour, justice, decency, to the one all-important <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of success. We also must awaken to the necessity of saving Swadeshi in this hour of danger. The time is a critical one and it is as if Providence had determined to test the spirit of the people and see whether it was strong enough to deserve assistance. The Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company was on the point of crushing its British rival, if the bureaucracy had not interfered; it is now on the point of being crushed itself unless the people interfere. The people have the power to save it by blotting out its rival. If the merchants refuse in a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> to ship by the alien service, if the people refuse to tread its decks no amount of bureaucratic help, no amount of magisterial injustice and police tyranny can save it from the doom it deserves. We look to the Nationalists of Madras to see that this is done.

We are able to state the real facts.

We have been accustomed to deal only with the economical side of this poverty, but there is a moral side which is even more important. The Indian peasantry have always been distinguished from the less civilized masses of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> by their superior piety, gentleness, sobriety, purity, thrift and native <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intelligence</span>.

This degeneration is proceeding with an alarming rapidity. In some parts of the country it has gone so far that recovery seems impossible. We have heard of districts in which the peasantry are so far reduced to poverty by the exactions of Zamindars, planters and police that the sturdier classes among them are taking to highway robbery and dacoity as the only possible means of livelihood. We have heard of villages where the liquor shop and the prostitute, institutions unknown twenty-five years ago, have now the mastery of the<span class='page-number' id='s-985' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.985]</span> poorest villagers. Many of the villages in West <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> are now well supplied with these essentials of Western civilization. The people ground down between the upper millstone of the indigo planter and the nether millstone of the Zamindar, are growing full of despair and look to violence as their only remedy.

Their duty is to be worthy of their mission, to bring hope, strength and light into the lives of their downtrodden countrymen. We have so far been occupied with Swadeshi as the economical means of saving the people: we must now set ourselves to the restoration of the moral tone of the nation by ourselves setting an example of mercy, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, self-denial, helpfulness and patient work for the people. The work is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> for the young. It was they who made the Swadeshi movement a success and ensured its permanence; they also must set themselves to the task which now calls us and go to the succour of their suffering countrymen, point their spirits to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> which is to come, support them in their present sufferings, relieve them so far as possible and bind the educated class and the masses together by the golden bond of love and service. This is the next step in the development of the present movement. Swadeshi is fairly begun and will now go on of its own impetus; but when the work of which we speak is taken in hand, Swadeshi will receive a fresh impetus which will make it so irresistible that all the tyranny of the officials, all the police oppression, every obstacle and hindrance which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> can interpose will be swept away like so much chaff, and all Bengal become the fortress of<span class='page-number' id='s-986' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.986]</span> Swadeshi, its temple and its domain.

The truth was not one which his hearers could grasp; many must have gone away scoffing, few could have appreciated the luminous penetration of insight which lay behind the thought of the speaker. The awakening of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Asia</span> is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span> of the twentieth century, and in that awakening the lead has been given to the Mongolian races of the Far <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span>. In the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span>, the patriotic spirit, the quick imitative faculty of Japan; in the grand deliberation, the patient thoroughness, the irresistible organization of China, Providence found the necessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> which would meet the European with his own weapons and outdo him in that science, strength and ability which are his peculiar pride. The political instinct of the European races has enabled them to understand the purpose of the Almighty in the awakening of the Mongol. A terror is in their hearts, a palsy has come upon their strength, and with blanched lips they watch every movement of the two Eastern giants, each wondering when his turn will come to feel the sword of the Mikado or what will happen when China, the Titan of the world, shall have completed her quiet, steady, imperturbable preparation. The vision of a China organized, equipped, full of the clang of war and the tramp of armed men, preparing to surge forth westwards is the nightmare of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dreams</span>. And another terror of economic invasion, of the Mongol swamping Europe with cheap <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> and stifling the industries of Europe adds a fresh poignancy to the apprehensions which convulse the West. Hence the panic in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>America</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Australia</span>, in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Africa</span>, the savage haste to expel the Asiatic at any cost before the military strength of China is sufficiently developed to demand entrance for her subjects with the sword emphasizing her demand. This is the Yellow Peril, and every European knows in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of hearts that it is<span class='page-number' id='s-989' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.989]</span> only a question of the time necessary for his vision to translate itself into the waking world. But one thing the European has not yet perceived and that is that the Mongolian is no wild adventurer to go filibustering to Australia or bombard with his siege-guns San Francisco or New York before Asia is free. The first blow given by the Mongolian fell upon Russia because she stood across the Asiatic continent barring the westward surge of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. The second blow will fall on England because she holds India.\n\nThe position of India makes her the key of Asia. She divides the Pagan Far East from the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> West, and is their meeting-place. From her alone can proceed a force of union, a starting-point of comprehension, a reconciliation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedanism</span> and Paganism. Her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> is necessary to the unity of Asia. Geographically, she occupies an impregnable position of strength commanding the East of Asia as well as the West, from which as from a secure fortress she can strike the nations of the Persian or the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chinese</span> world. Such a position held by an European Power means a perpetual menace to the safety of Asia. It will therefore be the first great enterprise of a Chino-Japanese alliance to eject the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> from India, and hold her in the interests of Asiatic freedom and Asiatic unity. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of India's position is one which neither the English nor the Mongolian can escape. No treaties, no attempts to reconcile conflicting interests will stand against the secret and inexorable necessity which forces nations to follow not the dictates of prudence or diplomacy, but the fiat of their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span>. When the inevitable happens and the Chinese armies knock at the Himalayan gates of India and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japanese</span> fleets appear before Bombay harbour, by what strength will England oppose this gigantic combination? Her armies which took two years to overcome the opposition of forty thousand untrained farmers in the Transvaal? Her fleets which have never fought a battle with a trained foe since Trafalgar? They will be broken to pieces by the science and skill of the Mongolian. And the key of Asia will pass into Mongolian hands and the strength of India, the Sikh and the Rajput and the Mahratta, the force of Mahomedan valour and the rising <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span><span class='page-number' id='s-990' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.990]</span> of new nations in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> and Madras will all be at the service and under the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guidance</span> of the Mongolian who will not fail to use them as England has failed, letting them run to waste, but will hammer them into a sword of strength for the fulfilment of his mission, the extrusion of the European from Asia, Africa, Australia, the smiting down of European pride, the humiliation of Western statecraft, power and civilisation and its subordination to the lead of the dominant Asiatic.\n\nThe doom is drawing very near and the awakening of Bengal has come just in time to give India a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of recovering her freedom of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>. If she strains every nerve to use the chance, if she is able to develop her self-consciousness, her unity, her warlike <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, her industrial independence, she will be in a position to assert her own will, to offer herself as an ally and not an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, it may be even, as Bipin Babu suggested, to mediate between the civilisation of Europe and Asia, both of them so necessary to human development. Two great obstacles stand in her way. The blindness of the bureaucracy which is straining every nerve to crush the Indian renascence in the vain hope that it can continue to rule, is the least of the two. Far more formidable is the greater though more excusable blindness of the people themselves who still persist in connecting their future with the rule of England. Our Moderate politicians refuse to allow their minds to shake off the delusion that the British rule is a dispensation of Providence and meant to endure. All their thoughts of the future assume that the present is perpetual, that what is, will be. As one long in darkness cannot see the light when it enters suddenly his prison, so our people even when the dawn has come, cannot believe that it is really daybreak. They persist in assuming that the night will continue and are content with merely turning a little in bed instead of rising and swiftly accoutring themselves for the work of the day. The warning which Srijut Bipin Chandra addressed to the British people, is also a warning to the people of India. British rule can only continue in India, if India is willing that it should continue and strong enough to defend it against all comers. If a rejuvenated India decides to be free, it depends on the present action of the<span class='page-number' id='s-991' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.991]</span> bureaucracy whether free India will be a friend of England and a mediator between Europe and the triumphant Mongol or an ally of the latter in the approaching Armageddon. Even if the movement in India is crushed, it will not be England that will reap the fruit of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>crime</span> in strangling an infant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationality</span>. She will before long be swept out of India by the Mongolian broom and the latent forces which she refused to utilize will be used against her by a bolder and more skilful statesmanship. The people of India too will have to reap the fruits of their present Karma. On them far more than on the bureaucracy it depends whether they will meet the coming Mongolian as a destined slave and instrument, an ally or an equal whose voice shall override all others in determining the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of the world.<span class='page-number' id='s-992' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.992]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/india-and-the-mongolian","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Religion and the Bureaucracy","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/religion-and-the-bureaucracy","prvt":"The Next Step","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-next-step","dt":"1908-04-01","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["religion-and-the-bureaucracy"],"t":"Religion and the Bureaucracy","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The measure of the panic into which the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> has thrown the bureaucracy can be taken from its interference with the religious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of the people.

The expulsion of a religious preacher from Travancore is significant of the direction in which the fears of the bureaucracy are tending. That this act of tyranny was not the work of the Maharaja goes without saying, since no Hindu prince would dream of interfering with the religion of his subjects.

When this desirable consummation is brought about, the next step will be the formation of a Constitution under which a harmonious working may be possible. We have already formulated what in our opinion should be the principles of the Constitution; the basis should be democratic and not oligarchic, the scope of the Congress should be widened so as to embrace actual work, the aim left indeterminate. It is the function of this <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> to gather around it the strength of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>, and no creed should be promulgated which would have the result of excluding any section of the people.\n\nTaking these principles as our starting-point we shall proceed to discuss the chief questions which must be settled in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to ensure harmonious working between the two parties. The first issue which will present itself is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>choice</span> of a President. In his speech at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Federation</span> Ground, Sj. Bipin Chandra Pal threw out a suggestion which he thought might obviate the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> which now attend the choice of a President. The present method of election is wholly unsatisfactory. A Reception Committee formed on the basis of wealth, not of democratic election is the primary authority; and the choice of the President is determined by a three-fourths majority which it is under present circumstances impossible to secure. Failing this impossibility, the All-India Congress Committee proceeds to nominate a President who may be the choice not of the country but of a party, and the<span class='page-number' id='s-996' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.996]</span> nomination is confirmed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> of the Congress which the Moderates declare to be a mere formality of election not implying any right of the delegates to withhold their consent or reverse the decision of the Committee. This method of election is about the most irrational, undemocratic and perversely unconstitutional which can be imagined. The whole value of a democratic constitution lies in the relation of the parts of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commonwealth</span> to each other on the basis of a definite delegation of power by the people to its officials, magistrates or governing bodies. The present system eliminates the sovereignty of the people altogether; it sets up an irresponsible body temporarily created for a different purpose as the primary authority and creates in the All-India Committee a power of final election which makes it independent of the people.\n\nSrijut Bipin Chandra proposes to leave the election of the President to the Reception Committee, permitting the anomaly to continue for the sake of peace; but the voice of the people is not to be entirely silent. Inoperative in the election, it finds its opportunity in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>criticism</span> of the President's address which is to be open to discussion and amendment like the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>King</span>'s Speech in Parliament. This right of criticism and amendment will act as a check on the party proclivities of the President and tend to bring his speech to the colourless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of a pronouncement embracing what the whole nation is agreed upon and omitting the points of difference which still divide men's minds. It is possible that an obstinate President might face the disagreeable certainty of a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> on his address, in which case the check would not work; but this would be too unlikely a possibility to be a serious drawback to Sj. Bipin Chandra's proposal. The defect in it as a complete solution lies elsewhere. It provides against the misuse of the Presidential chair to deliver a party pronouncement wounding to the susceptibilities of a part of the audience, but it does not provide against the misuse of the Presidential authority to prevent the passing of resolutions disagreeable to the party to which the President for the year happens to belong. This can be done, however, without altering Bipin Babu's suggestion.\n\nThere are two aspects of the Presidential position. In one he<span class='page-number' id='s-997' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.997]</span> is the spokesman of the nation issuing a manifesto on its behalf with regard to the questions of the day. The Moderate party usually tries to belittle this aspect by the contention that the President's speech binds no one but himself. If that is so, then he has no right to take up a whole day of the brief time available for work with utterances and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> which are of no conceivable importance to the country or the world at large. Either the President's speech is a national manifesto and should be denuded of its party <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, or it is a personal <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of opinion and should be either eliminated altogether or reduced to the brief proportions of an acknowledgement of the honour done to him in his election, so that the Congress may at once proceed to real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span>. In that case the President will become a speaker of the House and nothing more, which he is at present, but only in his second and subordinate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>. In this secondary capacity he is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of the deliberations of the Congress and can, if he so wishes, try to rule out of court or declare as lost without division any proposal or amendment which is displeasing to his party. Indeed, as everybody knows, it is this which has been at the root of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the bitterness that has gathered round the question and which led to the fracas at Surat. It will not therefore be enough to provide against the party character of the address, it is still more necessary to provide against the party use of the President's authority. In the House of Commons the Speaker is a non-party <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> whose sole business is to interpret impartially the rules of the House, and, if we are to avoid the repetition of such scenes as took place at Surat, the President of the Congress must be compelled to assume the same character. The difficulties in the way are two: first, the absence of any well-understood rules of procedure in the Congress; secondly, the absence of a strong public opinion which would unanimously resent the misuse of his authority whatever party might be benefited. If the now unwritten procedure of the Congress is reduced to writing and provision made for the right of delegates to lay their views in due form before the Congress, the first difficulty may be got rid of, and a very necessary step taken in the democratisation of the Congress. But the interpretation of the rules is always liable to<span class='page-number' id='s-998' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.998]</span> misuse, as all free countries have found, and the only safeguard against it is a strong sense of the supreme importance of free discussion which will override party feeling and discourage the temptation to acquiesce in anything which will bring about a party victory. To develop such a feeling will take time. In the meanwhile such checks should be devised as would both deter the President from misusing his authority and foster the growth of a public sentiment such as governs the proceedings of free assemblies in free countries. Mr. Tilak at the Surat Congress appealed to the Congress against the decision of the Chairman of the Reception Committee disallowing his notice for the adjournment of the election of the President. This right which is inherent in every free assembly, ought to be specifically recognized. We cannot find a better means of checking any tendency to abuse authority than the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> that an appeal lies against one's decision to the whole assembly of the delegates, nor any stronger incentive to the growth of the public sentiment we desire to create than the knowledge that the final responsibility for dishonest party tactics will rest on the whole body of the delegates. If these precautions are added to the suggestion of Srijut Bipin Chandra the difficulties at present arising out of the anomalous election of the President will largely disappear. At the same time, the anomaly remains and if we overlook it for the present for the sake of peace, it should be clearly recognised that the present system can only be a temporary device pending the growth of a definite electorate in the country which can take over the function of electing the President.\n\nThe suggestions we put forward therefore are that the President should be elected by a bare majority of the Reception Committee or, failing a clear majority in favour of one name over all others combined, by the All-India Congress Committee; that the President take his seat the moment the Congress sits, before the Chairman of the Reception Committee begins his address of welcome; that the address of the President after delivery be open to formal discussion, in other words, that the Congress be asked to accept the address and that the right of amendment be permitted; that the President be governed by definite rules of<span class='page-number' id='s-999' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.999]</span> procedure, and that his decision be subject to an appeal to the whole House.<span class='page-number' id='s-1000' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1000]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-question-of-the-president","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Utility of Ideals","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-utility-of-ideals","prvt":"Swadeshi Cases and Counsel","prvu":"/cwsa/07/swadeshi-cases-and-counsel","dt":"1908-04-03","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-utility-of-ideals"],"t":"The Utility of Ideals","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We notice that a correspondent of the *Amrita Bazar Patrika*, finding himself out of his depth at the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Federation</span> Ground Meeting, rather plaintively asks Bipin Babu to come down from the heights of philosophy and talk to the people of Swadeshi, Boycott and National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>.

If Bipin Chandra were an ordinary political leader and the present time an ordinary political epoch, his complaint would have been justified.

It is as much a futile piece of reaction as Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span>'s Council of Notables. The same exclusive, oligarchical spirit of the past trying to dominate the future, of the few with wealth, position and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> for their title claiming the monopoly of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, animates the idea of the Convention. Perhaps if the Convention becomes a living <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fact</span>, it may, who knows, be accepted by Mr. Morley as the basis for his Council of Notables? But if the Moderates of Bombay would welcome such a consummation, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> leaders ought to know that the attempt to separate the Congress from the life of the people will be disastrous to the future of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> for which Bengal stands. If they associate themselves with any such attempt to bring back the country to the footstool of the bureaucracy, they will have given the last blow to their influence and popularity. They may remain Notables, they will cease to be popular leaders. The resolution of the Pabna Conference which was accepted by them leaves them no ground to stand upon if they associate themselves with the Bombay attempt to turn back the wheels of time and put an end to the natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of the Congress. The Convention was the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of Sir Pherozshah <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span> who will leave no stone unturned to save his offspring when the Convention Committee meets at Allahabad; it will be seen whether the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of Sir Pherozshah Mehta or the fear of the country is strongest in the hearts of the Moderate leaders. They are still, it seems, undecided as to their course, a dangerous condition of mind since the powerful will of Sir Pherozshah is likely to carry all before it, if it is not met by a settled determination to give effect to the plainly expressed wishes of the people.\n\nWhatever happens at the Convention the leaders of the Moderate party will be held responsible for the result. If the Congress breaks asunder for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>, the blame will rest on them and they will no longer be able to throw it upon the Nationalists who have since the break-up at Surat laid themselves open to the charge of weakness and cowardice rather than stand in the way of reconciliation. From the first meeting of the Nationalist Conference after the fracas on the second day of the session<span class='page-number' id='s-1004' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1004]</span> to the present moment the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>attitude</span> of the party has been accommodating to a fault. They allowed the Moderates to score a seeming triumph at Pabna rather than allow a second split. At Poona in their stronghold they invited the co-operation of the Moderates at Dhulia, they even consented to the question of the Boycott <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> allowed to stand over, unless otherwise decided by the Provincial Conference, rather than forfeit Moderate co-operation. The public utterances of Nationalist papers and Nationalist speakers from the speech of Mr. Tilak after the fracas to the latest speeches at the Poona Conference have all been pervaded by the thought of reconciliation, the anxiety for union. The Nationalists make no stipulation except that no creed shall be imposed on the Congress from outside, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> be taken which implies that the Convention is the arbiter of the destinies of the Congress and that no constitution or change of policy shall be drawn up by anyone as binding on the Congress before the Congress itself decided on its future course. This is an attitude to which no one can take reasonable exception. The Nationalists also appointed a Committee after the fiasco, but the instructions issued to this Committee were merely to watch the results of the split, to see that a reconciliation be effected and only in the last resort to take up the work of the Congress where it had broken off, if no accommodation proved possible. The Committee has therefore taken no action <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> watching the course of events and exercising the influence of its authorised officials to bring about such resolutions as would <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> the reconciliation of the parties. It depends entirely on the result of the meeting at Allahabad whether the Committee is to assert its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> or quietly allow itself to cease when the main object for which it came into being has been accomplished.

Now the Anglo-Indian Defence Association hails largely from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> the Tweed.\n\n---\n\nThe first speaker who took the affairs of the Empire under his patronage, was a certain Mr. Lockhart Smith. He gave some firm but kindly advice to the leaders of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian thought</span> as to the best way of managing their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> forgetting that his time would have been more usefully employed in minding his own. It appears that the unrest was a natural and healthy <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> of the people, but <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the same it created a natural and healthy alarm in the manly breasts of the Anglo-Indian Defence Association and it is a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> thing that it has quieted down to some extent. Unfortunately the position is still far from clear or satisfactory to Mr. Lockhart Smith. This healthy unrest is still too healthily restless for Mr. Smith's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span>. He therefore calls upon the leaders of Indian thought to rise to the occasion and handle the situation with a statesmanlike reposefulness. They must learn to be quietly unquiet, restfully restless, humbly aspiring, meekly bold. If they are restless in their unrest, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> will \"put back the hands of the clock\", to the great inconvenience of old Father Time. Perhaps Mr. Lockhart Smith is in the habit of putting back the hands of the clock in his office so as to give his clerks a longer spell of work; otherwise we cannot understand<span class='page-number' id='s-1006' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1006]</span> his sublime confidence in the effectiveness of this trick with the clock or his evident <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> that it will stop the march of Time.\n\n---\n\nOn the whole the advice of Mr. Smith may be summed up as an appeal to spare his nerves. The Viceroy will recognise the position \"as clear and satisfactory\" if the leaders are content to 'aspire' without being over-anxious to get their aspirations realized. We have no doubt he will.\n\n---\n\nAfter Mr. Lockhart Smith had locked up his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> from farther speech, there was a shower of Sparkes. Mr. H. W. S. Sparkes chose the unrest for the theme of his eloquence. Every sentence in the report of his speech is a scintillating piece of brilliance. He said, \"If the wishes of the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, the Extremists, who are thinking of driving the British out of India were granted, they would be the first to go down on their bended knees and ask the Government to stay back and dictate any terms they liked.\" That the people of India are all Extremists, is the first proposition we gather from this remarkable prophecy, that they all want to drive the British out of India is the second. It appears that their wishes are going to be granted, but whether by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> or John <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Morley</span> the prophet does not inform us. At some psychological stage of the process of evictionâ€”after the wishes have been granted and the British have been driven out of India,â€”the Government and Mr. Sparkes are to be intercepted on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Apollo</span> Bunder by a deputation of Bipin Pal, Tilak and Khaparde on bended knees asking them to stay back on any terms rather than deprive India of their beatific presence. This is the first spark.\n\n---\n\nThe second spark is of a somewhat fuliginous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>. Mr. Sparkes hastened to disclaim this remarkable prophecy, it is his foster-child and not his own only begotten son. \"These were not his own views, but of the Bengalis and men who never mixed<span class='page-number' id='s-1007' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1007]</span> in politics.\" They are the views, it seems, of two <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> of men, first, of the Bengalis, then, of men who never mixed in politics; and the opinion of the latter on a political question is no doubt exceptionally valuable. But if this is the opinion of the Bengalis, who then are the people of India who are all Extremists and want to drive the British out in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to have the luxury of asking them back on their bended knees? There seems to be a confusion of Sparkes somewhere.\n\n---\n\nIt appears that \"the Indians are trying to be registered as a nation of the world, but they were fools if they thought that that time had come.\" Here is another brilliant classification, but we do not quite grasp the distinction between a nation of the world and a nation not of the world. It seems to savour of German <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>metaphysics</span> and is too deep for us. Anyway, we observe that Mr. Sparkes differs from the Transvaal authorities, he will not allow Indians to register themselves in the book of the world. What, not even their thumb impressions, Mr. Sparkes?\n\n---\n\n\"The Partition wounded the people of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> to the quick but Mr. Morley had done well in refusing to reopen that question.\" This was the last fitting coruscation of Sparkes, and yet neither the Ganges nor the Maidan was ablaze. After this Mr. Summons with his blood-curdling references to the train-wrecking incident and the Allen affair fell quite flat. He discovered a distinct attempt made to shield the wrong-doers. This is a charge against the police to which we invite the prompt attention of Sir Andrew Fraser. Mr. Summons ought to be called upon either to substantiate his allegation against the Lieutenant-Governor's friends or withdraw it.\n\nSuch was the feast of fancy and the flow of soul which came off last Monday. The end of this once potent Association threatens to be as pitiful as that of the Roman wayâ€”which began in massive dignity and ended in a bog.<span class='page-number' id='s-1008' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1008]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-1-1","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Constitution of the Subjects Committee","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-constitution-of-the-subjects-committee","prvt":"Convention and Conference","prvu":"/cwsa/07/convention-and-conference","dt":"1908-04-04","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-constitution-of-the-subjects-committee"],"t":"The Constitution of the Subjects Committee","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"When we first wrote of the Constitution we pointed out the importance of the Subjects Committee as the first approach towards the democratisation of the Congress.

But before the Subjects Committee came into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> these questions were decided irresponsibly by a small cabal of leaders in secret. When the first difference arose between the old leaders and younger men the prospect of a difference of opinion on the platform of the Congress was sufficient to bring about the substitution of a Committee for the cabal. It was a step forward but a very small step. The Committee was nominated by the cabal, not elected by the Congress, with the result that only those who were likely to be subservient to the cabal, their satellites, their mofussil lieutenants or others who were too prominent to be ignored, became members of the Committee. The change widened the basis of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>oligarchy</span>, it did not introduce a democratic principle. The Committee met to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>consent</span> to what the leaders proposed, the Congress met to consent to what the Committee suggested. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Freedom</span> of discussion was restricted in the Committee by the autocratic intervention of dominant members of the cabal, in the Congress it was tabooed as a violation of unity.\n\nIn any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> constitution of the Congress the election of the Subjects Committee must be regulated by the principles of democratic representation, not of oligarchic nomination.

The only remedy is the frank acceptance of the principle of democratic representation. At Surat when the Bengali delegates were electing their representatives on the Subjects Committee, Srijut Surendranath <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Banerji</span> let fall a remarkable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of sentiment which explains the difficulty felt by the leaders in frankly accepting the principle of district or divisional election which can alone ensure that the Subjects Committee will represent the will of the country. \"If the delegates are allowed to elect their representatives,\" he said, \"the best men will not be chosen.\" The aristocratic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of the objection was a surprise to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> of the delegates, for it contains the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of the oligarchical spirit. The distrust of the people, the sense of aristocratic superiority, the confidence of superior wisdom which it conveyed are the stamp of this spirit in all ages. The best men are the men of position, rank, status, the men with a stake in the country, the men who have succeeded and are on the top of the ladder, and these have a right to lead by virtue of their position apart from the will of the people. The party of privilege in all ages have posed as the superior people, the monopolists of wisdom, the *optimates* or best men, the *boni* or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> people. The party opposed to them are the ignorant, the pestilent demagogues, the crazy fanatics, the men without stake or substance who wish to create a revolution in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> to benefit themselves. If democratic election is allowed, these men will be elected in increasing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>numbers</span> and shoulder out their betters. This spirit of oligarchical exclusiveness is the secret of all the friction which has been evident and the scenes of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span>, strife and disorder, the frequent outbreaks of popular indignation which have marked the Conferences and Congresses since the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> of the democratic spirit. The Congress oligarchs, unwilling to allow that spirit to assert itself, are yet unable to disavow openly the principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> in the name of which they demand from the bureaucracy rights and<span class='page-number' id='s-1010' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1010]</span> privileges which they themselves refuse to the rank and file of their own followers. The conflict goes on behind the scenes and the outbreaks in the Conference or Congress are rare and the results of a growing impatience of the evasions, tricks, shufflings by which the leaders try to hold an untenable position. They can neither disown democracy nor frankly accept it. They are eager to keep up its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span>, determined to exclude its spirit. We shall not dwell farther on this aspect of the question, for the democratic spirit cannot be permanently repressed or baffled by evasions. That the constitution must be based on democratic principles is one of the axioms with which we have started. The Subjects Committee is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of the Congress and must be democratised if the Congress itself is to be democratic. Otherwise we shall have a repetition of the scenes which we are all anxious to avoid. An oligarchical Subjects Committee preparing resolutions which have to be repeatedly challenged in the full house, is an unworkable arrangement. The delegates must be made to feel that the Committee is really representative of their wishes and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> and the inclination to scan with suspicion the Subjects Committee's resolutions and amend them in full house, will then disappear.\n\nThe election of the members of the Committee is at present no election at all, but a scramble for the membership. It must be reduced to order and rule by a serious, settled and deliberate form of election. The representatives of each <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> in a province must be allowed to sit separately and vote their choice of representatives for their own division, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> must be written down by a temporary secretary and handed in to the Secretary for the Province who will read out the full list of names to the assembled delegates of the Province. These names should be sent in to the Secretaries of the Congress who will put in the full list as soon as the President's address is over. In this way the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of forming the Subjects Committee can be done quietly, timely and thoroughly. No objection should be allowed from one division against the choice of another division or from one Province against the choice of another Province.\n\nBut the method of election is not the only obstacle in the<span class='page-number' id='s-1011' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1011]</span> way of full correspondence between the will of the Subjects Committee and the will of the Congress. The method of discussion in the Committee is at present hampered by irregularities which often prevent the real sense of the Committee from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> properly ascertained. It is only when a strong and conscientious President acquainted with the forms of discussion in a free country sits in the chair, that the proceedings of the Committee are worthy of itself. These irregularities arise partly from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ignorance</span> of the rules of debate, partly from over-eagerness to make points and score tactical successes. The only remedy is for the rules of discussion to be formalized, made known to each member and rigidly enforced by the President. When this is done, the habit of orderly discussion will gradually create a public sentiment against excess of party spirit. Finally, the secrecy of the sitting is a feature which ought not to be continued. It is undemocratic in its origin, fosters irresponsibility and helps to create misunderstanding and facilitate crooked methods. There is no reason why our discussions should not be carried out in the full light of day, since we have nothing to conceal; on the contrary, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the discussion in the Subjects Committee will serve the same end as the publicity of Parliamentary discussions in free countries. It will keep up a living interest in the people, educate the public <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> to deal with political questions in a graver and more responsible spirit, accustom the representatives of the people to feel that they are speaking and acting with the eye of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> upon them and train the country to prepare itself the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of mind, speech and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> which are necessary for the success of representative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span>. Secrecy is the enemy of good government, but it is still more fatal to self-government. Publicity is the very breath of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> to democratic institutions.\n\nThese then are the changes which we would suggest for the democratisation of the Subjects Committeeâ€”the members to be elected by the divisions of each Province by a regular and orderly method, the discussions of the Committee to be regulated by fixed rules of procedure and the sitting to be thrown open to the Press and the public or at least to the delegates.

Nowhere have the rulers reduced their subjects to so complete, pervading and abject a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> helplessness. When the Mogul ruled, he ruled as a soldier and a conqueror, in the pride of his strength, in the confidence of his invincible greatness, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of the peoples by natural right of his imperial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> and warlike strength and skill. He stooped to no meanness, hedged himself in with no army of spies, entered into no relations with foreign powers, but, grandiose and triumphant, sat on the throne of a continent like <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indra</span> on his heavenly seat, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> of his world because there was none strong enough to dispute it with him. He trusted his subjects, gave them positions of power and responsibility, used their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> and arm to preserve his conquests and by the royalty of that trust and noble pride in his own ability to stand by his innate strength, was able to hold India for over a century until Aurangzeb forgot the *kuladharma* of his house and by distrust, tyranny and meanness lost for his descendants the splendid heritage of his forefathers. The present domination is a rule of shopkeepers who are at the same time bureaucrats, a combination of the worst possible qualities for imperial <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span>. The shopkeeper rules by deceit, the bureaucrat by the use of red tape. The shopkeeper by melancholy meanness alienates the subject population, the bureaucrat by soulless rigidity deprives the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> and human sympathy.

The shopkeeper becomes a pocket Machiavel, the bureaucrat a gigantic retail trader. By this confusion of *dharmas, varnashankara* is born in high places and the nation first and the rulers afterwards go to perdition. This is what has happened in India under the present regime. The bureaucracy has ruled in the spirit of a mercantile power, holding its position by aid of mercenaries, afraid of its subjects, with no confidence in its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>, with no trust even in the mercenaries who support it, piling up gold with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> hand, with the other holding a borrowed sword over the head of a fallen people. It has sought its strength not in the mission with which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> had entrusted it, nor in the greatness of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>, her mastery of the ocean, her pride of unconquered prowess, her just and sympathetic principle of government, but in the weakness of the people. The strength of England has been held as a threat in the background, not as a source of quiet and unostentatious self-confidence which enable the rulers to be generous as well as just. The liberal principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> rule have been chanted as a sort of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> *mantra* to hypnotise the nation into willing subjection, not used as a living principle of government. What have been the real sources of bureaucratic strength? An arms act, a corrupt and oppressive police, an army of spies, a mercenary military <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> officered by Englishmen, a people emasculated, kept ignorant, out of the world's life, poor, intimidated, abjectly under the thumb of the police constable or the provincial prefect. Such a principle of rule cannot endure. It contradicts the law of God and offends the reason of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>; it is as unprofitable as it is selfish and heartless.\n\nThe nation which has passed through a century of such a misgovernment must necessarily have degenerated. The bureaucracy has taken care to destroy every centre of strength not subservient to itself. A nation politically disorganised, a nation morally corrupted, intellectually pauperised, physically broken and stunted is the result of a hundred years of British rule, the account which England can give before God of the trust which He placed in her hands. The condition of the people is the one answer to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the songs of praise which the bureaucrats sing<span class='page-number' id='s-1015' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1015]</span> of their rule, which the people of England chorus with such a smug self-satisfaction and which even foreign peoples echo in the tune of admiration and praise. But for us the people who have suffered, the victims of the miserable misuse which bureaucrats have made of the noblest opportunity God ever gave to a nation, the song has no longer any charm, the *mantra* has lost its hypnotic force, the spell has ceased to work. While we could we deceived ourselves, but we can deceive ourselves no longer. Pain is a terrible disillusioner and the pangs which had come upon us were those of approaching <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dissolution</span>. It was at the last moment, when further delay would have meant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, that a higher than earthly physician administered through a proud viceroy the potent poison of Partition and saved the life of India. The treatment of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> has been drastic and will continue to be drastic. There are those who dream of mild remedies, whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beautiful</span> souls will not bear to think of the fierceness of strife, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span> and agony which a revolution implies; but strong poisons are the only salvation in desperate diseases and we <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> that without these poisons India will not easily or ever recover from the fatal and consuming disease which has overtaken her.\n\nWhat will support her under the stress of the agony she will have to undergo? What strength will <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> her to shake off the weaknesses which have crowded in on her? How will she raise herself from the dust whom a thousand shackles bind down? Only the strength of a superhuman ideal, only the gigantic force of a superhuman will, only the vehemence of an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> which transcends all that man has done and approaches <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divinity</span>. Where will she find that strength, that force, that vehemence? In herself. We have seen Ramamurti, the modern Bhimasen, lie motionless, resistant, with a superhuman force of will power acting through the muscles while two carts loaded with men are driven over his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span>. India must undergo an ordeal of passive <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span> far more terrible without relaxing a single fibre of her frame. We have seen Ramamurti break over his chest a strong iron chain tightened round his whole body and break it by the sheer force of will working through the body. India must work a similar deliverance for herself by the same inner force. It is not<span class='page-number' id='s-1016' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1016]</span> by strength of body that Ramamurti accomplishes his feats, for he is not stronger than many athletes who could never do what he does daily, but by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and will. India has in herself a faith of superhuman virtue to accomplish <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span>, to deliver herself out of irrefragable bondage, to bring God down upon earth. She has a secret of will power which no other nation possesses. All she needs to rouse in her that faith, that will, is an ideal which will induce her to make the effort. That ideal is now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> preached by Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal in every speech he delivers and never has it been delivered with such <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beauty</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>, such a passion of earnestness and pathos, such a sublimity of feeling as at Uttarpara on Sunday when he addressed a meeting of the people in the compound of the Uttarpara Library. The ideal is that of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> in God, of God in humanity, the ancient ideal of the *sanatana <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>* but applied as it has never been applied before to the problem of politics and the work of national revival. To realise that ideal, to impart it to the world is the mission of India. She has evolved a religion which embraces all that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, the brain, the practical faculty of man can desire but she has not yet applied it to the problems of modern politics. This therefore is the work which she has still to do before she can help humanity; the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of this mission is the justification for her resurgence, the great incentive of saving herself to save <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> is the native power which will give her the force, the strength, the vehemence which can alone enable her to realise her destiny. No lesser ideal will help her through the stress of the terrible ordeal which she will in a few years be called to face. No hope less pure will save her from the demoralisation which follows revolutionary strife, the growth of passions, a violent selfishness, sanguinary hatred, insufferable licence, the disruption of moralities, the resurgence of the tiger in man which a great revolution is apt to foster. Srijut Bipin Chandra speaks under an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> which he himself is unable to resist.

Such a time has now come in the world's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>.\n\nIn former ages India was a sort of hermitage of thought and peace apart from the world. Separated from the rest of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> by her peculiar geographical conformation, she worked out her own problems and thought out the secrets of existence as in a quiet *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ashram</span>* from which the noise of the world was shut out. Her thoughts flashed out over Asia and created civilisations, her sons were the bearers of light to the peoples; philosophies based themselves on stray fragments of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>infinite</span> wisdom; sciences arose from the waste of her intellectual production. When the barrier was broken and nations began to surge through the Himalayan gates, the peace of India departed. She passed through centuries of struggle, of ferment in which the civilisations born<span class='page-number' id='s-1020' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1020]</span> of her random thoughts returned to her developed and insistent, seeking to impose themselves on the mighty mother of them all. To her they were the reminiscences of her old intellectual experiments laid aside and forgotten. She took them up, rethought them in a new light and once more made them part of herself. So she dealt with the Greek, so with the Scythian, so with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span>, so now she will deal with the great brood of her returning children, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span>, with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Buddhism</span>, with European science and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>materialism</span>, with the fresh speculations born of the world's renewed contact with the source of thought in this ancient cradle of religion, science and philosophy. The vast amount of new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> which she has to absorb, is unprecedented in her history, but to her it is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>child</span>'s play. Her all-embracing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, her penetrating intuition, her invincible originality are equal to greater tasks. The period of passivity when she listened to the voices of the outside world is over. No longer will she be content merely to receive and reproduce, even to receive and improve. The genius of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japan</span> lies in imitation and improvement, that of India in origination. The contributions of outside peoples she can only accept as rough material for her immense creative faculty. It was the mission of England to bring this rough material to India, but in the arrogance of her material success she presumed to take upon herself the role of a teacher and treated the Indian people partly as an infant to be instructed, partly as a serf to be schooled to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for its lords. The farce is played out. England's mission in India is over and it is time for her to recognise the limit of the lease given to her. When it was <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span>'s will that she should possess India, the world was amazed at the miraculous ease of the conquest and gave all the credit to the unparalleled genius and virtues of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> people, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fiction</span> which England was not slow to encourage and on which she has traded for over a century. The real truth is suggested in the famous saying that England conquered India in a fit of absence of mind, which is only another way of saying that she did not conquer it at all. It was placed in her hands without her realising what was <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> done or how it was being done. The necessary conditions were created for her, her path made easy,<span class='page-number' id='s-1021' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1021]</span> the instruments given into her hands. The men who worked for her were of comparatively small intellectual stature and with few exceptions did not make and could not have made any mark in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European history</span> where no special Providence was at work to supplement the deficiencies of the instruments. The subjugation of India is explicable neither in the ability of the men whose <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span> figure as the protagonists nor in the superior genius of the conquering <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> nor in the weakness of the conquered peoples. It is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of the standing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span> of history. In other words, it was one of those cases in which a particular mission was assigned to a people not otherwise superior to the rest of the world and a special *faustitas* or decreed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fortune</span> set to watch over the fulfilment of the mission. Her mission once over, the angel of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> who stood by England in her task and removed opponents and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> with the waving of his hand, will no longer shield her. She will stay so long as the destinies of India need her and not a day longer, for it is not by her own strength that she came or is still here, and it is not by her own strength that she can remain. The resurgence of India is begun, it will accomplish itself with her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span>, if she will, without it if she does not, against it if she opposes.<span class='page-number' id='s-1022' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1022]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-asiatic-role","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Love Me or Die","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/love-me-or-die","prvt":"The New Ideal","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-new-ideal","dt":"1908-04-09","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["love-me-or-die"],"t":"Love Me or Die","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The Editor of the Urdu *Swarajya* has been warned to refrain from seditious writings.

If we are content with what we have done, even that little will disappear, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> will be abortive and the country fall back into its former condition. It is therefore necessary to give a new impetus to the movement everywhere, and now that Srijut Bipin Chandra is out of prison, the necessary will no doubt be done. The first work is to revive courage in the hearts of the people. The effect of the recent repression has been not to crush the movement, but to discourage its outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>. This discouragement must be removed. We cannot allow the movement to be driven inward and become an affair of secret societies and terrorism as it will inevitably become if the outward <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of it is stopped. The next work is to give a stronger impetus to the boycott, so that the little that we have gained may become the starting-point for fresh victories; the organisation of boycott is the first work to which we should set our hands. The third thing to be done is to spread National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>. A serious <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> must be made to take in hand the raising of funds for this branch of national activity, so that the National Council may be in a position both to effect the complete organisation of its scientific, technical and other sides and to extend aid to the increasing number of schools which are springing up <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> over the country. It is also necessary to bring the existing primary schools under the Council; for this is a work of great importance, and until it is done, the foundations of the new educational edifice will not be secure, since it is the primary schools in which the bulk of the people are educated. If the present institutions will not come into the new system, the<span class='page-number' id='s-1024' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1024]</span> country must be covered with a network of new primary schools on national lines, such as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> which is now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> projected at Uttarpara,â€”schools <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> a primary literary education along with such technical instruction as will enable the students to earn a livelihood as small artisans. If this is done, the public will flock into the national institutions and the old primary schools will perish.\n\nSo much is necessary for the completion of the work for which we have already laid a foundation, but the time has come when we should start actively on fresh lines. The most important of these is arbitration, which will, if successfully carried out, form the basis of our future self-government. Education will give us the necessary training of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span> for self-government, arbitration will provide a practical field in which our capacities can be tested. In some parts the work has already been begun and with remarkable success, but it is necessary to lay the foundations all over <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>difficulties</span> that lie in its way are not so insuperable as they at first appear; if the lawyer class can be provided with a means of living by the arbitration system, their passive opposition, which is the only real obstacle to be dreaded, can be removed. The existing courts will provide careers for those who wish to earn large fortunes in the legal line, but the host of small practitioners in the mofussil are those who will be affected by the spread of arbitration and some provision must be made in our arbitration schemes by which their field, if restricted, may not be entirely destroyed. This subject is one which demands detailed treatment and it will be the theme of a future article. At present we wish only to emphasize its great importance.\n\nWhen we have laid the foundations of arbitration, our work is not finished; the positive side of it only has been done. There is another side less palpable, but even more important, and it is the destructive or negative side, the removal of old prepossessions, false beliefs, false <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> from the mind of the people. So long as the least little of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> in the bureaucracy remains in the lowest class of our population, the conditions of success are not complete. The bureaucracy is itself doing much to destroy the<span class='page-number' id='s-1025' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1025]</span> ancient faith in its philanthropy, integrity and high motive which was the source of its strength, but this is chiefly in the educated class and the landed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span>, both of which, whatever the outward professions, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> or self-interest may dictate, are now thoroughly alienated. The only work which remains to be done so far as these <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span> are concerned, is to generate faith in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>; for so far as moderatism still prevails, it is not owing to faith in the bureaucracy but to distrust in the nation. The lower classes have still to be inoculated with the spirit of self-help, separation from the alien and confidence in their own countrymen. To some extent the work has been done, the seed has been sown; Swadeshi is the seedbed of this spirit of self-reliance, this sense of separateness and, at least among the Hindu <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, Swadeshi is deeply rooted in all classes. But this seed has yet to fructify and spring up. The only way in which this can be done is to destroy the barriers between the educated class and the peasantry which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span> education has created, to restore the old unity of society by mutual service, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, by self-identification with the mass of our countrymen. The volunteer movement, now in a rudimentary state, has to be developed and perfected so as to form the bridge of communication between the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the people and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of the educated community. Our propaganda among the masses must consist less in the teaching of ideas than in teaching by acts, less in intellectual conviction than in the appeal to the heart and to the imagination. No time should be lost in taking this work in hand, the days are passing by with great swiftness and bringing us nearer and nearer to the final struggle when the people and the bureaucracy will stand face to face. On that day the masses will weigh down the scale and decide victory or defeat.<span class='page-number' id='s-1026' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1026]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-work-before-us","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Campbell-Bannerman Retires","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/campbell-bannerman-retires","prvt":"Love Me or Die","prvu":"/cwsa/07/love-me-or-die","dt":"1908-04-10","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["campbell-bannerman-retires"],"t":"Campbell-Bannerman Retires","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"The resignation of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman leaves things for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> just where they were, but it is of some importance for<span class='page-number' id='s-1026' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1026]</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>, as it is not unlikely that the transference of leadership to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> of Mr. Asquith's cold, hard and unsympathetic Whiggism may lead to an early disruption of the Liberal majority.

If, again, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> our efforts at union fail and the New party be compelled to face troubles and persecutions, that should also be taken as a divinely appointed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. We shall not be eager for compromise to avoid trouble and persecution, as sufferings are welcome if it be God's will that we should suffer, that our Mother <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> would be saved. But in the meantime, we are a democratic party. At Pabna, at Dhulia and other places, people wanted a united Congress and it is our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> to try for it if no vital principle is sacrificed to gain that end. This was the speaker's apology for the attempt at union, though, as he said, his hopes were not high about the success of the attempt. The Congress broke up not over personalities, but over certain definite issues which were (1) irregularities in the election of the President, (2) the attempt from certain quarters to take advantage of the local majority to recede from the four Calcutta resolutions, (3) the attempt to impose a creed by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of a local majority with a view to exclude a large and growing party. Under the circumstances it was necessary to oppose the whole thing tooth and nail.

But how to carry out the opinion of the people? We are ready to condone this irregularity if a united Congress is to be held on the basis of the Calcutta resolutions. If the other party does not accept, the responsibility of breaking up the Congress and having a party institution in its place will be on their shoulders. Our position is: let us work on our different party lines through our own institutions, but at the same time let us have the united Congress of the whole people.<span class='page-number' id='s-1029' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1029]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/united-congress","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Demand of the Mother","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-demand-of-the-mother","prvt":"Campbell-Bannerman Retires","prvu":"/cwsa/07/campbell-bannerman-retires","dt":"1908-04-10","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-demand-of-the-mother"],"t":"The Demand of the Mother","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We have lost the faculty of religious fervour in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> and are now trying to recover it through the passion for the country, by self-sacrifice, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>labour</span> for our fellow-countrymen, by absorption in the idea of the country.

Bengal has always lived by its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>emotions</span>; the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span>, as it has been called, is also the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of India. The loss of emotional power, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span>, of enthusiasm would dry up the sources from which she derives her strength. The country of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nyaya</span> is also the country of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Chaitanya</span> who himself was born in the height of the intellectual development of Bengal as its fine flower and most perfect <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span>. If now she tries to recover her enthusiasm and perfect power of self-abandonment, it must be through a means which her new environment provides. This new environment has been responsible for the loss of her springs of vitality; it had turned the Bengalis into a sceptical people prone to swear at and disbelieve in everything great, noble and inspiring. The recovery of her old spirit of enthusiastic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> has come about through the sense of political unity which had been slowly developing in the heart of the people as the result of the new environment. That which had supplied the poison, supplied also the cure. If she is to complete the restoration to her true self, the first requisite is that the enthusiasm, the idealism of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> should be kept alive. The perfect sense of self-abandonment which Chaitanya felt for Hari, must be felt by Bengal for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the Mother</span>. Then only will Bengal be herself and able to fulfil the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> to which after<span class='page-number' id='s-1030' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1030]</span> so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> centuries of preparation she has been called.\n\nThe great religions of the world have <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> laid stress on self-abandonment as the source of salvation and the law applies not only to spiritual salvation but to the destinies of a people. Self-abandonment will alone give salvation. He who loses his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, shall keep it, and the life of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> must be the sacrifice for the life of the nation. When the people of Bengal are able to rise to the full height and depth of this idea they will find the secret of success which till now has escaped them. It is not by patriotic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> that a nation can be liberated, it is not by patriotic work that a nation can be built. For every stone that is added to the national edifice, a life must be given. It is not talk of Swaraj that can bring Swaraj but it is the living of Swaraj by each <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> among us that will compel Swaraj to come. The kingdom of Heaven is within you; free India is no piece of wood or stone that can be carved into the likeness of a nation but lives in the hearts of those who desire her, and out of these she must be created. We must first ourselves be free in heart before our country can be free. \"There is no British jail which can hold me,\" said the great Upadhyay before his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, and he died to prove the truth of his words; but his words are true for all of us that aspire to liberate our Mother, whether we prove it by our lives or by our death. When her sons have learned to be free in themselves, free in prison, free under the yoke which they seek to remove, free in life, free in death, when the text of Upadhyay's words will receive their illuminating commentary in the actions of a people, then the chains will fall off of themselves and outward circumstances be forced to obey the law of our inward life.\n\nHow then can we live Swaraj? By abandonment of the idea of self and its replacement by the idea of the nation. As Chaitanya ceased to be Nimai Pandit and became <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span>, became Radha, became Balaram, so every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> of us must cease to cherish his separate life and live in the nation. The hope of national regeneration must absorb our minds as the idea of salvation absorbs the minds of the *mumukshu*. Our *tyaga* must be as complete as the *tyaga* of the nameless <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span>. Our passion to see the face of our free and glorified Mother must be as devouring<span class='page-number' id='s-1031' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1031]</span> a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span> as the passion of Chaitanya to see the face of Sri Krishna. Our sacrifice for the country must be as enthusiastic and complete as that of Jagai and Madhai who left the rule of a kingdom to follow the *sankirtan* of Gauranga. Our offerings on the altar must be as wildly liberal, as remorselessly complete as that of Carthaginian parents who passed their children through the fire to Moloch. If any reservation mars the completeness of our self-abandonment, if any bargaining abridges the fullness of our sacrifice, if any doubt mars the strength of our faith and enthusiasm, if any thought of self pollutes the sanctity of our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>, then the Mother will not be satisfied and will continue to withhold her presence. We <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> her to come, but the call has not yet gone out of the bottom of our hearts. The Mother's feet are on the threshold, but she waits to hear the true cry, the cry that rushes out from the heart, before she will enter. We are still hesitating between ourselves and the country; we would give one <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anna</span> to the service of the Mother and keep fifteen for ourselves, our wives, our children, our property, our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fame</span> and reputation, our safety, our ease. The Mother asks all before she will give herself. Not until Surath Raja offered the blood of his veins did the Mother appear to him and ask him to choose his boon. Not until Shivaji was ready to offer his head at the feet of the Mother, did Bhavani in visible form stay his hand and give him the command to free his people. Those who have freed nations, have first passed through the agony of utter renunciation before their efforts were crowned with success, and those who aspire to free India, will first have to pay the price which the Mother demands. The schemes by which we seek to prepare the nation, the scheme of industrial regeneration, the scheme of educational regeneration, the scheme of political regeneration through self-help are subordinate features of the deeper regeneration which the country must go through before it can be free. The Mother asks us for no schemes, no plans, no methods. She herself will provide the schemes, the plans, the methods better than any that we can devise. She asks us for our hearts, our lives, nothing less, nothing more. Swadeshi, National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>, the attempt to organise Swaraj are only so many opportunities for self<span class='page-number' id='s-1032' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1032]</span> surrender to her. She will look to see not how much we have tried for Swadeshi, how wisely we have planned for Swaraj, how successfully we have organised education, but how much of ourselves we have given, how much of our substance, how much of our labour, how much of our ease, how much of our safety, how much of our lives. Regeneration is literally rebirth and rebirth comes not by the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, not by the fullness of the purse, not by policy, not by change of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span>, but by the getting of a new heart by throwing away all that we were into the fire of sacrifice and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> reborn in the Mother. Self-abandonment is the demand made upon us. She asks of us, \"How many will live for me? How many will die for me?\" and awaits our answer.<span class='page-number' id='s-1033' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1033]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-demand-of-the-mother","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Baruipur Speech","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/baruipur-speech","prvt":"United Congress","prvu":"/cwsa/07/united-congress","dt":"1908-04-11","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["baruipur-speech"],"t":"Baruipur Speech","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Delivered in Baruipur, Bengal, on 12 April 1908.

He pointed out that through a foreign system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> developing foreign tastes and tendencies he had been denationalised like his country and like his country again he is now trying to renationalise himself.\n\nNext he referred to the comparative want of the Swadeshi spirit in West <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> to which Shyamsunder Babu made very polite reference, himself coming from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal. But Sj. Ghose as he belonged to West Bengal had no hesitation in admitting the drawback. This superiority of East Bengal he attributed solely to its privilege of suffering of late from the regulation *lathis* and imprisonment administered by the alien bureaucracy. He offered the same explanation of the increase of the strength of boycott in Calcutta after the disturbances at the Beadon Square of which the police were the sole authors. The speaker dilated on the great efficacy of suffering in rousing the spirit from slumber by a reference to the parable of two birds in the Upanishads so often referred to by the late Swami Vivekananda. The parable relates that there was a big tree with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> sweet and bitter fruits and two birds sat on the tree, one on the top of it and the other at a lower part. The latter bird looking upwards sees the other in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> his glory and richness of plumage and is at times enamoured of him and feels that he is no other than his own highest self. But at other moments when he tastes the sweet fruits of the tree he is<span class='page-number' id='s-1034' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1034]</span> so much taken up with their sweetness that he quite forgets his dear and beloved companion. After a while there comes the turn of bitter fruits, the unpleasant taste of which breaks off the spell and he looks at his brilliant companion again. This is evidently a parable concerning the salvation of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> souls who when they enjoy the sweets of the world forget to look upwards to the Paramatma who is really none else than their own highest self, and when they forget themselves in this way through the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>maya</span>* of this world, bitterness comes to dispel the *maya* and revive the true self-consciousness.\n\nThe parable is equally applicable to national *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mukti</span>*. We in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> fell under the influence of the foreigners' *maya* which completely possessed our souls. It was the *maya* of the alien rule, the alien <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>, the powers and capacities of the alien people who happen to rule over us. These were as if so many shackles that put our physical, intellectual and moral life in bondage. We went to school with the aliens, we allowed the aliens to teach us and draw our minds away from all that was great and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> in us. We considered ourselves unfit for self-government and political life, we looked to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span> as our exemplar and took her as our saviour. And all this was *maya* and bondage. When this *maya* once got its hold on us, put on us shackle after shackle, we had fallen into bondage of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> by their education, commercial bondage, political bondage, etc., and we believed ourselves to be helpless without them. We helped them to destroy what life there was in India. We were under the protection of their police and we know now what protection they have given us. Nay, we ourselves became the instruments of our bondage. We Bengalis entered the services of foreigners. We brought in the foreigners and established their rule. Fallen as we were, we needed others to protect us, to teach us and even to feed us. So utterly was our self-dependence destroyed that we were unable to fulfil every function of human life.\n\nIt is only through repression and suffering that this *maya* can be dispelled, and the bitter fruit of Partition of Bengal administered by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> dispelled the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>illusion</span>.

Thus we found Swaraj within ourselves and saw that it was in our hands to discover and to realise it.\n\nSome people tell us that we have not the strength to stand upon our own legs without the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of the aliens and we should therefore work in co-operation with and also in opposition to them. But can you depend on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> and *maya* at the same time? In proportion as you depend on others the bondage of *maya* will be upon you. The first thing that a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> must do is to realise the true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> that lies within and it is only when you understand that free within is free without, you will be really free. It is for this reason that we preach the gospel of unqualified Swaraj and it is for this that Bhupen and Upadhyay refused to plead before the alien court. Upadhyay saw the necessity of realising Swaraj within us and hence he gave himself up to it. He said that he was free and the Britishers could not bind him; his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> is a parable to our nation. There is no power so great that can make India subject; when we will say this, God will make us free. Herein lies the true significance of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>national education</span>, boycott, Swadeshi, arbitration. Do not be afraid of obstacles in your path, it does not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> how great the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span> are that stand in your way, God commands you to be free and you must be free. We ask you to give up the school under the control of the foreign bureaucracy and point out to you national education, we ask you to keep away from the legal system which prevails in your country as it is a source of financial and moral downfallâ€”another link in the chain of *maya*. Do not suffer in bondage and *maya*. Leave this *maya* alone and come away. Don't think that anything is impossible when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>miracles</span> are being worked out on every side. If you are true to yourself there is nothing to be afraid of. There is nothing unattainable by truth, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>. This is your whole gospel which will work out miracles. Never indulge in equivocations for your ease and safety. Do not invite weakness, stand upright.

The present conditions of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span> in this country are full of the germs of the Occidental malady, and if India is to escape from it, it must be, first, by getting rid of these conditions and, secondly, by seeking refuge in its own superior civilisation. The work of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> is therefore twofold. It has to win Swaraj for India so that the present unhealthy conditions of political life, full of the germs of that social and political phthisis which is overtaking <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>, may be entirely and radically cured, and it has to ensure that the Swaraj it brings about shall be a Swadeshi Swaraj and not an importation of the European article. It is for<span class='page-number' id='s-1039' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1039]</span> this reason that the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> for Swaraj found its first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> in an outburst of Swadeshi sentiment which directed itself not merely against foreign goods, but against foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span>, foreign dress and manners, foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, and sought to bring the people back to their own civilization. It was the instinctive protest of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nature</span> against the malady that was eating its way into the national system and threatening to corrupt its blood and disturb the soundness of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span>. If there were some irrational features in the revolt of the people against foreign things, it was the violence of the malady which necessitated the violence of the reaction. The late Upadhyay was the type and champion of this feature of the national movement. He was never weary of harping on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span> of stripping from ourselves every rag of borrowed <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> and habits and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>becoming</span> intensely, uncompromisingly Indian. When we put aside <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> the mannerisms of that strong personality and seek its kernel, we find that this was his message and the meaning of his life. After himself going through all the phases of Europeanised thought and religion, he returned like his country with a violent rebound to the religion, the thoughts, the habits and the speech of his forefathers. It is the spirit of old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> which incarnated itself in him, with the strength, courage, passionate adherence to conviction which was the temperament of old Bengal and which modern Bengal had for a period lost. His declaration in Court and his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> put a seal upon the meaning of his life and left his name stamped indelibly on the pages of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> as a saint and martyr of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>. It washed out all human weakness and impurity with the wave of a great spiritual act of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>devotion</span> and renunciation and left the soul of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> only for posterity to cherish. We have to take up his work and incorporate the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of it into the accomplished heritage of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>.\n\nThe return to ourselves is the cardinal feature of the national movement. It is national not only in the sense of political self-assertion against the domination of foreigners, but in the sense of a return upon our old national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>. It is significant that all those who are out of touch with this feature of the movement, are losing their position at its head, while those who keep in its<span class='page-number' id='s-1040' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1040]</span> forefront are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> more and more suffused with the spirit of \"Indianity\" and overcome with the spell of India, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>magic</span> of her thought and civilisation, the overpowering touch of her religion. The highest qualities of head and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> cannot keep the lead for men who have not the saving <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of openness to this passion for India as she was, is and will be. On the other hand men perhaps of inferior calibre are likely to do better work for the country, who have the power to respond. The secret of this peculiar feature of the movement is to be found in its essential nature and in the purpose which <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> intends it to serve. If India follows in the footsteps of Europe, accepts her political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span>, social system, economic principles, she will be overcome with the same maladies. Such a consummation is neither for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of India nor for the good of Europe. If India becomes an intellectual province of Europe, she will never attain to her natural greatness or fulfil the possibilities within her. *Paradharmo bhayavahah*, to accept the *<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>* of another is perilous; it deprives the man or the nation of its secret of life and vitality and substitutes an unnatural and stunted growth for the free, large and organic development of Nature. Whenever a nation has given up the purpose of its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, it has been at the cost of its growth. India must remain India if she is to fulfil her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>. Nor will Europe profit by grafting her civilisation on India, for if India, who is the distinct physician of Europe's maladies, herself falls into the clutch of the disease, the disease will remain uncured and incurable and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European civilisation</span> will perish as it perished when Rome declined, first by dry rot within itself and last by irruption from without. The success of the national movement, both as a political and as a spiritual movement, is necessary for India and still more necessary for Europe.

This loss of position and prestige with the bureaucracy is the ruling motive with the Bombay Moderates, the fear of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> involved in the persecution to which the Nationalists willingly expose themselves, is the dominant thought among the respectabilities of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>. Another powerful incentive to the hope of getting rid of the Nationalist opposition to their monopoly of influence and control in the country itself when the Nationalists are isolated for the fury of the bureaucracy to wreak on them its vengeance for the awakening of India. \"The Nationalists are using us as a shield,\" the cry goes, \"and we refused to be used, in that unheroic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>.\" Whether the Nationalists have or have not the courage to face the full fury of bureaucratic persecution and the strength to survive it is a question which will probably be decided before another year is out.

Mr. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gokhale</span> placed his justification in his ardent passion for elegant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span>, but the resolutions of the Congress are not such literary masterpieces that this particular <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> should have evoked the dead and gone schoolmaster in Mr. Gokhale's breast. It is clear that the desire of the former was to get rid of the idea of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> from the resolution, because the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> towards nationality is offensive to the bureaucracy and to avoid offence to the bureaucracy is, according to Moderate politics, the first condition of political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> in India. The change of a word for the sake of literary elegance was not surely so essential that the Moderates had to prefer breaking the Congress to breaking the rules of English rhetoric. The opposition to the boycott resolution as originally framed has no root except in fear. No Indian in his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of hearts can fail to sympathise with the boycott even when he has not the patriotism or the selflessness to practise it himself; for boycott is the first expression of our national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, the first condition for the success of Swadeshi and the standing evidence of national revival. But the boycott is as a red rag to John Bull and the Moderate therefore is anxious to throw away the red rag or at least put it in his pocket so long as he is in the same field with the bull. \"Wore horns\" is the whole significance of the opposition to boycott, whatever economical or political excuses may be put forward by way of apology. The separatist policy is a policy of fear, selfishness and spite.\n\nIs it possible for a policy of this kind to be a force in the country or for a party actuated by such motives to keep the peoples in its hands?<span class='page-number' id='s-1045' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1045]</span>\n\nStrength against weakness, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> against <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>, aspiration against self-distrust, self-immolation against self-preservation,â€”this is the real issue between Conventionalist and Nationalist, and it cannot be doubted which will survive.<span class='page-number' id='s-1046' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1046]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/conventionalist-and-nationalist","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Palli Samiti","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/palli-samiti","prvt":"Om Shantih","prvu":"/cwsa/07/om-shantih","dt":"1908-04-18","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["palli-samiti"],"t":"Palli Samiti","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"desc":"*Speech delivered in Kishoregunj, east Bengal, on 20 April 1908.

As one of the speakers has already said, the village Samiti is the seed of Swaraj. What is Swaraj but the organization of the independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of the country into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>centres</span> of strength which grow out of its conditions and answer to its needs, so as to make a single and organic whole? When a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> is in a natural condition, growing from within and existing from within and in its own strength, then it develops its own centres and correlates them according to its own needs. But as soon as for any reason this natural condition is interrupted and a foreign organism establishes itself in and dominates in the country, then that foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> draws to itself all the sources of nourishment and the natural centres, deprived of their sustenance, fail and disappear. It is for this reason that foreign rule can never be for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> of a nation, never work for its true progress and life, but must always work towards its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span>. This is no new discovery, no recently invented theory of ours, but an ascertained truth of political science as taught in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> by Europeans to Europeans. It is there laid down that foreign rule is inorganic and therefore tends to disintegrate the subject body politic by destroying its proper <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>organs</span> and centres of life. If a subject nation is ever to recover and survive, it can only be by reversing the process and re-establishing its own organic centres of life and strength. We in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> had our own instruments of life and growth; we had the self-dependent village; we had the Zamindar as the link between the village units and the central governing body and the central governing body itself was one<span class='page-number' id='s-1047' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1047]</span> in which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the nation beat. All these have been either destroyed or crippled by the intrusion of the foreign organism. If we are to survive as a nation we must restore the centres of strength which are natural and necessary to our growth, and the first of these, the basis of all the rest, the old foundation of Indian life and secret of Indian vitality was the self-dependent and self-sufficient village organism. If we are to organize Swaraj we must base it on the village. But we must at the same time take care to avoid the mistake which did much in the past to retard our national growth. The village must not in our new national life be isolated as well as self-sufficient, but must feel itself bound up with the life of its neighbouring units, living with them in a common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>group</span> for common purposes. Each group again must feel itself part of the life of the district, living in the district unity, so each district must not be engrossed in its own separate <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> but feel itself a subordinate part of the single life of the province, and the province in its turn of the single life of the country. Such is the plan of reconstruction we have taken in hand, but to make it a healthy growth and not an artificial construction we must begin at the bottom and work up to the apex. The village is the cell of the national body and the cell-life must be healthy and developed for the national body to be healthy and developed. Swaraj begins from the village.\n\nTake another point of view. Swaraj is the organization of national self-help, national self-dependence. As soon as the foreign organism begins to dominate the body politic, it compels the whole body to look to it as the centre of its activities and neglect its own organs of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> till these become atrophied. We in India allowed this tendency of alien domination to affect us so powerfully that we have absolutely lost the habit and for some time had lost the desire of independent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span> and became so dependent and inert that there can be found no example of such helplessness and subservience in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span>. The whole of our national life was swallowed up by this dependence. Swaraj will only be possible if this habit of subservience is removed and replaced by a habit of self-help. We must take back our life into our own hands and the change must be immediate,<span class='page-number' id='s-1048' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1048]</span> complete and drastic. It is no use employing half-measures, for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> is radical and the cure must be radical also. Our aim must be to revolutionize our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> and leave absolutely no corner of our life and activities in which the habit of dependence is allowed to linger or find refuge for its insidious and destructive workings; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>commerce</span>, industry, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> among ourselves, protection, sanitation, public works, one by one we must take them all back into our hands. Here again the village Samiti is an indispensable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span>, for as this resolution declares, the village Samiti is not to be a mere council for deliberation, but a strong organ of executive work. It is to set up village schools in which our children will grow up as good citizens and patriots to live for their country and not for themselves or for the privilege of a dependent life in a dependent nation. It is to take up the work of arbitration by which we shall recover control of the administration of justice, of self-protection, of village sanitation, of small local public works, so that the life of the village may again be self-reliant and self-sufficient, free from the habit of dependence rooted in the soil. Self-help and self-dependence, the first conditions of Swaraj, depend for their organisation on the village Samiti.\n\nAnother essential condition of Swaraj is that we should awaken the political sense of the masses. There may have been a time in history when it was enough that a few <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>classes</span>, the ruling classes, the learned classes, at most the trading classes should be awake. But the organisation of the modern nation depends on the awakening of the political sense in the mass. This is the age of the people, the million, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span>. If any nation wishes to survive in the modern struggle, if it wishes to recover or maintain Swaraj, it must awaken the people and bring them into the conscious life of the nation, so that every <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> may feel that in the nation he lives, with the prosperity of the nation he prospers, in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of the nation he is free. This work again depends on the village Samiti. Unless we organise the united life of the village we cannot bridge over the gulf between the educated and the masses. It is here that their lives meet and that they can feel unity. The work of the village<span class='page-number' id='s-1049' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1049]</span> Samiti will be to make the masses feel Swaraj in the village, Swaraj in the group of villages, Swaraj in the district, Swaraj in the nation. They cannot immediately rise to the conception of Swaraj in the nation, they must be trained to it through the perception of Swaraj in the village. The political education of the masses is impossible unless you organise the village Samiti.\n\nSwaraj, finally, is impossible without unity. But the unity we need for Swaraj is not a unity of opinion, a unity of speech, a unity of intellectual conviction. Unity is of the heart and springs from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span>. The foreign organism which has been living on us, lives by the absence of this love, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span>, and it perpetuates the condition of its existence by making us look to it as the centre of our lives and away from our Mother and her children. It has set Hindu and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> at variance by means of this outward outlook; for by regarding it as the fountain of life, however, we are led to look away from our brothers and yearn for what the alien strength can give us. The Hindu first fell a prey to this lure and it was the Mahomedan who was then feared and held down. Now that the Hindu is estranged, the same lure is held out to the Mahomedan and the brother communities kept estranged because they look to the foreigner for the source of prosperity and honours and not to their own Mother. Again, in the old days we did not hear of this distress of the scarcity of water from which the country is suffering now so acutely. It did not exist and could not exist because there was love and the habit of mutual assistance which springs from love. The Zamindar felt that he was one with his tenants and could not justify his existence if they were suffering, so his first thought was to meet their wants and remove their disabilities. But now that we look to a foreign source for everything, this love for our countrymen, this habit of mutual assistance, this sense of mutual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> has disappeared. Each man is for himself and if anything is to be done for our brothers, there is the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> to do it and it is no concern of ours. This drying up of the springs of mutual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>affection</span> is the cause which needs most to be removed and the village Samiti is again the first condition of a better state of things. It will destroy the aloofness, the separateness of our<span class='page-number' id='s-1050' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1050]</span> lives and bring us back the sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, the habit of mutual assistance and mutual beneficence. It will take up the want of water and remove it. It will introduce arbitration courts and, by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>healing</span> our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>family</span> feuds and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> discords, restore the lost sense of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brotherhood</span>. It will seek out the sick and give them medical relief. It will meet the want of an organization for famine relief. It will give justice, it will give protection and when all are thus working for the good of all, the old unity of our lives will be restored, the basis of Swaraj will have been laid in the tie which binds together the hearts of our people.\n\nThis is therefore no empty resolution, it is the practice of Swaraj to which you are vowing yourselves. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> is the leader of Indian regeneration, in Bengal its problems must be worked out and all Bengal is agreed in thisâ€”whatever division there may be among usâ€”that the recovery of our self-dependent national life is the aim and end of our national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>. If you are really lovers of Swaraj, if you are not merely swayed by a blind feeling, a cry, but are prepared to work out Swaraj, then the measure of your sincerity shall be judged by the extent to which you carry out this resolution.

If by this time next year you have not practically given effect to it, we shall understand that your desire for Swaraj is a thing not of the heart but of the lips or of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> at most. But if by that time Mymensingh is covered with village Samitis in full action, then we shall know that one district at least in Bengal has realised the conditions of Swaraj and when one district has solved the problem, it is only a question of time when over all Bengal and over all India, Swaraj will be realised.<span class='page-number' id='s-1051' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1051]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/palli-samiti","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Future and the Nationalists","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-future-and-the-nationalists","prvt":"Conventionalist and Nationalist","prvu":"/cwsa/07/conventionalist-and-nationalist","dt":"1908-04-20","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-future-and-the-nationalists"],"t":"The Future and the Nationalists","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"Whatever view we take of the present situation, the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span> of every Nationalist is to take care that the great principles of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> are not infringed by any concession to the party of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> and self-interest which would imperil the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span>. <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>All</span> the articles we have written on the Convention have been the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> of a momentary policy dictated by the great and almost universal desire in the country that a split should be avoided. But we should never forget that policy is subordinate to principle. As a democratic party, it is our duty to bow to the will of the majority in all matters which do not break the mould of Nationalism to serve the interests of a moment.

No <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> can deny that the differences of opinion which have arisen among us are largely responsible for the extraordinary political activity which has kept <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> astir for the last two years and set the whole world looking towards the banks of the Ganges in eager expectation of a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> among the nations. On the other hand the activity itself has emphasized and increased the differences of opinion both between the parties and in the parties<span class='page-number' id='s-1052' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1052]</span> themselves. The only thing we have to see to is that this diversity is not allowed to break up the nation into warring factions, and we are therefore anxious to save, if possible, the Congress from extinction, because the Congress at present is the only ground of unity in diversity, the only field where all can meet to diverge and again meet without loss of principle or violence to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span>. It is a centre into which the different streams of thought and activity in the country can flow and mix with each other, to again separate and work in their own channels till the time to meet and intercommunicate again arrives. The Congress, therefore, provides the point of unity which prevents the diversity of our political activities from dissolving our political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> into so many disconnected units.\n\nUnity, as we have said, is a means and not an end. To agree is easy if we are willing to sacrifice our principles, but such agreement is not unity; it is sacrificing the soul of the nation so that an artificial appearance of unanimity may be preserved. No unity can be desirable which is inconsistent with growth or with the march of the people towards the realization of their great destiny. Growth is the object, unity only one of the means, and if the means can only be had on condition of sacrificing the object, the means and not the object must be sacrificed. If the Convention refuses to associate with the Nationalists except on condition of the latter sacrificing their principles and stultifying their intellectual convictions, the demand for unity can no longer be pressed on the Nationalist party, which will then be free to take its own course without reference to anything but its own principles and the exigencies of its propaganda. We have done our best to carry out the demand of the people for unity; the refusal comes from the other side and there the responsibility will rest. If the country <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>desires</span> unity, it is for the country to enforce it by refusing to countenance a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> claiming to be the Congress and yet taking its stand on the negation of unity. The Nationalists cannot sit as beggars at the doors of the Convention waiting till the doors be opened to them. They are the builders of Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span>, the inheritors of the future, and their work calls them. If the Convention wants at any time in the near<span class='page-number' id='s-1053' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1053]</span> future to retrace its steps and become one with the Nationalists, it knows the conditions, but time will increase the difficulty of reunion and the conditions will change as the sacrifices made by the Nationalists for the sake of their cause become greater and their work advances. It is time for us to turn from the attempt to patch up matters with men who are pledged to disruption and concern ourselves with our own proper work.\n\nThat work is too heavy for us already, and it will become still more difficult under the new circumstances with an enemy in the house as well as an enemy outside. If we are to face the task with any hope of success, it must be with a much stricter organisation, a general closing up of our ranks and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>creation</span> of instruments for united work and mutual cooperation. We have hitherto been able to work in a scattered and desultory fashion because we were able to use the Congress organisations brought into <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> by the demand for practical work and to take part in and give our stamp to existing bodies. The Convention's new District <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Associations</span> will consist only of men pledged to the creed. Wherever an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Association</span> refuses to be bound by the creed, it will be excluded from the Conventionalist Congress and regarded as a Nationalist body. Under these circumstances the country's demand for unity will become impossible of fulfilment and rival organizations will spring into existence in every province and every district, one pledged to association with the bureaucracy, the other to boycott and self-help. If these bodies admit both parties, they will stand apart from any existing organization. Such a state of things can only be temporary, but it is for a time inevitable if the Convention constitution is carried out. The Nationalists are bound to protect themselves from the attempt to exclude them from political life by organizing themselves in such a way that they may become a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span> in the country which neither bureaucrats nor Loyalists can either ignore or think it an easy task to crush. Organization, therefore, will be the first difficulty to overcome. When once we have succeeded in organizing our at present scattered <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, the spirit of progress once awake will work for us and through us <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> us greater and greater following and strength till the<span class='page-number' id='s-1054' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1054]</span> work of building up the nation becomes so evidently ours that the whole country will range itself under our standard.

The day of compromises is past. Frank, clear and unmistakable let the great issue stand for the country to decide as between the lovers of freedom and the lovers of servitude, between the men who palter with the demand of the Mother for whole-hearted service and those who have given <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> to her, between the politicians and the martyrs, between the advocates of a contradiction and the preachers of the unadorned Truth.

Whichever appeals to its heart and its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>, the country will choose. Of the Conventionalists let us speak no farther.

Before the world is much older, they will see the fruits of their work and rejoice over them if they can.\n\nFor Nationalism a new era begins with the 19th of April 1908. The sharp <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>division</span> that it has created between the two parties will bring the strength of Nationalism, the sincerity of its followers and the validity of its principles to the fiercest test that any cause can undergo. Only that cause is God-created, entrusted with a mission, sure of victory which can stand by itself in a solitude, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolute</span> and supreme, without visible shield or sword, exposed to all that the powers of the world can do to slay it, and yet survive.

Every religion therefore has to begin with a period of persecution. The religion of Nationalism is already far on in this period and the retreat of the Conventionalists from the field of battle, their distinct repudiation of the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> and its works, is the first fruit of the persecution. So much chaff has been sifted from the wheat, so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> stones have been rejected by the great Builder from His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> for the house He is building for our Mother. As time goes on, the test will be fiercer, the sifting more violent and the heavier part of the chaff, if any remains, will follow the lighter. Only the heart that is free from fear, the spirit that is full of faith, the soul that is passionate for realization will remain for the final test and the last purification. To men of doubtful views and undecided <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>opinions</span> the crisis precipitated by the decision of the Convention Committee will prove a cruel embarrassment. To all who have an emotional preference for the new ideas without a clear understanding of their supreme and urgent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>necessity</span>, to all who understand the new ideas with their intellects only but have them not in their hearts, to all who, while loving and understanding the new ideas, have not faith to put aside the cloaks of prudence and dissimulation or courage to avow their faith openly before the world, the position is one of great perplexity. God is a hard master and will not be served by halves. All evasions, all subterfuges He cuts away and puts the question plain and loud; and before all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>, before the friend ready to cut the ties of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>friendship</span> asunder, before the enemy standing ready with lifted sword to slay the servants of God as soon as they confess their faith, it has to be answered: \"Who is on the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Lord</span>'s side?\" Not once, not twice, but always that question is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> put and the answer exacted. If you are unwilling to answer, either you do not believe that it is God's work you are doing and are therefore unfit for it, or you have insufficient faith in His power to get His work done without the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> of your diplomacy and cunning, or you are unwilling<span class='page-number' id='s-1058' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1058]</span> to meet any plain risks in His service.

The waverer must make up his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> either to answer God's question or to give up the work. There is plenty for him to do in a cheap, safe and easy way if he cannot face the risks of self-devotion. He can hold Conferences, enrol himself as a member of the Convention's District <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Associations</span>, open funds for national purposes, pass resolutions, sign petitions, hold patriotic interviews with Magistrates, Commissioners, Lieutenant-Governors, Governors and even perhaps with a live Viceroy; he can, if he is a barrister, plead in Swadeshi cases; he can take shares in profitable Swadeshi investments and boast himself a great Swadeshi worker, a captain of industry, a solid patriot; he can do real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> to the country without peril to himself by subscribing to help National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>. In these and other ways he can satisfy his secret proclivities for the service of his country. But the days when this easy service could pass for Nationalism are numbered.\n\nThe work now before us is of the sternest kind and requires men of an unflinching sternness to carry it out. The hero, the martyr, the man of iron will and iron heart, the grim fighter whose tough <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nerves</span> defeat cannot tire out nor danger relax, the born leader in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span>, the man who cannot sleep or rest while his country is enslaved, the priest of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kali</span> who can tear his heart out of his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> and offer it as a bleeding sacrifice on the Mother's altar, the heart of fire and the tongue of flame whose lightest word is an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span> to self-sacrifice or a spur to action, for these the time is coming, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> will soon go forth. They are already here in the silence, in the darkness slowly maturing themselves, training the muscles of the will, tightening the strings of the heart so that they may be ready when the call comes. Whoever feels the power of service within him, let him make sure of himself while there is yet time; for the present is an hour of easy probation, of light tests in which the punishment of failure is also light, but whoever fails in the day that be coming, will be thrown away not<span class='page-number' id='s-1059' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1059]</span> into the rubbish heap as the Conventionalists will be thrown, but into the fire of a great burning. For all who now declare themselves Nationalists the tests will be far severer than that before which the place-hunter, the title-hunter, the popularity-hunter, the politician of mixed motives and crooked ways, the trimmer, the light speaker and ready swearer of the old politics have paled and recoiled so early and so easily. The profession of Nationalism should not be lightly made but with a full sense of what it means and involves. The privilege of taking it is attended with severe pains and penalties for those who take it lightly. If we are few, it matters little, but it is of supreme importance that the stuff of which we are made should be sound. What the Mother needs is hard clear steel for her sword, hard massive granite for her fortress, wood that will not break for the handle of her bow, tough substance and true for the axle of her chariot.

When the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span> is stirred and feelings become sincere and acute, parties arise, each passionate for its opinions, eager to carry them out, full of enthusiasm for an imagined ideal. The air becomes vibrant with <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, the full blast of hope and endeavour fills the sails of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> and through<span class='page-number' id='s-1061' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1061]</span> a sea sometimes stormy and never quite placid the ship of a nation's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> plunges forward to its destination. A political life in which there are no parties is political stagnation, death-in-life. It means that the intellect of the nation is torpid, its feelings feeble and flaccid, its aspirations untouched with passion of sincerity, fervour of hope unawakened, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> of the country an inoperative sentiment confined to the intellect only and not yet close to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>. The patriot is consumed with the passion to serve his country, to make her great, free or splendid. His <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>brain</span> is full of plans for the fulfilment of his hopes and he seeks helpers and followers to bring it about, while he tries to disabuse the country of ideas which he believes injurious to his plans. A <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> planning the republican freedom of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> creates the party of New Italy, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Garibaldi</span> filled with the same hope but bent on freedom first and republicanism afterwards <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> his Legion of Red Shirts and holds the balance of parties, a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Cavour</span> full of grandiose schemes of a Kingdom of Italy leads the old monarchical sentiment of Piedmont and all that gathers round it. These parties <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> and distrust each other, but all have one clear and unmistakable purpose, the freedom of Italy, and work for it, each doing something towards the common end which the others could not have done. Thus the purpose of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> works itself out and not the purpose of Mazzini, or the purpose of Garibaldi, or the purpose of Cavour. Parties are necessary but they must have a common end overriding their specific differences, the freedom, greatness and splendour of their motherland. Only one party is inexcusable, inadmissible, not to be parleyed with, the party which is against freedom, the party which seeks to perpetuate national slavery.\n\nIn <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> today there are in appearance two parties at issue over the destiny of the country. One puts Swaraj as its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>goal</span>, the other a modified freedom under the supreme control of a paramount and protecting Britain. Men of both parties try to show that their party is that of the true patriots, the other a faction fatal to the best interests of the country; both claim the lead of the country, the true right to be the representatives of its feelings and in possession of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>. If they were equally<span class='page-number' id='s-1062' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1062]</span> patriotic, this opposition would work for the good of the country and not for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span>. If both were equally bent on the freedom of their country, they would supply each other's deficiencies, do each what the other is unfit to do and by their mutual rivalry work out the salvation of their country. The Moderate party contains a certain number of men who are really patriotic and desire the freedom of their country, whatever they may think it prudent to profess in public. If these men formed the whole or the bulk of their party, the present strife of parties would be an unmixed blessing, but unfortunately for the country there is a large and powerful element which is of a very different stamp. The representatives of this clique are the true movers of the Convention and their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> are hardly disguised. They do not believe in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span> of their people for self-government or in the desirability of freedom for India and, if they subscribe to the formula of self-government, it is avowedly as a distant millennium which is to be kept outside the pale of practical politics. Their political aims are bounded by such changes in the existing system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span> as will give them and their class a greater share in the bureaucratic administration and a safe, easy and profitable road to position, popularity and honours. Patriotism is with them no ideal, no overmastering passion, no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>, but an instrument for advancing certain interests and gaining certain advantages. These men are Loyalists of a baser type, who desire the continuance of the British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span> out of self-interest and not from any love of it or conviction of its goodness and utility. It is these men who have brought about the Surat fiasco, the Convention, the creed and the Allahabad constitution, and the Surendranaths and Gokhales have been tools in their hands. Conventionalism is a factor in our politics which makes for reaction, a revolt against the new ideas and a direct negation of our future. As such it will serve the ends of bureaucracy, tighten the chain and militate against progress; it can never be a factor helping towards our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span>. If the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> Moderates cling to the Convention they too will be no longer a factor in the work of liberation but an enemy and an obstacle like the Italian Moderates who clung to the Austrian<span class='page-number' id='s-1063' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1063]</span> domination as necessary to Italy. They are forfeiting their future when they deny the future of their country. If parties are to arise henceforth it must be among those who are the advocates of freedom and workers for freedom, for they alone can differ without faction and work together for a common end on different lines. Those who make the negation of the country's future the test of admission to their counsels, will themselves be excluded from the counsels of the Power that is shaping that future. Without them, for they are too feeble to be reckoned as an opposing <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, that which they deny will accomplish itself.<span class='page-number' id='s-1064' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1064]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/party-and-the-country","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"The Bengalee Facing Both Ways","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/the-bengalee-facing-both-ways","prvt":"The Wheat and the Chaff","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-wheat-and-the-chaff","dt":"1908-04-24","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["the-bengalee-facing-both-ways"],"t":"The Bengalee Facing Both Ways","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"We confess we cannot understand the position taken up by the *Bengalee* in the paragraph we quote on another page.

The *Bengalee*, however, talks of reconciliation and the Convention in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> breath. It trusts that the path of reconciliation is not yet definitely closed, although the Convention to which Srijut Surendranath belongs has definitely enough adopted an exclusion clause and is going to summon a new-born Congress of its own. It is even bold enough to say that the resolution of the Convention does not preclude reconciliation. We find it difficult to command words which will properly characterize the audacity of this assertion. Does the *Bengalee* imagine that the Nationalists are going to accept a Congress called by the Convention, a Constitution framed by a handful of gentlemen meeting at Allahabad and a creed or \"statement of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>\" which contradict their fundamental<span class='page-number' id='s-1064' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1064]</span> principles?

She has suffused them with her peculiar individuality so completely that their foreign origin is no longer recognizable.

But at the time when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span> forced itself upon her, her political life was at its nadir.

She allowed it to enter her being whole and undigested. The result was a rapid disintegration of her own individuality and a hastening of the process of decay which had set in as a result of the prolonged anarchy of the post-Mogul period. If there had been no reaction, the process would have been soon over and, whatever race finally occupied India, it would not have been the Indian race. For that race would have slowly perished as the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Greek</span>, when he parted with the springs of his life, perished and gave way to the Slav, or as the Egyptian perished and gave way to the Berber. This <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> has been averted, because a great wave of reaction passed over the country and sent a stream of the old life and thought of India beating into the veins of the country and brought it to bear on the foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> which was eating up the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of the nation. That process of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>assimilation</span> has just begun and its effects will not be palpable for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> years to come. It will first effect its purpose on the political life of the people, then on its society, last on its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>, thought and speech. The effect on the political life is already visible, but it cannot fulfil itself until the political power is in the hands of the people. No political change can work itself out until the forces of change have taken possession of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span>, because it is through the government that the functions of political life work. This is their organ and there can be no other. The possession of the Government by the people is therefore the first condition of Indian regeneration. Until this is attained, nothing else can be attained. The new forces will no doubt work quietly on society and on literature, but in an imperfect fashion from which no great results can be anticipated.\n\nSociety lives by the proper <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of its parts and bases that harmony on the centre of power in which the whole <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span> is summed up, the State.

It was for this reason that <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mazzini</span> whose natural tendencies were literary and poetic, turned away from literature and denied his abilities their natural <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>expression</span> with the memorable words, \"The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>art</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Italy</span> will flourish on our graves.\" No great work can be done by a community which is diseased at the centre or deprived of a centre. The hope of social reform divorced from political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, unless by social reform we mean the aping of European <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of life and social ideas, is an illogical hope which ignores the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of social life and the conditions of its well-being. All expectation of moral regeneration which leaves freedom out of the count is a dream. First freedom, then regeneration. This is a truism which we have been obliged to dwell on because there are still remnants of the first delusive teachings which have done so much harm to India by trying to realise social reform without providing the element in which alone any reform is possible.\n\nTo recover possession of the State is therefore the first <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> of the awakened Indian consciousness. If this is so, then it is obvious that the political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>liberation</span> of India cannot be put off to a distant date as a thing which can be worked out at leisure, with the slow pace of the snail, by creeping degrees of senile caution. It must be done now. It is the first condition of life which must be satisfied if the nation is to survive. On this the whole energies of the people must be concentrated and no other will-o'-the-wisp of social reform, moral regeneration, educational improvement ought to be allowed to interfere with the stupendous, single-souled <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> which can alone effect the political salvation of the country. No reasonable reformer ought to be put out by the demand for the precedence being given to political salvation, because it is obvious that the political resurgence of the nation involves and necessitates a regeneration of the society by the great change of spirit and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>environment</span> which it will bring about. When the whole life of the nation is full of the spirit of freedom and it lives in the great life of the world, then only can the work of the reformer be successful. The preoccupation with politics which seized <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span> after the Partition was a healthy symptom. Recently there has been a tendency in some quarters<span class='page-number' id='s-1068' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1068]</span> to revive the old dissipation of energies, to put social reform first, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>education</span> first or moral regeneration first, and leave freedom to result from these. The mistake should be checked before it gains ground. Whatever reform, social, moral or educational, is necessary to bring about freedom, the effort of the whole people to bring about freedom will automatically effect. More is impossible until freedom itself is attained. No attempt to effect social reform for its own sake has any <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of success, because it will at once reawaken the old bitter struggle between the past and the present which baffled the efforts of the reformers.

There is a general shrinking from the full danger of the struggle, a wish to try by how few sacrifices the work can be accomplished and at how cheap a cost the priceless boon of liberty can be purchased. This reluctance to enter on the real struggle was a necessary and salutary stage of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span>, because the nation, after the long pauperisation of its energies and enervation of its character by a hundred years of dependence and mendicancy, would have been unequal to the sacrifices the real struggle demands.

Great issues were involved in that historic struggle at Surat of which none of the<span class='page-number' id='s-1071' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1071]</span> actors were aware. Only posterity looking back with awe on the sequel, will date the commencement of the real world-shaking earthquake from that slight ruffling of the untroubled surface of the soil. The forces that sent that slight quiver of the earth to the surface are hidden as yet from the eye of contemporary politics or only dimly guessed by a few, but within a brief period they will have declared themselves to the amazement of those who thought that they were only playing a clever tactical game with the lifeless figures of a puppet show. The grim forces that have been moving under the surface will now find the field open to them by the shattering of the keystone of the old political edifice. The efforts of the two parties to replace the Congress by new bodies of a party character are not likely to prosper, for the Moderate Convention will fade into nothingness by its inherent want of vitality, while the Congress of the Nationalists, whatever its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span>, will not be the old Congress but a new and incalculable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>force</span>, the product of a revolution and perhaps its plaything. The disappearance of the old Congress announces the end of the preparatory stage of the movement, the beginning of a clash of forces whose first full shock will produce chaos. The fair hopes of an orderly and peaceful <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span> of self-government, which the first energies of the new movement had fostered, are gone for ever.

There was no fight at <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> over the question of creed or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span>, and indeed the difference of name is so trivial that the<span class='page-number' id='s-1072' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1072]</span> legend of this stout fight over a shadow has little verisimilitude. About the question of the subscription to the creed the only difference between the Bengal-Punjab party and the Bombay-United Provinces party was whether it should be obligatory to sign the creed or sufficient to swear verbally to it. *That the clause should be binding and express acceptance obligatory as a condition of admission to the Congress, both parties were agreed*. What becomes then of the story of Surendranath's gallant battle for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span> of election and freedom of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conscience</span> in the Congress? It seems that the whole Committee was solid for exclusion. The other point of difference was whether there should be a new Congress called by the Convention or the adjourned Congress resummoned by Dr. Rash Behari <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Ghose</span>. As this adjourned Congress would in any case be saddled with the creed and the Convention constitution, it would be in effect a new Congress. This subject of quarrel, too, like the others, turns out to be a distinction without a difference. According to the *Advocate*, then, Surendranath's party and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mehta</span> party were in entire agreement, only the Bengal members wanted to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> the same things by other <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>names</span>. Not a creed but a statement of objects binding on every delegate; not a written subscription but a verbal oath of allegiance; not a new Congress without the Nationalists, but the old Congress without the Nationalists. If we are to believe the *Advocate*, the Bengal Moderates only succeeded in showing themselves consummate hypocrites and fencers with words. If this account be a libel on them, it should, we think, be authoritatively contradicted. Otherwise the public will form their own conclusions.<span class='page-number' id='s-1073' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1073]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/whom-to-believe","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"By the Way - The Parable of Sati","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-the-parable-of-sati","prvt":"New Conditions","prvu":"/cwsa/07/new-conditions","dt":"1908-04-29","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["by-the-way-the-parable-of-sati"],"t":"By the Way - The Parable of Sati","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Daksha</span>, the great Prajapati, had a daughter, named Sati, whom he loved <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>beyond</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> his children, and the Rishis wedded her to<span class='page-number' id='s-1073' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1073]</span> Mahadeva, the great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>lord</span> of the Universe.

His scorn increased the more he came to know of his son-in-law, a bhang-eating lazy ne'er-do-well with no ascertainable means of livelihood, no home, no property, no degree or other educational qualification, no stake in the world. He cursed the Rishis for fools and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> counsellors, visionaries who saw in this pauper with his bowl and his matted hair the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of the World. So when he had to offer a great sacrifice, he sent invitations to all the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Gods</span>, but deliberately excluded his son-in-law. The result was disastrous. Sati, full of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grief</span> and indignation at the affront to her lord, gave up her body and disappeared from mortal ken. Then came Mahadeva in his wrath, the mighty <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>One</span>, the destroyer of Universes, and broke Daksha's sacrifice to pieces and shattered the hall of sacrifice and slew Daksha in his hall.\n\n---\n\nThere was a Daksha too in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> which was called the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian National Congress</span>. Like Daksha it was a great figure, a Prajapati with numerous offspring, full of dignity, sobriety, wisdom, and much esteemed by the gods. This Daksha too had a daughter whom he loved, the young Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nation</span>. When the time for her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>marriage</span> came, she chose for herself the bridegroom offered to her by the Rishis who declared him to be Mahadeva, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Destiny</span> of India and her fated Lord. It was at sacred Benares that she first saw Mahadeva face to face and betrothed herself to him, but the marriage took place at Calcutta with a fourfold mantra, Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott, National <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Education</span>, as the sacred formula of union. The marriage did not please Daksha, but the Rishis were importunate and Sati firm, so he was compelled to give way. He cursed the Rishis freely. \"What manner of husband is this they have given to my Sati? A homeless beggar, wild and half crazy with the bhang he has drunk, wandering on the hills in<span class='page-number' id='s-1074' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1074]</span> company with the wild beasts and the demons, without culture, enlightenment and education, rude in speech, rough in manners, ill-clad, destitute, with no past, no present and no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>! Yet these fanatics <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> him the Master of the World, an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>embodiment</span> of the Almighty, and what not!\" So he hid his grief and wrath but determined to be revenged. For Mahadeva the Mighty, the Destiny of India, had long wandered in the wilderness with a beggar's bowl in his hand, poor and destitute, an ascetic smeared with ashes and clad in a tiger's skin, with no home in which he could lay down his head. And when he came to the marriage, it was in fearsome guise and in evil company, drunk with the bhang of a wild <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>, shouting \"Bombom Bande Mataram\" at the top of his mighty voice, disreputable in appearance and unfit to associate with polite and cultured gentlemen such as Daksha had hitherto made his friends, poor, shaggy, ill-clad, with no visible means of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and no tangible prospects in the future; and his companions were a wild company of *lathi*-bearing National Volunteers and other disquieting phantasms quite out of place in Daksha's tastefully got-up and elegant marriage pandal. How could Daksha realize that in this uncouth figure was the Destroyer and Creator of an Universe, One who held the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of India and of the world in his hands? The Rishis only knew it and they were called visionaries and fanatics for their pains.\n\n---\n\nDaksha prepared a great annual sacrifice in the year after the marriage and held it with much pomp, but he determined to exclude Mahadeva the Mighty from the sacrifice and so framed the rules of admission that the undesirable son-in-law might keep away in future. The result is known to everybody. The Destiny of India, whom Daksha tried to exclude, came in wrath and knocked at the gates of the hall of sacrifice and when Daksha's hired men tried to beat him back, he broke into the hall and shattered the sacrifice and slew Daksha in his hall.<span class='page-number' id='s-1075' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1075]</span>\n\n---\n\nThe story goes that Mahadeva, entreated on behalf of Daksha, restored him to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span>, but when the head of Daksha was sought for it could not be found, and so a goat's head was incontinently clapped on the unfortunate Prajapati's shoulders. When the modern Daksha died, there was a similar desire to revive him but the head could not be found. Some said it was lost, others argued in more legal language that it was *functus officio*. Accordingly these wise men found a goat's head which they called a creed and stuck it on the shoulders of Daksha and put life into his trunk and swore that this goat-headed legless anomaly should in future be called Daksha. Unfortunately they made the whole thing more grotesque by clapping on the goat's head the wrong way, so that its face was turned backward and, when the crippled monster tried to shove itself along, its progress was retrogression and its advance a retreat. For its eyes were turned to the past and not to the future.\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile, Mahadeva the Mighty wandered over the world carrying the dead body of Sati on his head, dancing a wild <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dance</span> of ruin which shook the world to its foundations. For Sati had left her old body and men said she was dead. But she was not dead, only withdrawn from the eyes of men, and the Gods clove the body of Sati into pieces so that it was scattered all over India. Which thing is also a parable; for after the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>death</span> of the Congress the unity of India, which was the daughter of the Congress, must break up into factions and groups. The Convention is already developing parties and in the wild times that are coming the Nationalists also will break up into parties, some of which will make the present designation of extremism as applied to us look an absurdity, and the political life of India will become an anarchy. But not for ever.

When the Convention was first held at Surat, many of the Nationalist delegates from Maharashtra saw no objection to signing the creed as it stood, and some of them went to the Pandal and offered to sign but were turned away. It was because the Bengal delegates refused to sign that the party as a whole did not appear at the Pandal to resume the struggle for progress. The position taken up by Mr. Tilak and the Mahrattas has not altered. They object to binding down the future by a creed, but they would not object to signing a statement putting self-government within the Empire as an immediate object if such signature be necessary for unity; they refuse however to associate themselves with any creed, clause or subscription which would have the result of excluding a large section of the Progressive party. There are and always will be minor differences of opinion among the Nationalists, but they are united on three cardinal principles: 1) That nothing short of absolute autonomy can permanently satisfy Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span>; 2) That prayer, petition and protest can never be an effective method of political agitation; 3) That passive resistance and self-help can alone advance the country at the present stage.<span class='page-number' id='s-1085' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1085]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/nationalist-differences","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Bande Mataram under the Editorship of Sri Aurobindo with Speeches Delivered during the Same Period"}],"nxtt":"Ideals Face to Face","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/ideals-face-to-face","prvt":"By the Way","prvu":"/cwsa/07/by-the-way-2","dt":"1908-05-02","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["ideals-face-to-face"],"t":"Ideals Face to Face","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"A new ordeal always brings with it a new awakening.

The future success of the Nationalist party depends on the boldness with which it takes up the real point at issue and affirms its beliefs.

Swaraj as the fulfilment of the ancient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of India under modern conditions, the return of the Satyayuga of national greatness, the resumption by her of her great role of teacher and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span>, self-liberation of the people for the final fulfilment of the Vedantic ideal in politics, this is the true Swaraj for India. Of all the proud nations of the West there is an end determined. When their limited special work for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span> is done they must decay and disappear. But the function of India is to supply the world with a perennial source of light and renovation. Whenever the first play of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> is exhausted and earth grows old and weary, full of materialism, racked with problems she cannot solve, the function of India is to restore the youth of mankind and assure it of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>. She sends forth a light from her bosom which floods the earth and the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heavens</span>, and mankind bathes in it like St. George in the well of life and recovers strength, hope and vitality for its long pilgrimage. Such a time is now at hand. The world needs India and needs her free. The work she has to do now is to organize life in the terms of Vedanta, and that is a work she cannot do while overshadowed by a foreign power and a foreign <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. She cannot do it without taking the management of her own life into her own hands. She must live her own life and not the life of a part or subordinate in a foreign Empire.\n\nAll political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> must have relation to the temperament and past <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>history</span> of the race. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> of India is separate from that of any other race in the world, and perhaps there is no<span class='page-number' id='s-1086' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1086]</span> race in the world whose temperament, culture and ideals are so foreign to her own as those of the practical, hard-headed, Pharisaic, shop-keeping <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Anglo-Saxon</span>. The culture of the Anglo-Saxon is the very antipodes of Indian culture. The temper of the Anglo-Saxon is the very reverse of the Indian temper. His ideals are of the earth, earthy. His institutions are without warmth, sympathy, human feeling, rigid and accurate like his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span>, meant for immediate and practical gains. The reading of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> which he has adopted and is trying to introduce first in the colonies because <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>the mother</span> country is still too much shackled by the past, is the most sordid possible, centred on <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>material</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aims</span> and void of generous idealism. In such a civilisation, as part of such an Empire, India can have no future. If she is to model herself on the Anglo-Saxon type she must first kill everything in her which is her own. If she is to be a province of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>British Empire</span>, part of its life, sharing its institutions, governed by its policy, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fate</span> of Greece under Roman dominion will surely be hers. She may share the privileges and obligations of British citizenship,â€”though the proud Briton who excludes the Indian from his colonies and treats him as a lower creature, will perish rather than concede such an equality,â€”but she will lose her Indian birthright. She will have to pass a sponge over her past and obliterate it from her life, even if she preserves the empty records of it in her schools. The degradation of a great nation, by the loss of her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individuality</span>, her past and her independent future, to the position of a subordinate satellite in a foreign system, is the ideal of the Convention. It is sheer political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>atheism</span>, the negation of all that we were, are and hope to be. The return of India on her <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> self, the restoration of her splendour, greatness, triumphant Asiatic supremacy is the ideal of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span>. Is it doubtful which ideal will be more acceptable to the nation, that which calls on it to murder its <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instincts</span>, sacrifice its future and deny its past for the advantage of an inglorious security, or that which asks it to fulfil itself by the strenuous reassertion of all that is noble and puissant in the blood it draws from such an heroic ancestry as no other nation can boast?\n\nThe ideal creates the means of attaining the ideal, if it is<span class='page-number' id='s-1087' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1087]</span> itself true and rooted in the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>destiny</span> of the race. All that can be said for the Convention's ideal is that it saves the professor of the ideal from the wrath of the bureaucracy. Otherwise it is as grotesquely out of proportion to the strength of the people who profess it as any which the Nationalist can uphold. It has no exciting virtue of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>divine</span> enthusiasm which can inspire to heroic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> and enable a fallen nation to shake off its weakness, turn cowards into heroes and selfish men into self-denying martyrs of the cause, and yet the effort it demands for realisation is as heroic as anything which the Nationalist expects from the people. The pride of race, the pride of empire, the pride of colour are the three invincible barriers which stand between it and its realisation. What force have the Conventionalists to set against these? Tears and supplications, appeals to British <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span> and British generosityâ€”nothing else. They are not serious in their ideal and do not really hold it but flaunt it as a counterpoise to the Nationalist ideal so that the country may be deceived into thinking they have an aim and a policy. They have none. A false ideal is always a veil for something else, and the Convention creed is with some a veil for secret hopes of liberty which they dare not avow and with others a veil for the absence of any aim except the hope of securing a few peddling reforms in the existing system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>administration</span>.\n\nThe future is with the Nationalist ideal because there is no other. But the danger is that the false shadow of an ideal which is now <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> put forward as a reality will be accepted as a convenient <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> for self-protection against the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>anger</span> of the bureaucracy. The temptation it holds out is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> to which all new faiths are exposed, that which was the chief danger of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christianity</span> in the days of persecution, to which, for a fleeting moment, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomed</span> is said to have succumbed when harassed by the Koraish, the temptation of securing a respite from persecution by a false profession which, masking itself as a harmless piece of diplomacy, will really be a fatal stab at the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> of the new religion.

It is commonly said that this is because Japan has assimilated Western Science and organization and even in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> respects excelled its teachers; India has failed in this all-important task of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>assimilation</span>. If we go a step farther back and insist on asking why this is so, we shall be told it is because Japan has \"reformed\" herself and got rid of ideas & institutions unsuited to modern times; while India clings obstinately to so much that is outworn and effete. Even if we waive aside the question whether the old Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ideals</span> are unfit to survive or whether <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> our institutions are really bad in themselves or unadaptable to modern conditions, still the explanation itself has to be explained. Why has Japan so admirably transformed herself? why has the attempt at transformation in India been a failure? The solution of problems of this kind has to be sought not in abstractions, not in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>machinery</span>, but in men.

In Japan the dominant <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Japanese</span> type had been moulded by the shaping processes of an admirable culture and when the Western impact came, Japan remained faithful to her ancient spirit; she merely took over certain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of European social & political organization necessary to complete her culture under modern conditions and poured into these forms the old potent dynamic spirit of Japan, the spirit of the Samurai. It is the Samurai type which has been dominant in that country during the nineteenth century. In India the mass of the nation has remained dormant; European culture has had upon it a powerful disintegrating and destructive influence, but has been powerless to reconstruct or revivify. But in the upper strata a new type has been evolved to serve the necessities and interests of the foreign rulers, a type which is not Indian, but foreignâ€”and in almost all our social, political, educational, literary & religious activities the spirit of this new & foreign graft has predominated & determined the extent & quality of our progress. This type is the bourgeois. In India, the bourgeois, in Japan, the Samurai; in this single difference is comprised the whole contrasted histories of the two nations during the nineteenth century.\n\nWhat is the bourgeois? For the word is unknown in India, though the thing is so prominent. The bourgeois is the average contented middle class citizen who is in all countries much the same in his fundamental character & <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>habits</span> of thought, in spite of pronounced racial differences in temperament & self-expression. He is a man of facile sentiments and skin-deep personality; generally \"enlightened\" but not inconveniently illuminated. In <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>love</span> with his life, his ease and above all things his comforts, he prescribes the secure maintenance of these precious possessions as the first indispensable condition of all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> in politics and society; whatever tends to disturb or destroy them, he condemns as foolish, harebrained, dangerous or fanatical, according to the degree of its intensity and is ready to repress by any means in his power. In the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>conduct</span> of public<span class='page-number' id='s-1092' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1092]</span> movements he has an exaggerated worship for external <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, moderation and decorum and hates over-earnestness and over-strenuousness. Not that he <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>objects</span> to plenty of mild & innocuous excitement; but it must be innocuous and calculated not to have a disturbing effect on the things he most cherishes. He has ideals and likes to talk of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>justice</span>, liberty, reform, enlightenment and all similar abstractions; he likes too to see them reigning and progressing around him decorously and with their proper limitations. He wishes to have them maintained, if they already exist, but in moderation and with moderation; if they do not exist, the craving for them should be, in his opinion, a lively but still well-regulated fire, not permitted to interfere with the safety, comfort and decorum of life,â€”the means adopted towards acquiring them should be also moderate and decorous and as far as may be safe and comfortable. An occasional sacrifice of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span>, leisure and other precious things for their sake, he is always ready to meet; he has a keen zest for the reputation such sacrifices bring him and still more for the comfortable sense of personal righteousness which they foster. The bourgeois is the man of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> sense and enlightenment, the man of moderation, the man of peace and orderliness, the man in every way \"respectable\", who is the mainstay of all well-ordered societies. As a private man he is respectable; that is to say, his character is generally good, and when his character is not, his reputation is; he is all decorous in his virtues, decent in the indulgence of his vices or at least in their concealment, often absolutely honest, almost always as honest as an enlightened self-interest will permit. His purse is well filled or at any rate not indecently empty; he is a good earner, a conscientious worker, a thoroughly safe & reliable citizen.[^1] But this admirable creature has his defects and limitations. For great adventures, tremendous enterprises, lofty achievements, the storm and stress of mighty & eventful periods in national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, he is unfit. These things are for the heroes, the<span class='page-number' id='s-1093' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1093]</span> martyrs, the criminals, the enthusiasts, the degenerates, geniuses, the men of exaggerated virtue, exaggerated ability, exaggerated ideas.

The spirit of ancient India was aristocratic; its thought & life moulded<span class='page-number' id='s-1095' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1095]</span> in the cast of a high & proud nobility, an extreme & lofty strenuousness. The very best in thought, the very best in action, the very best in character, the very best in literature & art, the very best in religion and all the world well lost if only this very best might be attained, such was the spirit of ancient India. The Brahmin who devoted himself to poverty & crushed down every desire in the wholehearted pursuit of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> & religious self-discipline; the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kshatriya</span> who, hurling his life joyously into the shock of chivalrous battle, held life, wife, children, possessions, ease, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>happiness</span> as mere dust in the balance compared with honour & the Kshatriya <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>dharma</span>, the preservation of self-respect, the protection of the weak, the noble fulfilment of princely <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>duty</span>; the Vaishya, who toiling all his life to amass riches, poured them out as soon as amassed in self-forgetting philanthropy holding himself the mere steward & not the possessor of his wealth; the Shudra who gave himself up loyally to humble service, faithfully devoting his life to his dharma, however low, in preference to self-advancement & <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ambition</span>; these were the social ideals of the age.\n\nThe imagination of the Indian tended as has been well said to the grand & enormous in thought and morals. The great formative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>images</span> of legend & literature to the likeness with which his childhood was encouraged to develop & which his manhood most cherished were of an extreme & lofty type. He saw Harischundra give up all that life held precious & dear rather than that his lips should utter a lie or his plighted word be broken. He saw Prahlada buried under mountains, whelmed in the seas, tortured by the poison of a thousand venomous serpents, yet calmly true to his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span>.

The sense-conquering thought of the philosopher, the magnificent achievements of the hero, the stupendous renunciations of the Sannyasin, [the] unbounded liberality of the man of wealth, everything was exaggeration, extreme, filled with an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>epic</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inspiration</span>, a world-defying enthusiasm. The bourgeois though he existed in the rough of course, as in all civilized societies he must exist, had no real <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>chance</span> of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evolution</span>; on such a height with so rare an atmosphere, he could not grow; where such tempests of self-devotion blew habitually, his warm comfortable personality could not expand.\n\nThe conditions of mediaeval India suited him little better,â€”the continual clash of arms, the unceasing stir & splendour & strenuousness of life, the fierceness of the struggle and the magnificence of the achievement, the ceaseless tearing down & building up which resulted from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> irruption and the action & reaction of foreign & indigenous <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forces</span>, formed surroundings too restless & too flamboyant. Life under the Moguls was splendid, rich & luxurious, but it was not safe & comfortable. Magnificent possibilities were open to all men whatever their <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>birth</span> or station but magnificent abilities and an unshaken nerve & courage were needed to grasp them or to keep what had been grasped. There was no demand for the stable & easy virtues of the bourgeois. In the times of stress and anarchy which accompanied the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disintegration</span> of mediaeval India, the conditions were yet more unfavourable; character and morals shared in the general disintegration, but ability & courage were even more in demand than before and for the bourgeois there was no place vacant. (The men who figured in the revolutions in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, the Deccan, the Punjab & the North were often, like their European allies & antagonists, men of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> character, self-seeking, unscrupulous & Machiavellian, but they were at least men.) It was not till mediaeval India breathed its last in the convulsions of 1857 that entirely new conditions reigned and an entirely new culture prevailed with an undisputed sway wholly favourable to the rapid development of the bourgeois type and wholly discouraging to the development of any other.<span class='page-number' id='s-1097' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1097]</span>\n\nThis emergence and domination of the bourgeois was a rapid transformation, not unparalleled in history, for something of the same kind seems to have happened in the provinces of the Roman Empire under the Caesars, but astonishing in a people whose past history & temperament had been so supremely unPhilistine. That a society which had only a few decades ago prostrated itself before the naked <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>ascetic</span> and the penniless Brahmin, should now wear the monied man and the official as the tilak on its forehead, was indeed a marvellous revolution. But given the new conditions, nothing else could have happened. British rule necessitated the growth of the bourgeois, British policy fostered it, and the plant grew so swiftly because a forcing-house had been created for his rapid cultivation and the soil was kept suitably shallow and the air made warm and humid for his needs. It was as in the ancient world when the nations accepted peace, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> and a common language at the cost of national decay, the death of their manhood and final extinction or age-long slavery. The Pax Britannica was his parent and an easy servitude nursed him into maturity.\n\nFor the first need of the bourgeois is a guaranteed and perfect security for his person, property and pursuits. Peace, comfort and safety are the very breath of his nostrils. But he gravitates to a peace for whose preservation he is not called on to wear armour and wield the sword, a comfort he has not to purchase by the discomfort of standing sentinel over his liberties, or a safety his own alertness and courage must protect from the resurgence of old dangers. The bourgeois in arms is not the true animal; the purity of his breed is sullied by something of the virtues and defects of the soldier. He must enjoy the fruits of peace and security he has not earned, without responsibility for their maintenance or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> of their loss. Such conditions he found in almost unparallelled perfection in British India. He was asked to stand as the head of a disarmed and dependent society, secured from external disturbance & tied down to a rigid internal tranquillity by the deprivation of all functions except those of breadwinner and taxpayer and to vouch himself to the world by a respectable but not remarkable education and achievement as<span class='page-number' id='s-1098' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1098]</span> the visible proof of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>England</span>'s civilising mission in India. Such conditions were to the bourgeois as the moisture & warmth of the hothouse to the orchid. He grew in them, rank & luxurious.\n\nThen again, for his perfection and dominance, the society he lives in must honour his peculiar qualities above all others and the substantial rewards and covetable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>distinctions</span> of life [be] reserved for them chiefly or for them alone. The British rule gave him this honour, showered on him these rewards & distinctions, and Indian society, more & more moulded by British ideas, followed as a society almost inevitably follows the lead of the rulers. Under the new dispensation of Providence there was no <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> for the high qualities of old, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Aryan</span> or noble virtues which, whatever else failed or perished, had persisted in Indian character for thousands of years, since first the chariots rolled on the hither-side of the Indus. What need for the Rajpoot's courage, the robust manhood, the noble pride of the Kshatriya, when heroic and unselfish England claimed the right of shedding her blood for the safety of the land? What room for the gifts of large initiative, comprehensive foresight, wise <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aspiration</span> which make the statesman, when a Bentinck or a Mayo, a Dufferin or a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Curzon</span> were ready & eager to take & keep the heavy burdens of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Government</span> out of the hands of the children of the soil? The princely spirit, the eagle's vision, the lion's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span>, these were things that might be buried away with the memories of the great Indian rulers of the past. Happy India, civilised and cared for by human seraphs from over the sea, had no farther need for them. So from sheer inanition, from want of light, room and air, the Kshatriya died out of the soil which had first produced him and the bourgeois took his place. But if room was none for the soldier & the statesman, little could be found for the Brahmin, the sage or the Sannyasin. British rule had no need for scholars, it wanted clerks; British policy welcomed the pedant but feared, even when it honoured, the thinker, for the strong mind might pierce through shows to the truth and the deep thought teach the people to embrace great ideals and live and die for them; British education flung contempt on the Sannyasin as an idler and charlatan, and pointed with admiration to the<span class='page-number' id='s-1099' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1099]</span> strenous seeker for worldly goods and success as the finest work of the creator. So Vyasa & Valmekie were forgotten for weavers of idle tales and Smiles and Sir Arthur Helps took their place as an instructor of youth, the gospel of Philistinism in its naked crudeness was beaten into the minds of our children when most malleable. Thus Ramdas was following Shivaji into the limbo of the unreturning past. And if God had not meant otherwise for our nation, the Sannyasin would have become an extinct type, Yoga been classed among dead superstitions with witchcraft & alchemy and Vedanta sent the way of Pythagoras & Plato. Nor was the old Vaishya type needed by the new dispensation. The Indian mechanician, engineer, architect, artist, craftsman got notice of dismissal; for to develop the industrial life of the country was no part of England's <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>business</span> in India. As she had taken the functions of government and war into her own hands, so she would take that of production. Whatever India needed, beneficent England with her generous system of free trade would supply and the Indian might sit at ease under his palm tree or, gladly singing, till his fields, rejoicing that Heaven had sent him a ruling nation so greedy to do him good. What was wanted was not Indian artisans or Indian captains of industry, but plenty of small shopkeepers and big middlemen to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>help</span> conquer & keep India as a milch cow for British trade & British capital.\n\nThus all the great types which are nurtured on war, politics, thought, spirituality, activity & enterprise, the outgrowths of a vigorous and healthy national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span>, the high fruits of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>humanity</span> who are the very <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>energy</span> of life to a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>community</span>, were discouraged and tended to disappear and in their place there was an enormous demand for the bourgeois qualities. The safe, respectable man, satisfied with ease and not ambitions of command, content with contemporary repute and not hankering after <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>immortality</span>, the superficial man who unable to think profoundly could yet pose among his peers as intellectual, who getting no true culture, wore a specious appearance of education, who guiltless of a single true sacrifice for his country, yet bulked large as a patriot, found an undisputed field open to him. The rewards of life now depended on certain outward signs of merit<span class='page-number' id='s-1100' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1100]</span> which were purely conventional. An University degree, knowledge of English, possession of a post in Government service or a professional diploma, a Government title, European clothes or a sleek dress and appearance, a big house full of English furniture, these were the badges by which Society recognized its chosen. These signs were all purely conventional. The degree did not necessarily denote a good education nor the knowledge of English a wide culture or successful living into new ideas, nor the Government post administrative <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>capacity</span>, nor the diploma special fitness for the profession, nor the title any merit in the holder, nor the big house or fine dress a mastery of the art of social life, nor the English clothes, European grit, science and enterprise. They were merely counters borrowed from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>, but universally taken, as they are not usually taken in Europe or any living nation, as a sufficient substitute for the reality. Wealth, success, and certain outward signs of a facile respectability had become to our new civilised & refined society the supreme tests of the man.\n\nAll these were conditions unusually favourable to a rank luxuriance of the bourgeois type, which thrives upon superficiality and lives by convention. The soil was suitably shallow, the atmosphere sufficiently warm & humid. The circumstances of our national life & the unique character of our education hastened & perfected the growth. Both were characterized by the false appearance of breadth covering an almost miraculous superficiality. Our old Indian life was secluded, but lofty & intense, like a pine-tree on the mountain-tops, like a tropical island in unvisited seas; our new life parted with the loftiness & intensity when it lost the isolation, but it boasted in vain of an added breadth, for it was really more provincial & narrow than the old, which had at least given room for the development of all our human faculties. The news of the world's life poured in on us through the foreign telegrams & papers, we read English books, we talked about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>economics</span> and politics, science & history, enlightenment & education, Rousseau, Mill, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bentham</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Burke</span>, and used the language of a life that was not ours, in the vain <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>belief</span> that so we became cosmopolitans and men of enlightenment.<span class='page-number' id='s-1101' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1101]</span> Yet all the time India was as much & more outside the great life of the world than it was in the days of Mahomad Tughlak or Bahadur Shah. The number of men in educated India who had any vital conception or any real understanding & mastery of the great currents of life, thought & motive which sway the vast world outside, was always wonderfully small. It could not be otherwise; for the life of that world was not our life, nor was our life any part of the world's, any more than the days of a prisoner in a gaol or reformatory are part of the free activity of society. The thunder of great wars, the grand collision and struggle of world-moving ideas and mighty interests, the swift & strong currents of scientific discovery and discussion, the intellectual change & stir, the huge & feverish pulsation of commercial competition from <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>China</span> to Peru, all this was to us as the scenes in the street to a man watching from his prison bars. We might take a deep & excited interest, we might almost persuade ourselves by the vividness of our interest that we were part of the scene, but if a voice within cried to us, \"Out, out, you too into the battle & the struggle and the joy & stir of this great world's life,\" the cold iron of the window-bars and the hard stone of the prison walls stood between. The jailer might not jingle his keys obtrusively nor the warder flourish his baton, but we knew well they were there. And we really believed in the bland promise that if we conducted ourselves well, we should some day get tickets of leave. We read & thought but did not live what we read & thought. So our existence grew ever more artificial and unreal. The fighter and the thinker in us dwindled & the bourgeois flourished and grew.\n\nContentment with an artificial existence, the habit of playing with counters as if they were true coin of life, made the old rich flood of vitality, strong character, noble aspiration, excellent achievement run ever shallower & thinner in our veins. So we accepted and made the best of an ignoble ease.\n\nOur education too had just the same pride in a false show of breadth and the same confined and narrow scope. In our schools & colleges we were set to remember many things, but learned nothing. We had no real mastery of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English literature</span>, though<span class='page-number' id='s-1102' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1102]</span> we read <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Milton</span> & Burke and quoted <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Byron</span> & Shelley, nor of history though we talked about <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Magna Charta</span> & Runnymede, nor of philosophy though we could mispronounce the names of most of the German philosophers, nor science though we used its name daily, nor even of our own thought & civilisation though its discussion filled columns of our periodicals. We knew little & knew it badly. And even we could not profit by the little we knew for advance, for origination; even those who struggled to a wider knowledge proved barren soil. The springs of originality were fast growing atrophied by our unnatural existence. The great men among us who strove to originate were the spiritual children of an older time who still drew sap from the roots of our ancient culture and had the energy of the Mogul times in their blood. But their success was not commensurate with their genius & with each generation these grew rarer & rarer. The sap soon began to run dry, the energy to dwindle away. Worse than the narrowness & inefficiency, was the unreality of our culture. Our brains were as full of liberty as our lives were empty of it. We read and talked so much of political rights that we never so much as realized that we had none to call our own. The very sights & sounds, the description of which formed the staple of our daily reading, were such as most of us would at no time see or hear. We learned science without <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>observation</span> of the objects of science, words & not the things which they symbolised, literature by rote, philosophy as a lesson to be got by heart, not as a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>guide</span> to truth or a light shed on existence. We read of and believed in English economy, while we lived under Indian conditions, and worshipped the free trade which was starving us to death as a nation. We professed notions of equality, and separated ourselves from the people, of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span>, and were the servants of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>absolutism</span>. We pattered off speeches & essays about social reform, yet had no idea of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nature</span> of a society. We looked to sources of strength and inspiration we could not reach and left those untapped which were ours by possession and inheritance. We knew so little of life that we expected others who lived on our service to prepare our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, so little of history that we thought reform could precede liberty, so little of science that we<span class='page-number' id='s-1103' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1103]</span> believed an organism could be reshaped from outside. We were ruled by shopkeepers and consented enthusiastically to think of them as angels. We affected virtues we were given no opportunity of assimilating and lost those our <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fathers</span> had handed down to us. All this in perfect good faith, in the full belief that we were Europeanising ourselves, and moving rapidly toward political, social, economical, moral, intellectual progress. The consummation of our political progress was a Congress which yearly passed resolutions it had no power to put in practice, statesmen whose highest function was to ask questions which need not even be answered, councillors who would have been surprised if they had been consulted, politicians who did not even know that a Right never lives until it has a Might to support it. Socially we have initiated a feeble attempt to revivify the very basis of our society by a few petty mechanical changes instead of a spiritual renovation which could alone be equal to so high a task; economically, we attained great success in destroying our industries and enslaving ourselves to the British trader; morally, we successfully compassed the disintegration of the old moral ideas & habits and substituted for them a superficial respectability; intellectually, we prided ourselves [on] the tricking out of our minds in a few leavings, scraps and strays of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>European thought</span> at the sacrifice of an immense and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>eternal</span> heritage. Never was an education more remote from all that education truly denotes; instead of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> the keys to the vast mass of modern knowledge, or creating rich soil for the qualities that conquer circumstance & survive, they made the mind swallow a heterogeneous jumble of mainly useless information; trained a tame parrot to live in a cage & talk of the joys of the forest. British rule, Britain's civilizing mission in India has been the record success in history in the hypnosis of a nation. It persuaded us to live in a death of the will & its activities, taking a series of hallucinations for real things and creating in ourselves the condition of morbid weakness the hypnotist desired, until the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Master</span> of a mightier hypnosis laid His finger on India's eyes and cried \"Awake.\" Then only the spell was broken, the slumbering mind realised itself and the dead soul lived again.<span class='page-number' id='s-1104' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1104]</span>\n\nBut the education which was poison to all true <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>elements</span> of national strength and greatness, was meat & drink to the bourgeois. The bourgeois delights in convention, because truth is too hard a taskmaster and makes too severe a demand on character, energy & <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>intellect</span>.

He cannot give up his life to his country, but if she will be grateful for a few of his leisure hours, he will give in those limits ungrudging service & preen himself on his public virtues. Prodigal charity would be uncomfortable & unwise, but if he can earn applause by parting with a fraction of his superfluities, he is always ready for the sacrifice. Deep scholarship would unfit him for his part in life, but if figuring in learned societies or writing a few articles and essays, an occasional book guiltless of uncomfortable originality, or a learned compilation prepared under his superintendence and issued in his name will make him a man of letters, he will court & prize that easily-earned reputation. The <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>effort</span> to remould society and rebuild the nation is too huge and perilous a task for a comfortable citizen, but he is quite prepared to condemn old & inconvenient institutions & superstitions and lend his hand to a few changes which will make social life more pleasant and comfortable. Superficiality, unreality of thought & deed thus became the stamp of all our activities.\n\nThose who say that the new spirit in India which, before nascent & concealed, started to conscious life in the Swadeshi agitation and has taken Swadeshi, Swaraj and Self-help as its motto, is nothing new but a natural development of the old, are minds blinded by the habits of thought of the past century. The new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> is the very antithesis, the complete and vehement negation of the old. The old <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> sought to make a wider circle of activity, freer living-room and a more comfortable and eminent position for the bourgeois, to prolong the unnatural & evil conditions of which the subject nations died under the civilizing rule of Rome and which British rule has recreated for India; the new seeks to replace the bourgeois by the Samurai<span class='page-number' id='s-1105' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1105]</span> and to shatter the prison house which the nineteenth century made for our mother and build anew a palace for her glory, a garden for her pleasure, a free domain for her freedom & her pride. The old looked only to the power & interests of the educated, enlightened middle class, and shrank from the ignorant, the uneducated, the livers in the past, the outer unilluminated barbarian, drawing aside the hem of its robes lest it should touch impurity. The new overleaps every barrier; it calls to the clerk at his counter, the trader in his shop, the peasant at his plough; it summons the Brahmin from his temple and takes the hand [of] the Chandala in his degradation; it seeks out the student in his College, the schoolboy at his books, it touches the very child in its mother's arms & the secluded zenana has thrilled to its voice; its eye searches the jungle for the Santal and travels the hills for the wild tribes of the mountains. It cares nothing for age or sex or <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>caste</span> or wealth or education or respectability; it mocks at the talk of a stake in the country; it spurns aside the demand for a property qualification or a certificate of literacy. It speaks to the illiterate or the man in the street in such rude vigorous language as he best understands, to youth & the enthusiast in accents of poetry, in language of fire, to the thinker in the terms of philosophy and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span>, to the Hindu it repeats the name of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Kali</span>, to the Mahomedan it spurs to action for the glory of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span>. It cries to all to come forth, to help in God's work & remake a nation, each with what his creed or his culture, his strength, his manhood or his genius can give to the new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span>. The only qualification it asks for is a body made in the womb of an Indian mother, a heart that can feel for India, a brain that can think and plan for her greatness, a tongue that can adore her name or hands that can fight in her quarrel. The old shunned sacrifice & suffering, the new rushes to embrace it. The old gave a wide berth to the jail and the rods & scourges of Power; the new walks straight to meet them. The old shuddered at the idea of revolution; the new is ready to set the whole country in turmoil for the sake of an idea. The old bent the knee to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Caesar</span> and presented him a list of grievances; the new leaves his presence or dragged back to it, stands erect and defies him in the midst of his legions.<span class='page-number' id='s-1106' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1106]</span>\n\nThe initial condition of recovering our liberty meant a peril and a gigantic struggle from the very possibility of which we averted our eyes in a panic of bourgeois terror. It was safer & easier to cheat ourselves into believing in a contradiction and living a lie. Yet nothing could be more fatal, more insidiously destructive to the roots of manhood. It is far better to fall and bleed for ever in a hopeless but unremitting struggle than to drink of that draught of death and lethe. A people true to itself, a race that hopes to live, will not comfort itself and sap its manhood by the opiate of empty formulas and specious falsehoods; it will prefer eternal suffering & disaster. For in truth, as our old thinkers used always to insist, the whole universe stands; truth is the root and condition of life and to believe a lie, to live in a lie, is to deliver oneself to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>disease</span> and death. The belief that a subject nation can acquiesce in subjection and yet make true & vital progress, growing to strength in its chains, is a lie. The idea that mitigations of subjection constitute freedom or prepare a race for freedom or that anything but the exercise of liberty fits man for liberty, is another lie. The teaching that peace and security are more important and vital to man than liberty is a third lie. Yet all these lies and many others we believed in, hugged to our hearts and made the law of our thoughts throughout the nineteenth century. The result was stagnation, or a progress in weakness and disintegration.\n\nThe doctrine that social & commercial progress must precede or will of themselves bring about political strength & liberty, is a fourth & very dangerous lie; for a nation is no aggregate of separable functions, but a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>harmony</span> of functions, of which government and political arrangement is the oldest, most central and most vital and determines the others.\n\nOur only hope of resurgence was in some such great unsealing of the eyes to the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span> in which we existed and the discovery of some effective mantra, some strong spiritual impulse which should have the power to renovate us from within. For good or for evil the middle class now leads in India, and whatever saving impulse comes to the nation, must come from the middle class, whatever upward movement begins, it must initiate and lead.<span class='page-number' id='s-1107' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1107]</span> But for that to happen the middle class must by a miracle be transfigured and lifted above itself; the natural breeding ground of the bourgeois, it must become the breeding ground of the Samurai. It must cease in fact to be a middle class and turn itself into an <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>aristocracy</span>, an aristocracy not of birth or landed possessions, not of intellect, not of wealth and commercial enterprise, but of character and action. India must recover her faculty for self-sacrifice, courage and high aspiration. Such a transformation is the work which has been set before itself by the new Nationalism; this is at the back of all its enthusiasm, audacity & turbulence and provides the explanation of all that has shocked and alarmed the wise men and the elders in the movement in Bengal. The new Nationalism is a creed, but it is more than a creed; it is a method, but more than a method. The new Nationalism is an attempt at a spiritual transformation of the nineteenth century Indian; it is a notice of dismissal or at least of suspension to the bourgeois and all his ideas and ways and works, a call for men who will dare & do impossibilities, the men of extremes, the men of faith, the prophets, the martyrs, the crusaders, the [...] & rebels, the desperate venturers and reckless doers, the initiators of revolutions.

For there is a great deal in a name in spite of Shakespeare. A name attached to a political party or school of thought not only serves to show the temper and point of view of the giver, but it helps greatly to colour contemporary ideas about the party it seeks to exalt or disparage. The advanced men whom Anglo-Indian and Moderate unite in branding as Extremists, have always repudiated the misleading designation. At first they preferred to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> themselves the New School; they now claim the style of Nationalists; a claim which has been angrily objected to on the ground that the rest of the Congress party are as <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> Nationalists as the forward party.

It is an attempt to relegate the dominant bourgeois in us to his old obscurity, to transform the bourgeois into the Samurai and through him to extend the workings of the Samurai spirit to the whole nation. Or to put it more broadly, it is an attempt to create a new nation in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> by reviving in spirit & <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>action</span> ancient Indian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>character</span>, the strong, great and lofty spirit of old Aryavarta, and setting it to use and mould the methods and materials of modernity for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>freedom</span>, greatness and well-being of a historic and immortal people. This is not, I am well aware, a description under which the ordinary Congress politician will recognize what he prefers to disparage as Extremism, but it will be well understood by those who are constant readers of the Nationalist journals in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bengal</span>, whether the Bande Mataram or New India or vernacular journals like the Yugantar, the Nabasakti or the Sandhya.[^1] Whatever their differences of temper, tone or style, however the methods they recommend may differ in detail, they are united by a common <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>faith</span> and a common spirit; a common faith in India, not in an Anglicised and transmogrified nation unrecognizable as Indians, but in India of the immemorial past, India of the clouded but fateful present, India leonine, mighty, crowned with her imperial diadem of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span>; a common spirit of enthusiasm, hope, the desire to dare and do <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>all</span> things so that our vision of her future may be fulfilled greatly and soon. This is the heart of Nationalism. The ordinary Congress politician's ideas of Nationalism are associated with heated discussions in Committee and Congress, altercations at public meetings, unsparing criticisms of successful and eminent respectabilities, sedition trials, National Volunteers, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>East</span> Bengal disturbances, Rawalpindi riots.

(It is the bourgeois view of the type destined to push him aside & supplant him and like all such views born of a panic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>fear</span> & <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span>, it is a caricature and not a description.)[^2] He has no clear idea of the aim and drift of Extremism.

To get at the heart of Nationalism we must first clear away some of the misconceptions with which its realities have been clouded. We must know what Nationalism is not before we ask what it is.\n\nExtremism in the sense of unreasoning violence of spirit and the preference of desperate methods, because they are desperate, is not the heart of Nationalism. The Nationalist is no advocate of lawlessness for its own sake, on the contrary he has a deeper respect for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>essence</span> of law than anyone else, because the building up of a nation is his objective and he knows well that without a profound reverence for law national <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> cannot persist and attain a sound and healthy development. But he qualifies his respect for legality by the proviso that the law he is called upon to obey is the law of the nation, an outgrowth of its organic <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>existence</span> and part of its own accepted system of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>government</span>.<span class='page-number' id='s-1111' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1111]</span> A law imposed from outside can command only the interested <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>obedience</span> of those whose chief demand from life is the safety of their persons and property or the timid obedience of those who understand the danger of breaking the law. The claim made by it is an utilitarian, not a moral claim. Farther the Nationalist never loses sight of the truth that law was made for <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span> and not man for the law. Its chief function and reason for existence is to safeguard and foster the growth and happy flowering into strength and health of national life and a law which does not subserve this end or which opposes and contradicts this end, however rigidly it may enforce peace, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span> and security, forfeits its claim to respect and obedience. Nationalism refuses to accept Law as a fetish or peace and security as an aim in themselves; the only idol of its worship is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationality</span> and the only aim in itself it recognizes is the freedom, power and well-being of the nation. It will not prefer violent or strenuous methods simply because they are violent or strenuous, but neither will it cling to mild and peaceful methods simply because they are mild and peaceful. It asks of a method whether it is effective for its purpose, whether it is worthy of a great people struggling to be, whether it is educative of national strength and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>activity</span>, and these things ascertained, it asks nothing farther.

He will embrace suffering as a lover and clasp the hand of Anarchy like that of a trusted friend,â€”if so it must be; for it is not his temper to take the inevitable grudgingly or to serve or struggle with half a heart. If that is Extremism and fanaticism, he is an Extremist and a fanatic; but not for their own sake, not out of a disordered love for anarchy and turmoil, not in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>madness</span> & desperation, but out of a reasoned conviction and courageous acceptance of the natural laws that demand this sacrifice in return for so great a promise.

He is ready to lead the chosen people into the desert for its long wanderings, though he knows that often in the bitterness of its sufferings it will murmur and rebel against his leadership and raise its hand to stone him to death as the author of its misery, for he knows that beyond is the promised land flowing with milk and honey which the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Divine</span> Voice has told him that those who are faithful, will reach and possess.

We have studied in the schools of the West and learned to ape the thoughts and language of the West forgetting our own deeper ideas and truer speech, and to the West the nation is the country, so much land containing so <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> millions of men who speak <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> speech and live one political <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> owing allegiance to a single governing power of its own choosing.

The Indian idea of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nationality</span> ought to be truer and deeper. The philosophy of our forefathers looked through the gross <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>body</span> of things and discovered a subtle body within, looked through that and found yet another more deeply hidden, and within the third body discovered the Source of life and form, seated for ever, unchanging and imperishable. What is true of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span> object, is true also of the general and universal. What is true of the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, is true also of the nation. The country, the land is only the outward body of the nation, its *annamaya kosh*, or gross physical body; the mass of people, the life of millions who occupy and vivify the body of the nation with their presence, is the *pranamaya kosh*, the life-body of the nation. These two are the gross body, the physical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>manifestation</span> of the Mother. Within the gross body is a subtler body, the thoughts, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>, the philosophy, the mental and emotional activities, the sum of hopes, pleasures, aspirations, fulfilments, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span> and culture, which make up the *sukshma sharir* of the nation.

To tell that man that he must desist from using the first effective weapon that comes to his hand because the blow would be an act of hate, is precisely on a par with this deprecation of boycott. Doubtless the self-defender is not precisely actuated by <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>feelings</span> of holy sweetness towards his assailant, but to expect so much from human nature is impracticable.

The pride in our past, the pain of our present, the passion for the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>future</span> are its trunk and branches. Self-sacrifice, self-forgetfulness, great service and high <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>endurance</span> for the country are its fruit. And the sap which keeps it alive is the realisation of the Motherhood of God in the country, the vision of the Mother, the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>knowledge</span> of the Mother, the perpetual <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>contemplation</span>, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>adoration</span> and service of the Mother.\n\n---\n\nOther love than this is foreign to the motives of political action. Between <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>nation</span> and nation there is justice, partiality, chivalry, duty but not love. All love is either <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>individual</span>, or for the self in the race or for the self in mankind. It may exist between individuals of different races, but the love of one race for another is a thing foreign to nature. When, therefore, the boycott as declared by the Indian race against the British is stigmatised for want of love, the charge is bad psychology as well as bad morality. It is interest warring against interest, and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>hatred</span> is directed not really against the race but against the adverse interest. If the British exploitation were to cease tomorrow, the hatred against the British race would disappear in a moment. A partial *adhyaropa* makes the ignorant for the moment see in the exploiters and not in the exploitation the receptacle of the hostile feeling. But like all <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Maya</span> it is an unreal and fleeting sentiment and is not shared by those who think. Not hatred against foreigners, but antipathy to the evils of foreign exploitation is the true root of boycott.\n\n---\n\nIf hatred is demoralising, it is also stimulating. The web of life has been made a mingled strain of <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span> and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>evil</span> and God works<span class='page-number' id='s-1119' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1119]</span> His ends through the evil as well as through the good. Let us discharge our minds of hate, but let us not deprecate a great and necessary <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>movement</span> because in the inevitable course of human nature, it has engendered feelings of hostility and hatred. If hatred came, it was necessary that it should come as a stimulus, as a means of awakening. When *tamas*, <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>inertia</span>, torpor have benumbed a nation, the strongest <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>forms</span> of *rajas* are necessary to break the spell, and there is no form of *rajas* so strong as hatred. Through *rajas* we rise to *sattwa*, and for the Indian temperament, the transition does not take long. Already the element of hatred is <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>giving</span> place to the clear conception of love for the Mother as the spring of our political actions.\n\n---\n\nAnother question is the use of violence in the furtherance of boycott. This is, in our view, purely a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> of policy and expediency. An act of violence brings us into conflict with the law and such a conflict may be inexpedient for a race circumstanced like ours. But the moral question does not arise. The argument that to use violence is to interfere with personal liberty involves a singular misunderstanding of the very nature of politics. The whole of politics is an interference with personal liberty. Law is such an interference, Protection is such an interference, the rule which makes the will of the majority prevail is such an interference. The right to prevent such use of personal liberty as will injure the interests of the race, is the fundamental law of society. From this point of view the nation is only using its primary right when it restrains the individual from buying or selling foreign goods.\n\n---\n\nIt may be argued that peaceful compulsion is one thing and violent compulsion another. Social boycott may be justifiable, but not the burning or drowning of British goods. The latter method, we reply, is illegal and therefore may be inexpedient, but it is not morally unjustifiable. The morality of the Kshatriya justifies<span class='page-number' id='s-1120' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1120]</span> violence in times of war, and boycott is a war. Nobody blames the Americans for throwing British tea into Boston harbour, nor can anybody blame similar action in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>India</span> on moral grounds. It is reprehensible from the point of view of law, of social peace and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>order</span>, not of political morality. It has been eschewed by us because it is unwise and carries the battle on to a ground where we are comparatively weak, from a ground where we are strong. Under other circumstances we might have followed the American precedent, and if we had done so, historians and moralists would have applauded, not censured.\n\n---\n\nJustice and righteousness are the atmosphere of political morality, but the justice and righteousness of the fighter, not of the priest. Aggression is unjust only when unprovoked, violence unrighteous when used wantonly or for unrighteous ends. It is a barren philosophy which applies a mechanical rule to all actions, or takes a word and tries to fit all human life into it. The sword of the warrior is as necessary to the fulfilment of justice and righteousness as the holiness of the saint. Ramdas is not complete without Shivaji. To maintain justice and prevent the strong from despoiling and the weak from being oppressed is the function for which the Kshatriya was created. Therefore, says Sri <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Krishna</span> in the Mahabharat, God created battle and armour, the sword, the bow and the dagger.<span class='page-number' id='s-1121' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1121]</span>","url":"/cwsa/07/the-morality-of-boycott","volt":"Bande Mataram - II","autn":"Sri Aurobindo","auth":"sa","cmpn":"The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo","comp":"cwsa","vol":"07","path":[{"t":"CWSA","u":"/cwsa"},{"t":"Bande Mataram - II","u":"/cwsa/07"},{"t":"Book Two"},{"t":"Writings from Manuscripts"}],"nxtt":"A Fragment","nxtu":"/cwsa/07/a-fragment","prvt":"The Mother and the Nation","prvu":"/cwsa/07/the-mother-and-the-nation","items":[]},{"_id":"000000000000000000000000","_slugs":["a-fragment"],"t":"A Fragment","showFrench":false,"hasPage":true,"yrs":0,"yre":0,"txt":"<span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mankind</span> is of a less terrestrial mould than some would have him to be.

For\n\nMr. John Morley is a very great <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>man</span>, a very remarkable and exceptional man. I have been reading his Arbroath speech again and my admiration for him has risen to boiling point, so that I am at last obliged to let it bubble over into the columns of the Bande Mataram. Mr. Morley differs from ordinary mortals in three very important respects; first, he is a literary man; secondly, he is a philosopher, thirdly he is a politician. This would not <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>matter</span> much if he kept his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>literature</span>, philosophy & politics apart; but he doesn't. He is a literary philosopher or a philosophic litterateur; better than this he is a literary philosopher-politician. This is a superlative combination; <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>God</span> cannot better it & the devil does not want to. For if an ordinary man steals, he steals and no more bones are made about it; he gets caught and is sent to prison, or he is not and goes on his way rejoicing; in either case the matter is a simple <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>one</span> without any artistic possibilities; but if a literary philosopher steals, he steals on the basis of the great & eternal verities and in the choicest and most poetical <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>English</span>. An ordinary man may be illogical and silly and everybody realizes that he is illogical and silly. But the philosopher is logically illogical and talks nonsense according to the strictest rules of philosophical reasoning, and the literary man will be brilliantly foolish and illogically convincing. An ordinary man may turn his back on his principles and he will be called a turncoat, or break all the commandments and be punished by the law & society, unless, of course, he is a millionaire or a member of the ruling race in Indiaâ€”but the literary philosopher will reconcile his principles and his conduct by an appeal to a fur-coat or a syllogism from a pair of Northampton boots. He will abrogate all the ten commandments on the strength of a solar topi.<span class='page-number' id='s-1126' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1126]</span>\n\nA politician again will lie and people will perceive it and take it as a matter of course; but a literary philosopher politician will easily prove to you that when he is most a liar, then he is most truthful and when he is juggling most cynically with truth & principle, then he most deserves the name of Honest John; and he will do it in such well turned periods that one must have a very bad ear for the rhythm of sentences to quarrel with his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>logic</span>. Oh yes, a literary philosopher politician is the choicest work of Heaven, when he is not the most splendid <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>instrument</span> in the hands of the Prince of Darkness. For the Prince of Darkness is not only a gentlemen, as Shakespeare discovered, but a gentlemen of artistic perceptions who knows a fine and carefully-worked tool when he sees it and loves to handle it with the best dexterity and <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>grace</span> of which he is capable.\n\nThere are other reasons for which I admire Mr. John Morley. I admire him for what he has done not only for the way in which he has done it. It is true he is not so great a man as his <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>master</span> Gladstone, who was the biggest opportunist and most adroit political gambler <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>democracy</span> has till now engendered and yet persuaded the world that he was an enthusiast and a man of high religious feeling and principle. But Gladstone was a <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>genius</span> and his old henchman is only a man of talent. Still Mr. Morley has done the best of which he is capable and that is by no means a poor best. He has served the devil in the name of God with signal success on two occasions. The first was when he championed the cause of the financiers in Egypt, the men who gamble with the destinies of nations, who make <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>money</span> out of the groans of the people and coin into gold the blood of patriots and the tears of widows & when, abusing his position as an influential journalist, he lied to the British public about Arabi and urged on Gladstone to crush the movement of democratic and humanitarian <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Nationalism</span> in Egypt, that movement in which all that is noble, humane and gracious in <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Islam</span> sought to find fulfilment and a small field on earth for the fine flowering of a new <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Mahomedan</span> <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>civilisation</span>. The second is now when he is trying in the sordid interests of British capital to crush the<span class='page-number' id='s-1127' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1127]</span> resurgent <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>life</span> of India and baffle the attempt of the children of Vedanta to recover their own country for the development of a revivified <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Indian civilisation</span>.

Truly, Satan knows his own and sees to it that they do not their great work negligently.\n\nMr. Morley is a great bookman, a great democrat, a great exponent of principles. No man better fitted than he to prove that when great human movements are <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>being</span> suppressed by the sword and the prison, it is done in the interests of humanity; that when a people struggling to live is trampled down by repression, pushed back by the use of the Goorkha and the hooligan, the warder's lash & the whipping post into the hell of misery & famine & starvation, of insult & ignominy & bondage from which it dared to hope for an escape, the motive of the oppressor finds its root in a very agony of conscientiousness, and it is with a sobbing & bleeding <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>heart</span> that he presses his heel on the people's throat for their own <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>good</span>; that the ruthless exploitation and starvation of a country by foreign leeches is one of the best services that can be done to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mankind</span>; the international crimes of the great captains of finance a work of civilisation and the brutal & selfish immolation of nations to Mammon an acceptable <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>offering</span> on the altar of the indwelling God in humanity. But these things have been said & done before; they are the usual & blasphemous cant of nineteenth-century devil-worship formulated when <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Commerce</span> began to take the place once nominally allowed to <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Christ</span> and the ledger became <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Europe</span>'s <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>Bible</span>.

I was born on the 15th August 1872, and on that anniversary in 1906 the National College opened its doors to teach among other things, the principles of Swadeshism. It was either the day before or the day after my birthday, 1907,\" he continued waxing warm with the subject \"that I was arrested in connection with the first 'Bande Mataram' sedition case. And more remarkable still my birthday is round again today and the Magistrate has given a definite assurance that he will commit on the evidence given in this, a case not of sedition but revolution.\n\n\"Besides all this my brother [Barindra][^1] is threatened on my birthday to be charged with abetment of murder in the Mozufferpore affair, besides having to stand his trial for conspiracy.<span class='page-number' id='s-1145' style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0);position:relative;top:-8px;background-color:rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.96);'>[p.1145]</span> These are what I <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>call</span> a remarkable string of coincidences,\" he added with a smile.\n\n[^1]: *MS* Birendro\n\n\"Are we getting tired of this protracted trial you ask? Well, to be candid we are, although we don't <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>mind</span> it in the least.

I certainly have edited the 'Bande Mataram,' but this I only did on different occasions when Bepin Babu first edited it, and I will state now once and for all I never, never did occupy its editorial chair. I must also deny that I fathered the <span class='underline' style='text-decoration: underline !important;text-decoration-color:rgb(36, 164, 223) !important'>many</span> brilliant leaders that have appeared in that paper. I certainly did write some of them, but I cannot claim the authorship of the best of them.
